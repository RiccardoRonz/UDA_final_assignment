BUSINESS Baker Hughes Company (\"Baker Hughes\", \"the Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") is an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain.  Built on a century of experience and conducting business in over 120 countries, our innovative technologies and services are taking energy forward.  The Company was formed in July 2017 from the combination between Baker Hughes Incorporated (\"BHI\") and the oil and gas business (\"GE O&G\") of General Electric Company (\"GE\").  As a result of the combination, substantially all of the business of GE O&G and of BHI was transferred to a subsidiary of the Company, Baker Hughes Holdings LLC (\"BHH LLC\").  BHH LLC is a Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") registrant with separate filing requirements with the SEC.  OUR VISION & STRATEGY With the breadth of our portfolio, leading technology, and unique partnership models, we are positioned to deliver outcome-based solutions across the energy and industrial markets.  By integrating health, safety & environment (\"HSE\") into everything we do, we protect our people, our customers, and the environment. The oil and gas macroeconomic environment continues to be dynamic.  We believe the world\u2019s reliance on hydrocarbons will not disappear, and oil and gas will continue to remain relevant in meeting global energy demand.  At the same time, the transition to new energy sources is accelerating, with governments and society focused on a long-term goal of net-zero emissions while trying to balance the \u201cenergy trilemma\u201d - energy security, sustainability, and affordability - for at least the foreseeable future.  We believe the industry is going through a transformation that requires a change in how we work.  Irrespective of commodity prices, our customers are focused on reducing both capital and operating expenditures.  Our existing and new customers expect new partnership and commercial models and new technology solutions to deliver sustainable productivity improvements and leverage economies of scale, with a lower carbon footprint.  That is why our strategy is focused on improving our core competitiveness and delivering higher-productivity solutions today, while positioning to lead the energy transition while solving the energy trilemma. Our strategy is based on three key pillars: \u2022Transform the core: We are transforming our current business to improve margins and cash flow, which we are achieving through portfolio rationalization, cost improvements, and new business models. \u2022Invest for growth: We are driving organic and inorganic growth in high potential segments where we have a strong position, including industrial power and processes, industrial asset management, non-metallics, and chemicals. \u2022Position for new energy frontiers: We are making strategic investments to drive lower carbon emissions in the energy and industrial sectors, including hydrogen, geothermal, carbon capture, utilization and storage (\"CCUS\"), and clean power solutions. We expect to benefit from our strategy in the following ways: \u2022Scope and scale: We have a global presence and a broad, diversified portfolio.  Our products, services, and expertise serve the upstream, midstream/liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry, as well as broader chemical and industrial segments.  We deliver through our two operating segments: Oilfield Services & Equipment (\"OFSE\") and Industrial & Energy Technology (\"IET\") as discussed below under \"Products and Services,\" and each are among the top four providers for the majority of the product lines in the markets they serve. \u2022Technology: Our culture is built on a heritage of innovation and invention in research and development, with complementary capabilities.

In addition to enhancing our technology portfolio with new AI applications, we are creating a digital element in our core OFSE product lines, helping them to deliver efficiency, predictability, and a better experience for our customers and ourselves.  We have also continued to invest in our industrial asset management capabilities in IET, including the acquisition of ARMS Reliability and an investment in Augury, a machine health technology company, to support our customers\u2019 digital transformation programs across industrial end markets. In September 2022, we announced a restructuring and reorganization effective October 1, 2022, to create two operating segments focused on different growth profiles and designed to simplify our operations and enhance profitability.  These two operating segments are Oilfield Services & Equipment, which integrates our previous segments Oilfield Services and Oilfield Equipment, and Industrial & Energy Technology, which integrates our previous segments Turbomachinery & Process Solutions and Digital Solutions.  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Our two operating segments are organized based on the nature of our markets and customers and consist of similar products and services and growth profiles.  We sell to our customers through direct and indirect channels.  Our primary sales channel is through our direct sales force, which has a strong regional focus with local teams close to the customer, who are able to draw support from centers of excellence in each of our major product lines.  Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and the competitive environment varies by product line.  See discussion below by segment. Oilfield Services & Equipment The OFSE segment designs and manufactures products and provides related services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of an asset, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning. The OFSE segment is organized into four product lines. \u2022Well Construction focuses on drilling and includes drilling services (directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, surface logging, and remote operations), drill bits (polycrystalline, roller cone, hybrid, and in-bit sensing), and drilling & completions fluids (emulsion-based fluids, water-based fluids, specialty fluids, drill-in fluids, waste management, and completion fluids). \u2022Completions, Intervention, & Measurements encompasses completions (wellbore construction, upper and lower completions, unconventional multistage completions, intelligent production systems, workover systems, and fishing and through-tubing services), pressure pumping (cementing, production enhancement, and coiled tubing and tubular running services), and wireline services (openhole logging services, cased-hole logging services, and perforating and drill stem-testing services). Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 2 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 2 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 2   \u2022Production Solutions spans artificial lift systems (electrical submersible pumping systems, surface pumping systems, rigless deployment systems, and sensors and gauges) and oilfield & industrial chemicals (upstream chemicals, downstream chemicals, and Aquaness wholesale chemicals). \u2022Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems includes subsea projects and services (subsea trees, controls, manifolds, wellheads, premium casing connectors, installation and commissioning, repairs and maintenance, well intervention, life-of-field solutions, and plug and abandonment), flexible pipe systems (subsea risers, subsea flowlines and jumpers, onshore reinforced thermoplastic pipe, and rehabilitation), and surface pressure control systems (surface trees and wellheads). These product lines are supported by an OFSE digital group, which joins the segment\u2019s domain expertise with a deep understanding of digital technology to improve operational safety, performance, and sustainability.  Reservoir analysis proficiencies are rooted in evaluation technologies, a team of reservoir experts, and software.

OFSE also provides integrated well services and solutions to plan and execute projects ranging from well construction and production through well abandonment, in addition to integrated services and solutions for the subsea environment. OFSE customers include large integrated major and super-major oil and natural gas companies; U.S. and international independent oil and natural gas companies; national or state-owned oil companies; engineering, procurement, and construction contractors; geothermal companies; and other oilfield service companies. OFSE believes that its principal competitive differentiators in the industries and markets it serves are the quality, efficiency, reliability, and availability of its products and services.  A continued commitment to service delivery, HSE standards, technical proficiency, and competitive pricing is also a key factor in its success. OFSE products and services are sold in highly competitive markets, and revenue and earnings are affected by changes in commodity prices; fluctuations in levels of drilling, workover and completion activity in major markets; general economic conditions; foreign currency exchange fluctuations; and governmental regulations.  While OFSE may have contracts that include multiple well projects and that may extend over a period ranging from two to four years, its services and products are generally provided on a well-by-well basis.  Most contracts cover pricing of the products and services, along with various limitations on liability, but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use OFSE products and services.  OFSE competitors include SLB and Halliburton (Well Construction; Completions, Intervention, & Measurements; Production Solutions; Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems); ChampionX (Production Solutions); and TechnipFMC, Aker Solutions, and NOV (Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems).

CONTRACTS We conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments, including fixed-fee or turnkey contracts, transactional agreements for products and services, and long-term aftermarket service agreements. We enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on long-term project contracts and master service agreements.  Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer\u2019s technical specifications with little or no relief available due to changes in circumstances.  In some cases, failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims.  We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers. We strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices.  Our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of their employees and often their contractors; the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment, and often that of their  contractors; pollution originating from their equipment or facility; and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, including loss or damage to the well or reservoir, loss of well control, fire, explosion, or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas.  Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of our employees and often that of our subcontractors; the loss of or damage to our equipment; and surface pollution originating from our equipment while under our control.  Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices, we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence and include an overall limitation of liability clause.  It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss, including loss of profits and loss of revenue, in all customer contracts. Our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case.  Certain U.S. states have enacted oil and natural gas specific anti-indemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract.  Applicable law or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct.  We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products.  It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any end-user claims, but this is not always possible.  Similarly, government agencies and other third parties may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified  Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 5 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 5 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 5   and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault.  We have an established process to review any risk deviations from our standard contracting practices. The Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable; however, clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program.  All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible and/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions.  There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business.  ORDERS AND REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS Remaining performance obligations, a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), are unfilled customer orders for products and product services excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty, even if the likelihood of cancellation is remote based on historical experience.  For product services, an amount is included for the expected life of the contract. We recognized orders of $26.8 billion, $21.7 billion and $20.7 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  We recognized OFSE orders of $14.1 billion, $11.8 billion, and $12.3 billion and IET orders of $12.7 billion, $9.9 billion, and $8.4 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the remaining performance obligations totaled $27.8 billion and $23.6 billion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, OFSE remaining performance obligations totaled $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion, and IET remaining performance obligations totaled $25.3 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT We engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products, services, technology, and other solutions, as well as the improvement of existing products, services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs.  We continue to invest across both operating segments in products to enhance safety, develop capability, improve performance, and reduce costs aligned with our operational strategy.  Through our Technology Centers we also invest heavily in fundamental technologies such as materials, additive manufacturing, sensing, artificial intelligence/machine learning and other digital technologies such as computer vision, data science, and edge computing.

We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our IP rights.  Many patents and patent applications comprise the Baker Hughes portfolio and are owned by us.  Other patents and patent applications applicable to our products and services are licensed to us by GE and, in some cases, third parties.  In particular, we have an IP cross-license agreement with GE that allows both parties to have continued and permanent rights to commercially utilize certain IP of the other pursuant to the terms of the agreement.  The IP cross-licenses remain in place following GE exiting its ownership position in us.  We do not consider any individual patent to be material to our business operations. We follow a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance.  We believe that maintenance, protection and enforcement of our patents, trademarks, and related IP rights is central to the conduct of our business, and aggressively pursue protection of our IP rights against infringement, misappropriation, or other violation worldwide as may be necessary to protect our business.  Additionally, we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers, and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete.  SEASONALITY Our operations can be affected by seasonal events, which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services, and our customers' budgetary cycles.  Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below: \u2022Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail coastal and offshore drilling, which may impact our operations or our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured.  Other adverse weather conditions could include extreme heat in the Middle East during the summer months which may impact our operations or our customers' operations. \u2022The severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in North America can have an impact on activity levels and produce variability throughout the year. \u2022Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers\u2019 operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue. \u2022Many of our international OFSE customers may increase activity for certain products and services in the fourth quarter as they seek to fully utilize their annual budgets. \u2022Our broader IET businesses typically experience higher customer activity as a result of spending patterns in the second half of the year.  RAW MATERIALS We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services.\u00a0 The principal raw materials we use include steel alloys, chromium, nickel, titanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components, and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks.\u00a0 Raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources, but may be subject to price volatility.\u00a0 Due to COVID-19 and other macro-economic factors, the availability of electronic components has resulted in additional expediting activities, fulfillment challenges, and in some cases price increases.  We have also seen price increases for ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other raw materials.  Our procurement teams utilize advanced planning and may enter into strategic agreements with our global suppliers to minimize price impacts and other availability challenges.  We anticipate some pricing and fulfillment volatility for certain raw materials, components and certain logistics lanes to continue through 2023. Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 7 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 7 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 7   In addition to raw materials and component parts, we also use the products and services of metal fabricators, machine shops, foundries, forge shops, assembly operations, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, packagers, indirect material providers, and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers.  These materials and services are generally available from multiple sources.  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (\"ESG\") Environmental We believe we have an important role to play in society as an industry leader and partner.\u00a0 We view ESG as a key lever to transform the performance of our Company and our industry.  In 2019, we made a commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.  This goal encompasses emissions from our direct operations (\"Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions\") in alignment with the Paris Agreement and the specific recommendations of the United Nations (\"UN\") Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5oC. We continue to make progress on emissions reductions.  We reported in our 2021 Corporate Responsibility report a 23% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions compared to our 2019 base year.  This reduction was primarily due to executing on our net-zero roadmap and the key decarbonization pathways through a combination of energy efficiency initiatives, facility consolidation, increasing electric power consumption from renewable energy sources, and improvements in our vehicle fleet, among other reasons.  We will continue to employ a broad range of emissions reduction initiatives across manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, energy sourcing, and generation.  We also continue efforts to reduce our overall environmental footprint by using materials wisely and preserving land, water, and air quality.  Our sustainability commitments include our formal participation in the UN Global Compact (\"UNGC\") and our commitment to the Ten Principles including human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, as well as the UNGC's Sustainable Development Goals.  We have annually renewed our commitment to the UN Global Compact since joining in 2019. Social & Human Capital At Baker Hughes, our people are central contributors to our purpose of taking energy forward.

We have conducted training on unconscious bias and launched pilot projects on blind resumes and debiasing job descriptions, interview templates, and assessments as well as expanded our talent acquisition focus to include executive search services. Employee Resource Groups (\"ERG\"): ERGs consist of employees who have joined together based on shared interests, characteristics, or life experiences.  These groups can have a powerful influence on driving change by elevating the conversation and awareness around key issues and engaging with the communities where we operate.  In 2022, we further expanded our support of the ERGs in several ways, including the opportunity for ERGs to nominate charitable organizations to receive grants from the Baker Hughes Foundation.  These efforts have helped our DEI focus and fostered closer connections between employees in communities around the world. Inclusive Culture: We have several programs and initiatives that cultivate an inclusive culture.  The Baker Hughes Global DEI Council, comprised of executives representing our businesses, functions and regions, supports the success of our DEI mission and meets quarterly to review progress and discuss ways in which to continue to advance our efforts.  The DEI Community of Practice facilitates sharing best practices across the enterprise.  We provide our workforce with tools, resources, and learning opportunities that raise awareness, foster inclusive behaviors, and build cross-cultural competences. Compensation and Benefits We are committed to paying for performance and supporting our employees\u2019 wellbeing, as well as the wellbeing of their families, by offering flexible and competitive benefits tailored by location to meet the specific needs of our employees.  We regularly assess our total compensation and benefits programs through regular benchmarking with industry peers and local markets.  We strive to ensure that our compensation programs are fair and equitable for all employees.  Healthcare plans and life insurance are a core benefit of the Company and are provided in most locations.  Baker Hughes offers various leaves of absence options for certain quality-of-life needs, including family care.  We also continue to assess and provide programs that support our employees' work arrangements such as flexible schedules, compressed work weeks, hybrid work, remote work, and other options. Learning and Development Learning and Development is a personal journey at Baker Hughes.  We empower our employees to follow their passion for personal knowledge, job related skills, development, and the domain expertise needed for professional and personal growth.  In alignment with this, in 2022, we added CORE Strengths and Journey courses to our learning communities catalog for our employees to learn, share and practice with their peers no matter where they are in their career.  CORE Strengths adds focus to the critical skills (for example Data Analytics, Project Management, Change Management) that will help transform our organization, and Journey is targeted for our promoted leaders to help them transition to their newly expanded role.  Also in 2022, we started offering in-person learning opportunities to compliment the robust virtual learning catalog with workshops, team development, and flagships.  In 2021, we launched the community, CORE Values, which is a curated learning space centered around our Baker Hughes Values: Grow, Care, Collaborate & Lead, and the behaviors associated with each value.  Each learning community involves e-learning, virtual workshops, and allows participants to lead their own sessions. Our formal leadership development programs play a pivotal role in attracting, retaining, and developing talent and increasing the pipeline of diverse talent into and within the organization.  As an example, Aspire is a two-year rotational leadership program for recent graduates and early-career employees to grow functional and leadership skills through challenging assignments, learning plans, and global cross-functional projects. Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 9 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 9 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 9   Health, Safety, Environment, and Wellness Health and safety is at the core of our culture as we are committed to doing the right thing to protect our employees, customers, the communities where we live and work, and the environment.  We take a risk-based approach with proactive and preventive programs to deliver safe, secure, and sustainable operations.  We have established a stringent set of standards which meet or exceed global regulatory requirements. Our commitment to HSE starts at the highest levels of our Company and is embedded throughout all layers of the organization.  We encourage and empower all employees to take an active role in \"owning\" HSE by stopping work when conditions are unsafe and reporting observations, near misses, and stop-work events through open reporting channels.  Our teams are required to complete recurring training.  We offer more than 230 unique HSE courses including foundational training required for all employees, workplace and job-specific training, and human-performance leadership training for managers.  Our ambition is to make every day a Perfect HSE Day\u2014one without serious injuries, accidents, or harm to the environment.  In 2022, we achieved 217 Perfect HSE Days, up 6% versus 2021. Our commitment to HSE goes beyond safety alone.  Occupational health and wellness is a key competency jointly managed within our HSE and HR centers of excellence.  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken prudent steps as a company to reduce the risk and spread of the virus.  Our top priorities have remained: protecting our employees, maintaining operations, and supporting customers and communities globally.  As conditions improved in certain places, we started bringing more employees back to offices and worksites and enabled opportunities for more in-person engagements where it was safe to do so.  We continue to monitor the situation and will adapt our protocols as needed to protect our employees and deliver for our customers, in alignment with all associated requirements. The importance of physical health, ergonomics, preventative health care, and mental wellness cannot be overstated in promoting a healthy, engaged, and productive workplace.  We work with our health benefit providers and internal teams to offer employees health and wellness programs, telemedicine access, health screenings, immunizations, fitness reimbursements, and virtual wellness tools. In 2022, the mental health and emotional well-being of our employees continued to be a critical priority.  We hosted numerous events with Baker Hughes leaders and external experts, further embedded mental well-being into leadership engagements, and provided resources and tools to employees.  Our Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\") helps employees navigate daily life to manage remote work, cope with major life events or deal with a global pandemic.  The EAP gives employees and their family members direct access to professional coaches for in-the-moment counseling or referrals to community experts and extended care providers. Community Involvement Baker Hughes seeks to make a positive impact in the communities where we conduct business around the world.  Consistent with our purpose and values, we work to advance environmental quality, educational opportunities, health, and wellness.  We benefit our communities through financial contributions, in-kind donations of goods and services, and volunteer projects.  The Baker Hughes Foundation makes strategic philanthropic contributions, matches Baker Hughes employee charitable contributions, and awards volunteer recognition grants for outstanding employee community service. Governance The Company\u2019s Board of Directors (\"the Board\") believes the purpose of corporate governance is to maximize shareholder value in a manner consistent with legal requirements and the highest standards of integrity.  The Board has adopted and adheres to corporate governance practices, which the Board and management believe promote this purpose, are sound, and represent best practices.  The Board periodically reviews these governance practices, Delaware law (the state in which the Company is incorporated), the rules and listing standards of Nasdaq and SEC regulations, as well as best practices suggested by recognized governance authorities. Our Board monitors and provides oversight over our ESG policies, programs, and practices regarding corporate responsibility and sustainability and plays an active role in overseeing our human capital management efforts.  Our Human Capital and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our social strategy, policies, programs, and  Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 10 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 10 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 10   initiatives focusing on DEI as well as pay equity, culture, talent development, succession planning, and executive compensation and benefits.  Our Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee provides oversight of the Company's environmental matters, including monitoring its sustainability strategy and initiatives and the management of employee health, safety, and wellness matters.  The Audit Committee provides oversight over the Company\u2019s risk assessment and risk management policies and processes, including data privacy, ethics, and compliance reporting.  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION Environmental Matters We are committed to the health and safety of people, protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws, regulations and our policies.  Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international regulations concerning, among other things, air and water quality, waste management, and land protection.  Environmental regulations continue to evolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment of new legislation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation.  Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly. While we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business, we are, and may in the future be, involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties, typically related to historical operations.  On rare occasions, our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order.  Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations.  For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted.  We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such amounts can be reasonably estimated.  Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation.  Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred. The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (known as \"Superfund\") imposes liability for the release of a \"hazardous substance\" into the environment.  Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault, even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations.  We have been identified as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") at various Superfund sites, and we accrue our share, if known, of the estimated remediation costs for the site.  PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs. In some cases, it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage, or superfund allocation information is not yet available.  Based upon current information, we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations, including remediation obligations, environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost, based on available information, is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  Our total accrual for environmental remediation was $63 million and $67 million at December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  We continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate Company standards and by improving our environmental assurance programs. Other Regulatory Matters We are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which our products are manufactured or sold.  Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, classification, labeling, safety, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, advertising, and marketing of our products.  Additionally, as a U.S. entity operating through subsidiaries in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the import and export of goods as well as the flow of funds between us and our subsidiaries.  In particular, the shipment of goods, services and technology  Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 11 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 11 Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 11   across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations.  Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate.  Pursuant to their laws and regulations, governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions.  We are also required to be in compliance with transfer pricing, securities laws, and other statutes and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and other countries\u2019 anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes. As a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February of 2022, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom, European Union (\"EU\"), and other countries enacted sanctions against Russia and certain Russian interests.  As previously announced on March 19, 2022, we suspended any new investments in our Russia operations, but continued to comply with applicable laws and regulations as we fulfilled current contractual obligations.  Over the course of the second quarter of 2022, we closely monitored the developments in Ukraine and Russia and changes to sanctions all of which continued to make ongoing operations increasingly complex and significantly more challenging.  As a result, we completed a number of actions during the course of 2022 including the sale of part of our OFSE Russia business and suspended substantially all of our remaining operational activities in Russia.  For further information see \"Note 20. Restructuring, Impairment and Other\" and \"Note 21. Business Dispositions and Acquisitions\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein. We are also subject to laws relating to data privacy and security and consumer credit, protection and fraud.  An increasing number of governments worldwide have established laws and regulations, and industry groups also have promoted various standards, regarding data privacy and security, including with respect to the protection and processing of personal data.  The legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.  We are also subject to labor and employment laws, including regulations established by the U.S. Department of Labor and other local regulatory agencies, which sets laws governing working conditions, paid leave, workplace safety, wage and hour standards, and hiring and employment practices. While there are no current regulatory matters that we expect to be material to our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, there can be no assurances that existing or future environmental laws and other laws, regulations and standards applicable to our operations or products will not lead to a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
