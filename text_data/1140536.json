ITEM 1. BUSINESS  The Company WTW is a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that provides data-driven, insight-led solutions in the areas of people, risk and capital. Utilizing the global view and local expertise of our more than 46,000 colleagues serving more than 140 countries and markets, we help organizations sharpen strategies, enhance resilience, motivate workforces and maximize performance. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. Working closely with our clients, we uncover opportunities for sustainable success. Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from large, major multinational corporations to middle-market domestic and international companies. Our clients include many of the world\u2019s leading corporations, including approximately 93% of the FTSE 100, 89% of the Fortune 1000, and 90% of the Fortune Global 500 companies. We also advise the majority of the world\u2019s leading insurance companies. We work with major corporations, emerging growth companies, governmental agencies and not-for-profit institutions in a wide variety of industries, with many of our client relationships spanning decades. None of the Company\u2019s customers individually represented more than 10% of its consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We place insurance with more than 2,500 insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for a significant concentration of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2022, 2021 or 2020. Segment Reorganization On January 1, 2022, WTW realigned to provide its comprehensive offering of services and solutions to clients across two business segments: Health, Wealth & Career and Risk & Broking. These changes were made in conjunction with changes in the WTW leadership team, including the appointment of a new chief executive officer who succeeded the prior CEO as the chief operating decision maker on that date. Prior to January 1, 2022, we operated across four segments: Human Capital and Benefits; Corporate Risk and Broking; Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; and Benefits Delivery and Administration. Following the realignment, the two new segments consist of the following businesses: \u2022The Health, Wealth & Career segment includes businesses previously aligned under the Human Capital and Benefits segment, the Benefits Delivery and Administration segment, and the Investments business, which was previously under the Investment, Risk and Reinsurance segment.  The Health, Wealth & Career segment includes businesses previously aligned under the Human Capital and Benefits segment, the Benefits Delivery and Administration segment, and the Investments business, which was previously under the Investment, Risk and Reinsurance segment.  \u2022The Risk & Broking segment includes businesses previously aligned under the Corporate Risk and Broking segment, as well as the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, which was previously under the Investment, Risk and Reinsurance segment. The Risk & Broking segment includes businesses previously aligned under the Corporate Risk and Broking segment, as well as the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, which was previously under the Investment, Risk and Reinsurance segment. Below are the percentages of revenue generated by each segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. These percentages exclude revenue that has been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Year ended December 31, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 2021 \u00a0 \u00a0 2020 \u00a0 Health, Wealth & Career \u00a0 \u00a0 60 % \u00a0 \u00a0 60 % \u00a0 \u00a0 60 % Risk & Broking \u00a0 \u00a0 40 % \u00a0 \u00a0 40 % \u00a0 \u00a0 40 % The following presents descriptions of our reorganized segments:  Health, Wealth & Career The Health, Wealth & Career (\u2018HWC\u2019) segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and technology for employee benefit plans, institutional investors, compensation and career programs, and the employee experience overall. Our portfolio of services support the interrelated challenges that the management teams of our clients face across human resources (\u2018HR\u2019) and finance.  HWC is the larger of the two segments of the Company. Addressing four key areas, Health, Wealth, Career and Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing, the segment is focused on addressing our clients\u2019 people and risk needs to help them succeed in a global marketplace. 3 \u00a0 Health The Health & Benefits (\u2018H&B\u2019) business provides strategy and design consulting, plan management service and support, broking and administration across the full spectrum of health, wellbeing and other group benefit programs, including medical, dental, disability, life, voluntary benefits and other coverage. Our reach extends from small/mid-market clients to large-market and multinational clients, across the full geographic footprint of the Company, and to most industries. We can address our clients\u2019 needs in more than 140 countries. Our consultants help clients make strategic decisions on topics such as optimizing program spend; evaluating emerging vendors, point solutions and coverage options (including publicly-subsidized health insurance exchanges and private exchanges in the U.S.); and dealing with above-inflation-rate increases in healthcare costs. We also assist clients in selecting the appropriate insurance carriers to cover benefit risks and administer the programs. In addition to our consulting and broking services, we manage a number of collective purchasing initiatives, such as pharmacy and stop-loss, that allow employers to realize greater value from third-party service providers than they can achieve on their own. With Global Benefits Management, our suite of global services supporting medical, dental and risk (e.g., life, disability) programs, we have a tailored offering for multinationals. This offering includes a flexible set of ready-made solutions, proven technology and an integrated approach to service delivery that translates to a globally consistent, high-quality experience for our clients. A meaningful portion of revenue in this business is from recurring work, though contracts may be annual or multi-year. Given the balance of revenue across consulting, broking and solutions, our revenue is somewhat weighted to the first quarter. Wealth Our wealth-related businesses include Retirement and Investments. The Retirement business provides actuarial support, plan design, and administrative services for all forms of pension and retirement savings plans. Our colleagues help our clients assess the costs and risks of retirement plans on cash flow, earnings and the balance sheet, the effects of changing workforce demographics on their retirement plans, and retiree benefit adequacy and security. We offer clients a full range of integrated retirement consulting services and solutions to meet the needs of all types of employers, including those that continue to offer defined benefit plans and those that are reexamining their retirement benefit strategies. We help multinationals coordinate plan design and actuarial services across their complex global plans. We bring in-depth data analysis and perspective to their decision process, because we have tracked the retirement designs and financing strategies of companies around the world over many decades. For clients that want to outsource some or all of their pension plan management, we offer broking services, as well as integrated solutions that can combine investment discretionary management, pension administration, core actuarial services, and communication and change management assistance. Retirement relationships are generally long-term in nature, and client retention rates for this business are high. A significant portion of the revenue in this business is from recurring work, with multi-year contracts that are driven by the heavily regulated nature of pension plans and our clients\u2019 annual needs for these services. Revenue for the Retirement business in some geographies is somewhat seasonal, as much of our work pertains to calendar-year plan administration, financing, reporting and compliance; thus, revenue is typically more weighted to the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year. Our Investments business provides advice and discretionary investment management solutions to defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as to a range of other client types including insurers, endowments and foundations, and private wealth investors. We provide a solution to a significant business problem faced by our clients, namely sustaining the resources and skills required to deliver a financial services product in highly competitive capital markets. We offer a flexible approach that adapts to a wide range of client needs and circumstances, with the objective of higher returns, lower risk and lower costs within each client\u2019s unique situation. Our solutions range from single asset class activity, through complete management of entire pension plan assets including sophisticated liability hedging programs. We bring together a broad array of specialist investment knowledge and skills across all asset classes, a high-quality execution platform, a cost advantage through our scale, and expert advisors with experience across all client types from the largest plans in the world to small corporate pension plans. We have long-term relationships with our Investments clients, with the majority of our revenue driven by retainer contracts. 4 \u00a0 Career Our career-related offerings include advice, data, software and products to address clients\u2019 total rewards and talent issues across the globe delivered through our Work & Rewards and Employee Experience businesses. Within our Work & Rewards business, we help clients determine the best ways to get work done, the skills needed for jobs, and how to reward it. We address executive compensation and broad-based rewards. We advise our clients\u2019 management and boards of directors on all aspects of executive pay programs, including base pay, annual bonuses, long-term incentives, perquisites and other benefits. Our focus is on aligning pay plans with an organization\u2019s business strategy and driving desired performance. Our solutions incorporate proprietary market benchmarking data and software to support compensation administration. Our Employee Experience business focuses on the provision of solutions including employee insight and listening tools, talent assessment tools and services, communication and change management services. Revenue for our career-related businesses is partly seasonal in nature, with heightened activity in the second half of the calendar year during the annual compensation, benefits, and survey cycles. While these businesses enjoy long-term relationships with many clients, work in several practices is often project-based and can be sensitive to economic changes. The businesses benefit from regulatory changes affecting our clients that require strategic advice, program changes and communication, as well as the focus on ESG as a component of executive and board pay, the redefinition of jobs, work location and career paths as technology disaggregates work, and the recalibration of pay and the employee experience amidst shifting labor markets. Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing Our Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing businesses include Benefits Delivery & Administration (\u2018BDA\u2019) and Technology and Administration Solutions (\u2018TAS\u2019). The BDA business provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets, primarily in the U.S. A significant portion of the revenue in this business is recurring in nature, driven by either the commissions from the policies we sell, or from long-term service contracts with our clients that typically range from three to five years. Revenue across this business is seasonal and is generally higher in the fourth quarter as it is driven when typical annual enrollment activity occurs. BDA provides services via two related offerings: Benefits Outsourcing is focused on serving active employee groups for clients across the U.S. Working closely with other HWC businesses, we use our proprietary technology to provide a suite of health and welfare and pension administration outsourcing services, including tools to enable benefit modeling, decision support, enrollment and benefit choice. Drawing on expertise in H&B and Retirement to create high-performing benefit plan designs, we believe we are well-positioned to help clients of all sizes simplify their benefits delivery, while lowering the total costs of benefits and related administration. Individual Marketplace offers decision support processes and tools to connect consumers with insurance carriers in private individual and Medicare markets. Individual Marketplace serves both employer-based and direct-to-consumer populations through its end-to-end consumer acquisition and engagement platforms, which tightly integrate call routing technology, an efficient quoting and enrollment engine, a customer relations management system and deep links with insurance carriers. By leveraging its multiple distribution channels and diverse product portfolio, Individual Marketplace offers solutions to a broad consumer base, helping individuals compare, purchase and use health insurance products, tools and information for life. Our TAS business provides pension outsourcing services to hundreds of clients across multiple industries. Our TAS team focuses on clients outside of the U.S. where our services are supported by high quality administration teams using robust technology platforms. Given the nature of the work, our revenue is distributed generally evenly across the year. With ongoing servicing requirements and multi-year contracts in place, we have high client retention rates. We are the leading administrator among the 200 largest pension plans in the U.K., as well as a leader in Germany. For both our defined benefit and defined contribution administration services, we use highly-automated processes and technology to enable benefit plan members to access and manage their records, perform self-service functions and improve their understanding of their benefits. Our technology also provides trustees and HR teams with timely management information to monitor activity and service levels and reduce administration costs. 5 \u00a0 Risk & Broking The Risk & Broking (\u2018R&B\u2019) segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations. The segment comprises two primary businesses: Corporate Risk & Broking (\u2018CRB\u2019) The \u2018CRB\u2019 business places more than $25 billion of premiums into the insurance markets on an annual basis, and delivers integrated global solutions tailored to client needs, underpinned by data and analytics through a balanced matrix of global lines of business across all of the Company\u2019s three geographical areas: North America, Europe (including Great Britain) and International.

Available Information The Company files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website that contains annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information that issuers (including WTW) file electronically with the SEC. The SEC\u2019s website is www.sec.gov. The Company makes available, free of charge through our website, www.wtwco.com, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our proxy statement, current reports on Form 8-K and Forms 3, 4, and 5 filed on behalf of directors and executive officers, as well as any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u2018Exchange Act\u2019) as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Unless specifically incorporated by reference, information on our website is not a part of this Form 10-K. The Company\u2019s Memorandum and Articles of Association, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Audit and Risk Committee Charter, Operational Transformation Committee Charter, Human Capital and Compensation Committee Charter, and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee Charter are available on our website, www.wtwco.com, in the Investor Relations section, or upon request. Requests for copies of these documents should be directed in writing to the Company Secretary c/o Office of General Counsel, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Brookfield Place, 200 Liberty Street, New York, NY 10281. General Information WTW offers its clients a broad range of services and solutions to help them to identify and control their risks, and to enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and engage a talented workforce. Our risk control services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis) to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting), as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and climate risk quantification). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We help our clients enhance their business performance by delivering consulting services, technology and solutions that help them anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management, as well as offer investment advice to help them develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals.

We operate a private Medicare exchange in the U.S. Through this exchange and those for active employees, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with healthcare benefits. We are not an insurance company, and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account. We derive the majority of our revenue from either commissions or fees for brokerage or consulting services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations. Our fees for consulting services are spread across a variety of complementary businesses that generally remain steady during times of uncertainty. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change. Risks and Uncertainties of the Economic Environment Beginning with the COVID-19 pandemic there have been adverse changes in global commercial activity, particularly in the global supply chain and workforce availability, and significant volatility in the global financial markets including, among other effects, occasional declines in the equity markets, changes in interest rates and reduced liquidity on a global basis.  Supply and labor market disruptions caused by COVID-19, accommodative monetary and fiscal policy and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have contributed to significant inflation in many of the markets in which we operate. This impacts not only the costs to attract and retain employees but also other costs to run and invest in our business. If our costs grow significantly in excess of our ability to raise revenue, our margins and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives.  Although we believe we have adapted to the unique challenges posed by COVID-19 surrounding how and where we do our work, we are also impacted by the negative effect on workforce availability, which could hamper our ability to grow our capacity on pace with  7 \u00a0 increasing demand for our services. We expect the market for talent to remain highly competitive for at least the next several months. We will continue to monitor the situation and assess any implications to our business and our stakeholders. Additional information about COVID-19 related risks is discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors \u2013 \u2018We have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and may be substantially and negatively impacted by COVID-19 or other pandemics in the future\u2019. Business Strategy  As discussed under Item 1, \u2018Business \u2013 The Company\u2019, we seek to be an advisory, broking and solutions provider of choice through an integrated global platform. WTW is in the business of people, risk and capital. We believe that a unified approach to these areas can be a path to growth for organizations around the world. We harness our collective power as \u2018One WTW\u2019 to make smart connections to serve and support our clients. We operate in attractive markets \u2013 both growing and mature \u2013 with a diversified platform across geographies, industries, segments and lines of business.  Our vision is to be the best advisory, broking and solutions company for the benefit of all our stakeholders \u2013 creating a competitive advantage and delivering sustainable, profitable growth. We believe we can achieve this through executing on our three strategic priorities \u2013 grow, simplify and transform: \u2022Grow at or above market in priority areas: Focus on core opportunities with the highest growth and return; innovate and accelerate our offerings through a dynamic, yet disciplined, approach; bring targeted solutions to clients reflecting more connected offerings; and increase scale to fill gaps in capabilities through inorganic expansion. Grow at or above market in priority areas: Focus on core opportunities with the highest growth and return; innovate and accelerate our offerings through a dynamic, yet disciplined, approach; bring targeted solutions to clients reflecting more connected offerings; and increase scale to fill gaps in capabilities through inorganic expansion. \u2022Simplify the business to increase agility and effectiveness: Implement the Company\u2019s streamlined structure of two business segments (Health, Wealth & Career and Risk & Broking; see \u2018Segment Reorganization\u2019 within this Item 1 for further information) and three geographies (Europe, International and North America); develop a globally consistent client management model and enhance operations to improve sales and retention outcomes; manage our portfolio of businesses intentionally to drive optimal value; and increase speed of execution through agile decision-making processes. Simplify the business to increase agility and effectiveness: Implement the Company\u2019s streamlined structure of two business segments (Health, Wealth & Career and Risk & Broking; see \u2018Segment Reorganization\u2019 within this Item 1 for further information) and three geographies (Europe, International and North America); develop a globally consistent client management model and enhance operations to improve sales and retention outcomes; manage our portfolio of businesses intentionally to drive optimal value; and increase speed of execution through agile decision-making processes. \u2022Transform operations to drive savings while enhancing our client and colleague experiences: Maximize global platforms to be as common as possible and as distinct as necessary; right-shore operations to capitalize on our scale; rationalize real estate and build new ways of working; and modernize technology to enhance the digital experience.  Transform operations to drive savings while enhancing our client and colleague experiences: Maximize global platforms to be as common as possible and as distinct as necessary; right-shore operations to capitalize on our scale; rationalize real estate and build new ways of working; and modernize technology to enhance the digital experience.  We care as much about how we work as we do about the impact that we make. This means commitment to a shared purpose and values, a framework that guides how we run our business and serve clients. Through these strategies we aim to accelerate revenue, margin improvement, cash flow, EBITDA, and earnings growth, and to generate compelling returns for investors, by delivering tangible growth in revenue. For more information about risks to our strategic plans, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Human Capital  Colleague experience \u2013 Our colleague experience is an important differentiating factor for WTW.  It is designed to provide colleagues with a strong sense of purpose and belonging where everyone is heard and valued, the opportunity to build great connections with people and leaders, meaningful and interesting work, and opportunities to grow and thrive with recognition and reward in return. This means we strive to foster an inclusive environment where everyone can be their authentic self, where we encourage curiosity, innovation and a continuous improvement mindset and an environment where we are bold in our thinking and care about the impact we have. Our values, vision, purpose, and new Colleague Value Proposition (\u2018CVP\u2019) - we\u2019re Authentic, Curious and Bold, set the tone for what to expect at WTW. In addition, our \u2018grow, simplify and transform\u2019 strategic priorities enhance our focus on how to continually support and improve, as appropriate, our colleague experience. We evaluate rewards offerings, system upgrades and process efficiencies as well as the tradeoffs that may be required. We continually explore how we can work with flexibility in an on-going hybrid model, and fuel innovation, among other things, to attract, engage and retain the most accomplished and aspiring talent. 8 \u00a0 Headcount \u2013 Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate the most accomplished and aspiring talent in the industry. The number of employees by segment as of the year ended December 31, 2022 is approximated below: \u00a0 \u00a0 December 31, 2022 \u00a0 Health, Wealth & Career \u00a0 \u00a0 24,000 \u00a0 Risk & Broking \u00a0 \u00a0 14,000 \u00a0 Corporate and Other \u00a0 \u00a0 8,600 \u00a0 Total Employees \u00a0 \u00a0 46,600 \u00a0 The number of employees by geography as of the year ended December 31, 2022 is approximated below: \u00a0 \u00a0 December 31, 2022 \u00a0 North America \u00a0 \u00a0 15,900 \u00a0 Europe \u00a0 \u00a0 15,000 \u00a0 International \u00a0 \u00a0 15,700 \u00a0 Total Employees \u00a0 \u00a0 46,600 \u00a0 Voluntary turnover excluding seasonal employees (rolling 12-month attrition) has stabilized in 2022 (15.2%) compared to 2021 (15.2%). Pre-Covid-19 attrition typically averaged around 12.0% and we have seen voluntary turnover begin to decline in the latter part of 2022.  Hiring \u2013 Hiring in 2022 increased significantly as the business stabilized, demand for our services increased and we returned to our historical experience as an employer of choice. Hiring and internal movement statistics, summarized below, consistent with prior years excludes seasonal colleagues in Tranzact and Individual Marketplace as the volumes are material and fluctuate significantly:  \u2022Hires increased 34% over 2021 to over 9,700. Hiring growth was strong across all segments and geographies. At year-end, there were approximately 2,400 open positions, which is higher than historic rates but reflective of the sharp increase in new positions opened in the second half of the year, partly attributable to transformation hiring. Hires increased 34% over 2021 to over 9,700. Hiring growth was strong across all segments and geographies. At year-end, there were approximately 2,400 open positions, which is higher than historic rates but reflective of the sharp increase in new positions opened in the second half of the year, partly attributable to transformation hiring. \u2022During 2022, 14.7% of open positions were filled with internal candidates compared to 13.9% in 2021. Promotions (changes in levels) and direct appointments into new roles brought additional opportunities for career growth and advancement.

Rehires represented 11.8% of total hires in 2022 (5% excluding seasonal colleagues). Inclusion and Diversity (\u2018I&D\u2019) \u2013 We believe that when our individual talents are combined, we unlock our collective potential. We further believe that we are better together because each of us is different. WTW aims to ensure that our values and I&D commitments are reflected in every interaction. To support this, we\u2019re focusing on three key areas: \u2022Attract and hire to grow our talent pipeline of colleagues from underrepresented communities. Attract and hire to grow our talent pipeline of colleagues from underrepresented communities. \u2022Develop and promote to increase the overall diversity in business leadership. Develop and promote to increase the overall diversity in business leadership. \u2022Promote an inclusive culture that respects each other\u2019s differences and celebrates what\u2019s unique about each of us. Promote an inclusive culture that respects each other\u2019s differences and celebrates what\u2019s unique about each of us. A key underlying theme of these priorities is a sharpened focus on our female talent and our aim to increase overall diversity in leadership levels and throughout our talent pipeline.  At December 31, 2022, we had the following global female representation, and in the U.S. where we have the most complete data, we had the following ethnic and racial diversity representation: \u00a0 Colleague Group All Colleagues \u00a0 Senior Leadership (ii) Female (global) 55.1% \u00a0 31.0% Ethnic and racial diversity (U.S. only) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Asian 7.3% \u00a0 4.9% Black 11.8% \u00a0 1.2% Hispanic 6.3% \u00a0 2.0% Other non-white (i) 2.3% \u00a0 0.6% Total 27.7% \u00a0 8.7% \u00a0 (i)Other non-white includes American Indian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and two or more races. Other non-white includes American Indian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and two or more races. (ii)Senior leadership represents about 5% of our colleagues and includes those with titles of Managing and Senior Directors. Senior leadership represents about 5% of our colleagues and includes those with titles of Managing and Senior Directors. 9 \u00a0 The current board is 44% female, including the Human Capital and Compensation Committee Chair. Our board also has representation from the LGBT+ and Black communities, and includes members with non-U.S. citizenship, including the Audit and Risk Committee Chair. Additionally, effective April 1, 2023, three new independent directors will join the board. Further, two current directors will not be standing for re-election at the Company\u2019s 2023 Annual General Meeting. Assuming all of the Company\u2019s nominees are elected and have joined the board, the board\u2019s composition as of the conclusion of the 2023 Annual General Meeting will then be 40% female and will continue to include representation from the LGBT+ and Black communities as well as directors with non-U.S. citizenship. Our executive officers have I&D objectives as part of their individual performance component, comprising a portion of their short-term incentive awards. Each year our leaders cascade I&D objectives throughout the organization, and we continue to reinforce objective and fair processes that mitigate bias in all our talent programs and processes. Examples of key activities include: \u2022Our global I&D council, sponsored by our CEO and CHRO, sets the standard for our I&D initiatives globally. It is driven by regional councils that provide local perspectives and help to translate our global priorities into actions within each region. Our global I&D council, sponsored by our CEO and CHRO, sets the standard for our I&D initiatives globally.

We have I&D processes in place that are intended to ensure outcomes represent our values and progress our diversity goals. \u2022Our inclusion networks are designed to engage our talent and better connect us to each other, our clients and the communities in which we work and live. Current inclusion networks include: Gender Equity, LGBT+, Multicultural, Workability (Asia, North America, the U.K.) and Young Professionals (Asia, the U.K., Western Europe). Our inclusion networks are designed to engage our talent and better connect us to each other, our clients and the communities in which we work and live. Current inclusion networks include: Gender Equity, LGBT+, Multicultural, Workability (Asia, North America, the U.K.) and Young Professionals (Asia, the U.K., Western Europe). Total rewards \u2013 We invest significant resources in our most important asset, our colleagues. We generally seek to offer market competitive rewards packages comprising of a mix of base salary and incentives aligned to our pay-for-performance philosophy plus benefits that support health and wellbeing as well as the ability to plan for the future. In 2022, WTW commenced a companywide review of total rewards, encompassing compensation, benefit offerings and lifestyle support. It entails an assessment of data attained through surveys, interviews, focus groups and external benchmarking.  Our total rewards programs align to our commitment to colleague health and wellbeing, ensuring our colleagues are protected in the event of accident or illness, have sufficient paid time off and can accumulate capital for personal needs and retirement. Work Styles \u2013 In the past few years, we have adapted the way we work, enabling colleagues to work across a wide variety of different environments. In 2022 we officially launched WTW Work Styles, our approach to recognizing that there are many different approaches to work, which includes three distinct colleague working solutions; office-based, hybrid and remote. This new framework has flexibility at its core, and it\u2019s based on the idea that the work itself drives where and how the work gets done. As we grow, simplify, and transform WTW, this cultural shift is a differentiator for us in the market and is an important part of our ongoing strategy to attract and retain top talent. The failure to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects. For more information see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Competition  We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on factors including global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with companies such as Accenture plc, Aon plc, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Brown & Brown Inc., Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (\u2018Marsh & McLennan\u2019) and Robert Half International Inc., as well as with numerous specialty, regional and local firms. Competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market, and in some business lines Marsh & McLennan and Aon plc and other competitors have greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance. Additional competitive pressures have arisen and are expected to continue to arise from the entry and expansion of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms, new brokers and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services. The human capital and risk management consulting industries are highly competitive. We believe we have developed competitive advantages in providing HR consulting and risk management consulting services. We face strong competition from numerous sources, including from large consulting firms, accounting firms and specialized firms focused on these services as further identified below. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors \u2013 \u2018Demand for our services could decrease for various reasons, including a general economic  10 \u00a0 downturn, increased competition, or a decline in a client\u2019s or an industry\u2019s financial condition or prospects, all of which could substantially and negatively affect us\u2019, for a description of competition-related risks that may affect demand for the Company\u2019s services. Our largest competitors in the pension consulting industry are Mercer HR Consulting (a Marsh & McLennan company) and Aon plc. In addition, we face vigorous competition from numerous other companies in the global HR consulting industry. Our major competitors in the insurance consulting and software industry include Milliman, Oliver Wyman (a Marsh & McLennan company), the big four accounting firms (Deloitte LLP, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and KPMG), and SunGard. Aon plc, Buck Consultants (an HIG Capital Company), Connextions (a United Healthcare company) and Mercer (a Marsh & McLennan company). Automatic Data Processing and Fidelity are among our largest competitors in the insurance exchange industry. With the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we also compete with the public exchanges currently run by the U.S. federal, and state governments. We also compete with providers of account-based health plans and consumer-directed benefits such as WageWorks and HealthEquity. The market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. Regulatory and legislative actions, along with continuously evolving technological developments, will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors \u2013 \u2018Our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government laws or regulations, or if government laws or regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs\u2019 and related risk factors for a description of legal, non-financial regulatory, and compliance risks to the Company. We believe the primary factors in selecting an HR consulting or risk management services firm include reputation; the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment; geographic scope; quality of service; and the ability to tailor services to clients\u2019 unique needs. With regard to the marketplace for individuals and active employee exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings, a strong reputation for efficient execution, a provider\u2019s capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments, and an innovative service delivery model and platform. For our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products, we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. Regulation  Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in all countries in which we operate. Also, such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities. While these requirements may vary from location to location, they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information, as well as financial criteria. We are also subject to data privacy regulations that apply to health, medical, financial and other types of personal information belonging to our employees, clients and their employees and other third parties across most jurisdictions, including, among others, the E.U. and U.K. General Data Protection Regulations, the Personal Information Protection Law (\u2018PIPL\u2019) in China and privacy legislation in certain U.S. states. Our most significant regulatory regions are further described below: United States Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the U.S. are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the states in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these states. Additionally, some of our private exchange activities, including our TRANZACT business which focuses on direct-to-consumer Medicare policy sales, are overseen by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. Furthermore, certain of our activities are subject to regulation under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u2018HIPAA\u2019), which is enforced by the Office for Civil Rights within the Department of Health and Human Services. As we implement and expand our direct-to-consumer sales and marketing solutions through our Benefits Delivery & Administration business, we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations that prescribe when and how we may market to consumers  11 \u00a0 (including, without limitation, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and other telemarketing laws and the Medicare Communications and Marketing Guidelines issued by the Center for Medicare Services). Certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment and securities licensing authorities. Our activities in connection with investment services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision at both the federal and state levels. At the federal level, certain of our operating subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC through the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers\u2019 Act of 1940 and by the Department of Labor through the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. In connection with the SEC regulations, we are required to file certain reports, and are subject to various marketing restrictions, among other requirements. In connection with ERISA regulations, we are limited in the actions we can take for plans for which we serve as fiduciaries, among other matters. Our U.S. investment activities are also subject to certain state regulatory schemes, and some activities also are subject to regulation by the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission under the Commodities Exchange Act. Our activities in connection with Third Party Administrator (\u2018TPA\u2019) services in the United States are also subject to regulation and supervision by many state authorities.  Licensing requirements and supervision vary from state to state. As with insurance brokerage services, our continuing ability to provide these services in states that regulate our activities is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these states. United Kingdom In the U.K., our business is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (\u2018FCA\u2019). The FCA has a sole strategic objective: to ensure that the relevant markets function well. Its operational objectives are to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers, to protect and enhance the integrity of the U.K. financial system, and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers. The FCA has a wide range of rule-making, investigatory and enforcement powers (including the power to censure and fine) and conducts monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements.  In addition, the FCA extended the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (\u2018SMCR\u2019) which became effective on December 9, 2019 in relation to our U.K. FCA-regulated businesses. The SMCR is designed to drive improvements in culture and governance within financial services firms and to deter misconduct by increasing individual accountability to the FCA. New regulations and modifications to existing regulations that are specific to the U.K. have and will continue to result in differences from the regulatory requirements of the E.U. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, for a description of Brexit-related risks to the Company. Furthermore, as a result of Brexit, the WTW Brexit broking solution (the U.K. Branch of Willis Towers Watson SA/NV) has been required to seek authorization from the FCA as a third country branch. This application for full authorization was submitted in March 2022 and we are currently awaiting approval from the FCA. This will result in an increase in FCA supervision in the future with additional requirements for the branch in key areas such as SMCR. European Union In 2005, the European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the E.U. on a basis consistent with the E.U. single market and customer protection aims. Each E.U. member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence, good repute, professional indemnity cover and financial capacity. The E.U. issued an additional Insurance Distribution Directive that expands the 2005 directive, and all E.U. member states in which we operate were required to enact the directive and adopt local country laws by October 1, 2018. The \u2018Whistleblower Protection Directive\u2019, on the protection of persons who report breaches of E.U. law, entered into force on December 16, 2019 (Directive 2019/1937). This Directive includes reporting procedures for these persons. The new rules will require the creation of safe channels for reporting both within an organization - private or public - and to public authorities. They will also provide protection to whistleblowers against retaliation. Other Certain of our entities that undertake pension scheme management are subject to MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and MiFIR (the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation). In addition, revisions to MiFID (\u2018MiFID II\u2019) took effect in January 2018. These revisions are aimed at strengthening investor protection and improving the function of financial markets. MiFID II imposes a variety of requirements that include, among others, rules relating to product governance and independent investment advice, responsibility of management bodies, inducements, information and reporting to clients, cross-selling, remuneration of staff, and best  12 \u00a0 execution of trades for clients. Further, some of our entities are also authorized and regulated by certain financial services authorities in countries such as Sweden, Ireland, the Netherlands and the U.K. All companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the U.S. and U.K. We do not consider these regulatory requirements as adversely affecting our competitive position. Across many jurisdictions we are subject to various financial crime laws and regulations through our activities, activities of associated persons, the products and services we provide and our business and client relationships. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other areas, sanctions and export control, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorist financing. Our failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulatory compliance requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities, can result in disciplinary action, fines, reputational damage and financial harm. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, for an analysis of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation as well as compliance with evolving laws, including with respect to data privacy, cybersecurity, and Brexit, in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.
