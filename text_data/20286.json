{"cik": 20286, "item_1A": "ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business   Cincinnati Financial Corporation \u2013 Introduction We are an Ohio corporation formed in 1968. Our lead subsidiary, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, was founded in 1950. Our main business is property casualty insurance marketed through independent insurance agencies in 46\u00a0states. Our headquarters is in Fairfield, Ohio. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation owns 100% of four subsidiaries: The Cincinnati Insurance Company (Cincinnati Insurance), Cincinnati Global Underwriting Ltd.SM (Cincinnati Global), CSU\u00a0Producer Resources Inc. and CFC Investment Company. In\u00a0addition, the parent company has an investment portfolio, owns the headquarters property and is responsible for corporate borrowings and shareholder dividends.  \u00a0 The Cincinnati Insurance Company owns 100% of four additional insurance subsidiaries. Our standard market property casualty insurance group includes two of those subsidiaries \u2013 The Cincinnati Casualty Company and The\u00a0Cincinnati Indemnity Company. This group writes a broad range of business, homeowner and auto policies. The\u00a0Cincinnati Insurance Company also conducts the business of our reinsurance assumed operations, known as Cincinnati Re\u00ae. Other subsidiaries of The\u00a0Cincinnati Insurance Company include: The\u00a0Cincinnati Life Insurance Company (Cincinnati Life), which provides life insurance policies and fixed annuities; and The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company (Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters), which offers excess and surplus lines insurance products. In this report and elsewhere we often refer to any or all of these five companies as The\u00a0Cincinnati Insurance Companies. \u00a0 Cincinnati Global owns 100% of Cincinnati Global Underwriting Agency Ltd.SM, a London-based, global specialty underwriter for Lloyd's Syndicate 318, and Cincinnati Global Dedicated No. 2 Ltd.SM, a Lloyd\u2019s corporate member and vehicle through which capital is provided by Cincinnati Financial Corporation and third-party names at Lloyd\u2019s.   The two noninsurance subsidiaries of Cincinnati Financial Corporation are CSU Producer Resources, which offers insurance brokerage services to our independent agencies so their clients can access our excess and surplus lines insurance products; and CFC Investment Company, which offers commercial leasing and financing services to our agencies, their clients and other customers. \u00a0 Our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available on our website,  cinfin.com/investors, as soon as possible after they have been filed with the SEC. Reports filed with the SEC may also be viewed at sec.gov. These filings include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and exhibits and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In\u00a0this report we reference various websites. These websites, including our own, are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \u00a0 Periodically, we refer to estimated industry data so that we can give information about our performance versus the overall U.S. insurance industry. Unless otherwise noted, the industry data is prepared by A.M.\u00a0Best, a leading insurance industry statistical, analytical and insurer financial strength and credit rating organization. Information from A.M. Best is presented on a statutory accounting basis for insurance company regulation in the United States of America. When we provide our results on a comparable statutory accounting basis, we label it as such; all other company data\u00a0is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 5 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 5 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 5    Our Business and Our Strategy   Introduction The Cincinnati Insurance Company was founded more than 70 years ago by four independent insurance agents. They\u00a0established the mission that continues to guide all of the companies in the Cincinnati Financial Corporation family \u2013 to grow profitably and enhance the ability of local independent insurance agents to deliver quality financial protection to the people and businesses they serve by: \u2022providing insurance market stability through financial strength \u2022producing competitive, up-to-date products and services \u2022developing associates committed to superior service  At year-end 2022, a select group of independent agencies in 46 states actively marketed our property casualty insurance within their communities. Standard market commercial lines and excess and surplus lines policies were marketed in 42 of those states. Personal lines policies were marketed in 45 of those states. Within our select group of agencies, we also seek to become the life insurance carrier of choice and to help agents and their clients \u2013 our policyholders \u2013 by offering leasing and financing services. \u00a0 Three competitive advantages distinguish our company, positioning us to build shareholder value and to be successful overall: \u2022Commitment to our professional independent insurance agencies and to their continued\u00a0success \u2022Financial strength to fulfill our promises and be a consistent market for our agents\u2019 business, supporting stability and\u00a0confidence \u2022Operating structure that supports local decision making, showcasing our claims excellence and allowing us to balance growth with underwriting discipline  Management and our board of directors has developed an agency-focused strategy that we believe positions our company for long-term success and value creation, while managing difficult economic, market or pricing cycles. We\u00a0broadly group our key strategic initiatives into two areas of focus \u2013 managing insurance profitability and driving premium growth, as summarized below. Our strategic priorities include meeting the wants and needs of our agent customers, attracting and developing talented associates, achieving best-in-class field service and continually enhancing operational efficiency and effectiveness. To help guide our strategic efforts, we have placed an emphasis on innovation to accelerate operational improvement and to also favorably position us for the future. We find innovative ideas in many places, including: internally through management and other associates, with our traditional business partners and in the start-up business community.   \u2022Manage insurance profitability \u2013 Implementation of these initiatives is intended to enhance underwriting expertise and knowledge, thereby increasing our ability to manage our business while also gaining efficiency. Better profit margins may be achieved with additional information and expanded pricing capabilities we can access with the use of technology and analytics. This includes segmentation efforts that emphasize identification and retention of insurance policies we believe have relatively stronger pricing, while seeking more aggressive renewal terms and conditions on policies we believe have relatively weaker pricing. Pricing property casualty insurance policies includes estimates for expected losses, loss expenses to settle claims and expenses from underwriting policies while also considering the time value of money related to expected cash flows and a reasonable profit margin. In\u00a0addition to enhancing company efficiency and more quickly deploying product or service enhancements, improving internal processes also supports the ability of the independent agencies that represent us to grow profitably by allowing them to serve clients faster and to more efficiently manage agency expenses as we make it easier for them to do business with us.  \u2022Drive premium growth \u2013 Implementation of these initiatives is intended to further penetrate each market we serve through our appointed independent agencies. Strategies aimed at specific market opportunities, along with service enhancements, can help our agents grow and increase our share of their business. This includes increasing opportunities for agencies to cross-serve their clients by providing updated products and services that aim to meet their life insurance needs. We continue to increase our capabilities to successfully underwrite both larger commercial policies, which we refer to as key accounts, and small business accounts that require greater efficiency. Premium growth initiatives also include expansion of Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global. Diversified growth also may reduce variability of losses from weather-related catastrophes. Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 6 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 6 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 6   Independent Insurance Agency Marketplace The U.S. property casualty insurance industry is a highly competitive marketplace with more than 2,000\u00a0stock and mutual companies (carriers) operating independently or in groups.   For the most part, we compete with standard market insurance companies that market through independent insurance agents. Agencies marketing our commercial lines or personal lines products typically represent several standard market insurance carriers. We also compete with carriers that market through captive agents representing a single carrier or that market directly to consumers, sometimes offering a less broad range of insurance products. Some of our agencies describe their roles as brokers instead of agents. Distribution through independent insurance agents or brokers represents nearly 60% of overall U.S. property casualty insurance premiums and approximately 80% of commercial property casualty insurance premiums, according to studies by the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of\u00a0America. \u00a0 We are fully committed to the independent agency channel for marketing our insurance policies. For marketing standard lines insurance products, we choose independent agencies that share our philosophies. They generally do business person to person; offer broad, value-added services; and manage their agencies professionally, targeting long-term success. We develop our relationships with agencies, providing important knowledge of local market trends, opportunities and challenges.  Our associates work to support agencies with tools and resources that help communicate the value of choosing an independent insurance agent and our insurance policies to their clients and prospective clients. We help our agencies meet the broader needs of their clients and increase and diversify their revenues and profitability by offering insurance solutions beyond our standard market property casualty insurance products. We\u00a0market life insurance products through the agencies that offer our property casualty products and through other independent life agencies that represent Cincinnati Life without also representing our other subsidiaries. We operate our own excess and surplus lines insurance brokerage firm and insurance carrier so that we can offer our excess and surplus lines products exclusively to the independent agencies who market our other property casualty insurance products. Insurers operating in the excess and surplus lines marketplace generally market business through nonaffiliated excess and surplus lines brokers.    The specialized nature of our other insurance operations helps avoid conflicts with the independent agency distribution channel. Cincinnati Re typically markets through broker organizations or similar intermediaries that specialize in reinsurance. Cincinnati Global markets its business through brokers and coverholders. Coverholders are entities that can be authorized by a Lloyd's syndicate to underwrite policies, manage risks, collect premiums or arrange claims settlements up to agreed upon limits.   The table below includes data about property casualty agency relationships that market our standard market insurance products. It does not include Lloyd's brokers or coverholders that source business for Cincinnati Global.Agency DataYears ended December 31,\u00a020222021Property casualty agency relationships, January 11,9211,848New appointments that market all or most of The Cincinnati Insurance Companies' products145155New appointments that market only personal lines insurance products for Cincinnati Insurance6459Changes due to consolidation and other(146)(141)Property casualty agency relationships, December 311,9841,921Property casualty reporting locations2,8612,721New relationship appointments146159Active states4646  The annual total of agency new appointments may be partially offset by other changes in agency structures, such\u00a0as consolidation through mergers or acquisitions. An increasing number of agencies have multiple, separately\u00a0identifiable locations, reflecting their growth as well as consolidation of ownership within the independent  Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 7 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 7 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 7   agency marketplace. The number of reporting agency locations indicates our agents\u2019 regional scope and the extent of our\u00a0presence within our active states. The difference between new appointments in total and the number of new\u00a0relationships represents either: new branch offices opened by existing Cincinnati agencies; or agencies that merged\u00a0with another Cincinnati agency and we still believed would produce a meaningful amount of new business\u00a0premiums. \u00a0 On average, we have a 5.1% share of the standard lines property casualty insurance purchased through our reporting agency locations, according to 2021 data from agency surveys. Our share is 11.3% in reporting agency locations that have represented us for more than 10\u00a0years; 3.9% in agencies that have represented us for six\u00a0to 10\u00a0years; 1.5% in agencies that have represented us for two to five years; and 0.4% in agencies that have represented us for one year or less. \u00a0 Our largest single agency relationship accounted for approximately 0.6% of our total property casualty earned premiums in 2022. No aggregate locations under a single ownership structure accounted for more than 5% of our earned premiums in 2022. \u00a0 Financial Strength We believe that our financial strength and strong capital and surplus position, reflected in our insurer financial strength ratings, are clear, competitive advantages in the segments of the insurance marketplace that we serve. This\u00a0strength supports the consistent, predictable performance that our policyholders, agents, associates and shareholders have always expected and received, helping us withstand significant challenges. \u00a0 Effective capital management is an important part of creating long-term shareholder value, serving as a foundation to support other strategic areas focused on profitable growth of our insurance business. Our capital management philosophy is intended to preserve and build our capital while maintaining appropriate liquidity.  While the potential exists for short-term financial performance variability due to our exposures to possible natural or man-made catastrophes or to significant capital market losses, the rating agencies consistently assert that we have built appropriate financial strength and flexibility to manage that variability. We remain committed to strategies that emphasize being a consistent, stable market for our agents\u2019 business rather than seeking short-term benefits that might accrue by quick, opportunistic reaction to changes in market conditions. \u00a0 We use various principles and practices such as diversification and enterprise risk management to maintain strong capital. For example, we maintain a diversified investment portfolio by reviewing and applying specific parameters and tolerances. \u2022Our $12.132 billion fixed-maturity portfolio is diversified and exceeds total insurance reserves. The\u00a0portfolio had an average rating of A2/A, and its fair value exceeded total insurance reserve liabilities by approximately 6% at December\u00a031,\u00a02022. No corporate bond exposure accounted for more than 0.9% of our fixed-maturity portfolio, and no municipal exposure accounted for more than 0.2%. \u2022The strength of our fixed-maturity portfolio provides an opportunity to invest for potential capital appreciation by purchasing equity securities. Our $9.841\u00a0billion equity portfolio minimizes concentrations in single stocks or industries. At\u00a0December\u00a031, 2022, no single security accounted for more than 6.4% of our portfolio of publicly traded common stocks, and no single sector accounted for more than 27%.    Strong liquidity increases our flexibility through all periods to maintain our cash dividend\u00a0and to continue to invest in and expand our insurance operations. At\u00a0December\u00a031,\u00a02022, we\u00a0held $4.230\u00a0billion of our cash and invested assets at the parent-company level, of which $3.974\u00a0billion, or 93.9%, was invested in common stocks, and $121\u00a0million, or 2.9%, was cash and cash\u00a0equivalents. \u00a0 We minimize reliance on debt as a source of capital, with a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 7.4% at\u00a0year-end 2022. Long-term debt at year-end 2022 totaled $789\u00a0million, matching year-end 2021, and our short-term debt was $50\u00a0million, down from $54 million at the end of the prior year. The long-term debt consists of three\u00a0nonconvertible, noncallable debentures, two\u00a0due in 2028\u00a0and one in\u00a02034. Ratings for our long-term debt are discussed in Item 7, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Long-Term Debt of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 8 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 8 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 8   At year-end 2022 and 2021, risk-based capital (RBC) for our standard market property casualty insurance, excess and surplus lines insurance and life insurance subsidiaries was strong, far exceeding regulatory\u00a0requirements. \u2022We ended 2022 with a 1.1-to-1 ratio of property casualty premiums to surplus, a key measure of property casualty insurance company capacity and security. A lower ratio indicates more security for policyholders and greater capacity for growth by an insurer. We believe our ratio provides ample flexibility to diversify risk by expanding our\u00a0operations into new geographies and product areas. The estimated industry average ratio was 0.8-to-1 at year-end 2022, based on industry data reported through the first nine months of 2022. On a statutory consolidated property casualty insurance basis, our ratio of investments in common stock, at fair value, to statutory capital and surplus was 83.7% at year-end 2022 compared with 83.6% at year-end 2021. \u2022We ended 2022 with a 9.5% ratio of life statutory adjusted risk-based surplus to liabilities, a key measure of life insurance company capital strength. A higher ratio indicates an insurer\u2019s stronger security for policyholders and capacity to support business\u00a0growth. Our life insurance subsidiary\u2019s RBC at year-end 2022 was 6.1 times the authorized control level RBC.(Dollars in millions)                                           Statutory InformationAt December 31,\u00a020222021Standard market property casualty insurance subsidiary\u00a0\u00a0Statutory capital and surplus$6,512\u00a0$7,247\u00a0Risk-based capital 6,551\u00a07,279\u00a0Authorized control level risk-based capital1,186\u00a01,093\u00a0Risk-based capital to authorized control level risk-based capital ratio5.5\u00a06.7\u00a0Written premium to surplus ratio1.1\u00a00.9\u00a0 (Dollars in millions)                                           Statutory Information  Cincinnati Financial Corporation\u2019s senior debt is rated by four independent rating firms. In addition, the rating firms award our property casualty and life operations insurance financial strength ratings based on their quantitative and qualitative analyses. These ratings assess an insurer\u2019s ability to meet financial obligations to policyholders and do not necessarily address all of the matters that may be important to shareholders. Ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other\u00a0rating. \u00a0 At February 22, 2023, our insurance subsidiaries continued to be highly rated.Insurer Financial Strength RatingsRatingagencyStandard market propertycasualty insurance subsidiaryLife insurancesubsidiaryExcess and surplus linesinsurance subsidiaryOutlook\u00a0Rating TierRating TierRatingTierA.M.

We recognize that locally based independent agencies have relationships in their communities and local marketplace intelligence that can lead to profitable business and policyholder satisfaction and loyalty. Several of our strategic initiatives are\u00a0intended not only to help us compete but also to enhance support of agencies that represent us, thereby contributing to agency success. We seek to be a consistent and predictable property casualty carrier that agencies can rely on to serve their clients.  \u00a0 In our 10 highest volume states for consolidated property casualty premiums, 1,386 reporting agency locations wrote\u00a050.1% of our 2022 consolidated property casualty earned premium volume compared with 1,359\u00a0locations and 52.1% in 2021.

These associates live in the communities our agents serve, so they are readily available when agencies or policyholders need them. While their work is often conducted at the premises of the agency or policyholder, they also work from offices in their homes. Headquarters associates support agencies and field associates with underwriting, accounting, technology assistance, training and other services. Company executives and headquarters associates typically travel to visit agencies, strengthening the personal relationships we have with these organizations. Agents have opportunities for direct, personal conversations with our senior management team, and headquarters associates have opportunities to refresh their knowledge of marketplace conditions and field activities. \u00a0 The field team is coordinated by field marketing representatives responsible for underwriting new commercial lines business. They are joined by field representatives specializing in claims, loss control, commercial lines key accounts, personal lines, excess and surplus lines, machinery and equipment, management liability and surety, premium audit and life insurance. The\u00a0field team provides a variety of services, such as recommending specific actions to improve the safety of the policyholder\u2019s operations. We seek to develop long-term relationships by understanding the unique needs of each agency's clients, who are also our\u00a0policyholders. \u00a0 Technology enhances our service to agencies, allowing them to more easily access our systems and process business transactions. Policyholders can conveniently access pertinent policy information online, helping to reduce costs for agencies and the company. Technology and ongoing training also help our associates collaborate and process business efficiently, providing more time for personal service to agencies and their clients.  We also provide and continue to develop enhanced, tailored services offered at the time a claim is reported for an insured loss event. Those services include assisting with car rental or towing, arranging temporary housing and coordinating emergency repairs to homes so additional damage is minimized.  Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 10 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 10 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 10     Our claims philosophy reflects our belief that we prosper as a company by responding to claims person to person, paying covered claims promptly, preventing false claims from unfairly adding to overall premiums and building financial strength to meet future obligations. \u00a0 Our 862 locally based field claims associates, often referred to as field claims representatives, work from their homes and are assigned to specific agencies. They respond personally to policyholders and claimants and are equipped to handle a claim from nearly anywhere. We believe we have a competitive advantage because of the person-to-person approach and the resulting high level of service that our field claims representatives and Express Claims Center associates deliver. For field claims representatives handling excess and surplus lines claims, guidance is provided by headquarters-based excess and surplus lines claims managers. Claims may be reported directly to us by calling our claims call center, online via our company website or through the MyCincinnati app using a mobile device.  Catastrophe response teams are comprised of our experienced field claims representatives who have the authority they need to do their jobs. In times of widespread loss, our field claims representatives confidently and quickly resolve claims, with the ability to provide claims payments on the same day they inspect the loss. Technology helps to enable fast initial contact with policyholders and easy sharing of information and data among storm teams, headquarters associates and local field claims representatives. When hurricanes or other weather events are predicted, we can identify through mapping technologies the expected number of our policyholders that may be impacted by the event and choose to have catastrophe response team members travel to strategic locations near the expected impact area. They are then in position to quickly get to the affected area and begin providing service to\u00a0policyholders.  Our 31 associates working in the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) include former law enforcement and claims professionals whose qualifications make them well suited to gathering facts to uncover potential fraud. While we believe our job is to pay what is due under each policy contract, we also want to prevent false claims from unfairly increasing overall premiums. Our SIU also operates a computer forensics lab that supports field investigation efforts in various ways including assistance with video evidence and data recovery.  We seek to attract and retain high-quality independent insurance agencies with knowledgeable, professional staff. In\u00a0turn, we make an exceptionally strong commitment to assist them in keeping their knowledge up to date and educating new people they bring on board as they grow. This includes offering classes, usually at no cost to agencies, except travel-related expenses they may incur, and other training support. We also offer noninsurance financial services. We believe that providing these services enhances agency relationships with the company and their clients, increasing loyalty while diversifying the agency\u2019s revenues. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 11 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 11 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 11   Human Capital At the end of 2022, we employed 5,148 associates, including 3,214\u00a0headquarters associates who provide support to 1,862 field associates and 72 associates for Cincinnati Global. The associate voluntary turnover rate was 8% in 2022, 7% in 2021 and 3% in 2020.   We believe our compensation, training, technology, inclusive culture and career development opportunities help to attract and retain talented associates, which is critical to our strategy that emphasizes superior service to agencies and their clients, as described in this report. Our goal is to hire job candidates with promise, matching their strengths to positions within the company and providing resources to help them meet professional and personal goals. We are committed to providing equal opportunity for all associates, encouraging a work environment free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.   We use multiple channels to ensure we recruit a diverse workforce rich with ideas and knowledge. For example, we\u00a0build relationships with future talent by partnering with career services departments, faculty and staff, and Diversity and Inclusion Offices at local and regional colleges and universities along with historically Black colleges and universities.  We offer a base pay level for all roles that is competitive, market-based and re-evaluated on a recurring basis. The\u00a0base pay is complemented by a matching 401(k) program, annual cash bonus and stock ownership opportunities along with healthcare benefits to provide a comprehensive compensation and benefits package. In\u00a0addition, we have many special programs that appeal to associates while aligning with our corporate values. We\u00a0believe our voluntary turnover rate indicates overall associate satisfaction with their working environment, compensation and benefits.   We strive to offer equal pay for equal work and use independent consultants to conduct gender and ethnic minority pay equity studies examining total direct compensation, which consists of base salary, cash bonus and equity awards. Using a multivariate regression analysis, the independent studies in 2022 showed that we administer pay fairly and equitably because the factors used to make compensation decisions, such as role, salary grade, tenure and performance do in fact drive compensation awarded to each associate. More information about the studies is available in our Environmental, Social and Governance Report available on the Sustainability page of our website, cinfin.com/sustainability, which is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We offer all regular, full- and part-time associates the opportunity to participate in the CFC Savings Plan, our 401(k) plan. We also offer all full-time associates the opportunity to purchase health, prescription, vision and dental insurance. Associates enrolled in our health plan can receive a free biometric screening \u2013 either onsite at our headquarters or with their personal physician. The screening helps associates learn about their health and identify risk factors while earning a company contribution into their Health Savings Account.  While providing stock compensation at all levels of an organization may not be a common business practice, we firmly believe that stock ownership helps drive good decision making and encourages a long-term view by associates. We historically grant annual stock-based compensation to full-time, salaried associates in the form of stock options and restricted stock units that vest over time. In addition, each year all regular, full-time associates \u2013 salaried and hourly \u2013 are awarded one share of stock for each full calendar year of service, up to 10 shares, through our Holiday Stock Plan.   Additional information is available in our Environmental, Social and Governance Report available on the Sustainability page of our website, cinfin.com/sustainability.

For most agencies that represent us, we believe we offer insurance solutions for approximately 75% of the typical insurable risks of their clients. Products for various business lines within our reporting segments include insurance coverages for business property and liability, automobiles and\u00a0homes.

These segments are defined based on financial information we use to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of assets. \u2022Commercial lines insurance \u2022Personal lines insurance \u2022Excess and surplus lines insurance \u2022Life insurance \u2022Investments   Revenues, income before income taxes and identifiable assets for each segment are shown in Item\u00a08, Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of that information is discussed in this section, where we explain the business operations of each segment. The\u00a0financial performance of each segment is discussed in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 14 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 14 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 14   Commercial Lines Insurance Segment In 2022, the commercial lines insurance segment contributed net earned premiums of $4.024\u00a0billion, representing 61.4% of consolidated total revenues. This segment reported profit before income taxes of $38\u00a0million. Commercial lines net earned premiums rose 10% in 2022 and 6% in 2021. \u00a0 We believe that our commercial lines business is best measured and evaluated on a segment basis. However, we also provide selected line of business data to summarize growth and profitability trends separately for our business lines. The five commercial business lines are: \u2022Commercial casualty \u2013 Provides coverage to businesses against third-party liability from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations, including injuries sustained from products or liability related to professional services. Specialized casualty policies may include similar coverage such as umbrella liability or employment practices. The commercial casualty business line includes liability coverage written as part of commercial package\u00a0policies. \u2022Commercial property \u2013 Provides coverage for loss or damage to buildings, inventory and equipment caused by\u00a0covered causes of loss such as fire, wind, hail, water, theft and vandalism, as well as business interruption resulting from a covered loss. Commercial property also includes other coverages such as inland marine, which\u00a0covers losses related to builder\u2019s risk, cargo or equipment. Various property coverages can be written as stand-alone policies or can be added to a commercial package policy.  \u2022Commercial auto \u2013 Protects businesses against liability to others for both bodily injury and property\u00a0damage, medical payments to insureds and occupants of their vehicles, physical damage to an\u00a0insured\u2019s own vehicle from collision and various other perils, and damages caused by uninsured\u00a0motorists. \u2022Workers\u2019 compensation \u2013 Covers employers for government-specified benefits from work-related injuries to\u00a0employees.  \u2022Other commercial lines \u2013 This includes several other types of insurance products for businesses, including: \u25e6Management liability and surety \u2013 Includes director and officer (D&O) liability insurance, which covers liability for actual or alleged errors in judgment, breaches of duty or other wrongful acts related to activities of organizations and can optionally include other liability coverages. We market primarily to nonprofit organizations, privately held businesses, healthcare organizations, financial institutions and educational institutions. The for-profit portion includes approximately 160 bank or savings and loan financial institutions, with none having assets of $1 billion or more. The surety portion includes contract and commercial surety bonds for losses resulting from dishonesty, failure to perform and other\u00a0acts and also includes fidelity bonds for fraudulent acts by specified individuals or dishonest acts by\u00a0employees. Management liability coverage can also include cyber insurance as an affirmative coverage option on various insurance policies. We cede all of the related cyber insurance premiums to a reinsurer, therefore transferring substantially all of that risk. Ceded premiums for 2022 included $47 million for cyber insurance. \u25e6Machinery and equipment \u2013 Specialized coverage provides protection for loss or damage to boilers and machinery, including production and computer equipment and business interruption, due to sudden and accidental mechanical breakdown, steam explosion or artificially generated electrical\u00a0current.  Our history of emphasizing products and services that agencies can market to small or midsized businesses in their communities remains a critical piece of our strategy even as we expand our appetite to insure larger businesses. While\u00a0some of our property casualty agencies market only our personal lines or management liability and surety products, approximately 85% offer some or all of our standard market commercial insurance\u00a0products. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 15 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 15 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 15   In 2022, our 10 highest volume commercial lines states generated 56.2% of our earned premiums\u00a0compared with 56.7% in 2021. The aggregate number of reporting agency locations in our 10\u00a0highest volume states increased to 1,228\u00a0in 2022 from 1,174 in\u00a02021.

Our agents and our team of field associates get to know the people and businesses in their communities and can make informed decisions about each risk.  \u00a0 Commercial lines policy renewals are managed by headquarters underwriters who are assigned to specific agencies and consult with local field associates as needed. As part of our team approach, headquarters underwriters also help oversee agency growth and profitability. They are responsible for formal issuance of all new\u00a0business and renewal policies as well as policy endorsements. Further, the headquarters underwriters provide day-to-day customer service to agencies and our field marketing representatives by offering technical and industry expertise and product training, helping to determine underwriting eligibility and assisting with the mechanics of premium determination. We also continue a target markets emphasis to analyze opportunities and to develop new products and services, new coverage options and improvements to existing insurance products. \u00a0 Understanding evolving market conditions is a critical function for our success, accomplished through both informal\u00a0commentary and formal reviews. Informally, our field marketing representatives, underwriters and product\u00a0development associates routinely receive market intelligence from a variety of channels, including from the\u00a0agencies with which they work. This market information helps identify the top competitors and our market strengths and weaknesses. The information obtained encompasses pricing, breadth of coverage and use of underwriting guidelines.  Our historical emphasis on small to midsized businesses is reflected in the mix of our commercial lines premium volume by policy size. Approximately 70% of our commercial in-force policies have annual premiums of $10,000 or less, accounting in total for approximately 15% of our 2022 commercial lines premium volume. The remainder of policies have annual premiums greater than $10,000, including policies with annual premiums greater than $100,000 that account for approximately 35% of our 2022\u00a0commercial lines premium\u00a0volume. Our average commercial lines policy size is approximately $15,000 in annual premiums. \u00a0 Our commercial lines packages typically are offered on a three-year policy term for most insurance coverages \u2013 a\u00a0key competitive advantage. In our experience, multi-year packages appeal to the quality-conscious insurance buyers who we believe are typical clients of our independent agents. Customized insurance programs on a three-year term complement the long-term relationships these policyholders typically have with their agents and with our company. By reducing annual administrative efforts, multi-year policies lower expenses for our company and for our agents. The commitment we make to policyholders encourages long-term relationships and reduces their need to annually re-evaluate their insurance carrier or agency. We believe that the advantages of three-year policies in  Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 16 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 16 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 16   terms of improved policyholder convenience, increased account retention and reduced administrative costs outweigh the potential disadvantage of these policies, even in periods of rising\u00a0rates. \u00a0 Although we offer three-year policy terms, premiums for some coverages within those policies are adjustable at the anniversary for the next annual period, and policies may be canceled at any time at the discretion of the policyholder. Contract terms often provide that rates for property, general liability, inland marine and crime coverages, as well as policy terms and conditions, are fixed for the term of the policy. However, the exposure we insure is reviewed annually, near the policy anniversary date, and the amount of premiums may be adjusted based on changes to that exposure.  \u00a0 The\u00a0general liability exposure basis may be audited annually. Commercial auto, workers\u2019 compensation, professional liability and most umbrella liability coverages within multi-year packages are rated at each of the policy\u2019s annual anniversaries for the next one-year period. The annual pricing could incorporate rate changes approved by state insurance regulatory authorities between the date the policy was written and its annual anniversary date, as well as changes in risk exposures and premium credits or debits relating to loss\u00a0experience and other underwriting judgment factors. We estimate that approximately 75% of 2022 commercial premiums were subject to annual rating or were written on a one-year policy term. That 75% includes approximately one-third of policies offered on a three-year policy term that expire during any given year. \u00a0 We believe our commercial lines insurance segment premiums reflect a higher concentration, relative to industry commercial lines premiums, in contractor-related businesses. Since economic activity related to construction, which can heavily influence insured exposures of contractors, may experience cycles that vary\u00a0significantly with the economy as a whole, our commercial lines premium trends could vary from commercial lines premium trends for the property casualty insurance industry. In 2022, we estimated that 38% of our general liability premiums, and 35% of our workers\u2019 compensation premiums, came from the construction industry based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 17 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 17 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 17   Personal Lines Insurance Segment The personal lines insurance segment contributed net earned premiums of $1.689\u00a0billion to 2022 consolidated total\u00a0revenues, or 25.8% of the total, and reported profit before income taxes of $18 million. Personal\u00a0lines net earned premiums rose 10% in 2022 and 5% in 2021. \u00a0 We prefer to write personal lines coverage in accounts that include both auto and homeowner coverages as well as coverages that are part of our other personal business line. At the end of 2022, for example, approximately 83% of our homeowner policies were accompanied by a personal auto policy in the same account. As\u00a0a result of our account-based approach, we believe that our personal lines business is best measured and evaluated on a segment basis. However, we provide line of business data to summarize growth and profitability trends separately for three business\u00a0lines: \u2022Personal auto \u2013 Protects against liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage, medical payments to insureds and occupants of their vehicle, physical damage to an insured\u2019s own vehicle from collision and various other perils, and damages caused by uninsured motorists. In addition, many states require policies to provide first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault\u00a0coverage. \u2022Homeowner \u2013 Protects against losses to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils, as well as liability arising out of personal activities both on and off the covered premises. We also offer coverage for condominium unit owners and renters. \u2022Other personal lines \u2013 This includes the other types of insurance products we offer to individuals, including dwelling fire, inland marine, personal umbrella liability and watercraft coverages.  At year-end 2022, we marketed personal lines insurance products through 2,076, or approximately 73%, of our\u00a02,861\u00a0agency reporting locations. The 2,076 personal lines agency locations were in 45 of the 46 states in which we offered property casualty insurance. Those agencies produced approximately 1.0 million personal lines policies in force for us, representing approximately 400,000 policyholders.   Expansion of our personal lines insurance segment includes marketing through independent agencies to profitably grow our premiums for products and services offered to their high net worth personal lines clients. In 2022, our appointed agencies produced for us approximately $919 million of net written premiums in total from policyholders with insured home values of $1 million or more, up 39% from 2021. We estimate those policyholders represent approximately 25% of our total personal lines policyholders. Beginning in 2023, we\u2019re renaming our high net worth products and services, Cincinnati Private ClientSM. Private client is a term used in the financial services industry to describe people who have complex needs based on their affluence, investments and belongings. This change allows agencies and their customers to easily recognize that we stand ready to serve this client segment. \u00a0 In 2022, our 10 highest volume personal lines states generated 64.5% of our earned premiums compared with 64.8% in 2021. In 2015, our 10 highest volume personal lines states generated 78.5% of our earned premiums. The\u00a0reduction in that percentage indicates progress over time toward our long-term objective of geographic diversification through new states for our personal lines operation. The aggregate\u00a0number of reporting agency locations in our 10\u00a0highest volume states decreased to 999 in 2022 from 1,002 in 2021. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 18 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 18 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 18   Our 10 largest states based on personal lines premium volume are shown in the table below.

Each agency selects personal lines business primarily from within the geographic territory that it serves, based in part on agency staff\u2019s\u00a0knowledge of the risks in those communities or familiarity with the policyholder. We have personal lines field marketing representatives who have underwriting authority and visit agencies on a regular basis. They focus primarily on key states targeted for growth, reinforcing the advantages of our personal lines products and offering training in the use of our policy processing system. Personal lines activities are further supported by headquarters associates assigned to individual agencies. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 19 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 19 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 19   Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance Segment The excess and surplus lines segment contributed net earned premiums of $485\u00a0million to 2022 consolidated total revenues, or 7.4% of the total, and reported profit before income taxes of $48 million. Excess and surplus lines net earned premium increased 22% in both 2022 and 2021. \u00a0 Our excess and surplus lines policies typically cover business risks with unique characteristics, such as the nature of the business or its claim history, that are difficult to profitably insure in the standard commercial lines market. Excess and surplus lines insurers have more flexibility in coverage terms and rates compared with standard lines companies, generally resulting in policies with higher rates and terms and conditions customized for specific risks, including restricted coverage where appropriate. We target small to midsized risks, and policyholders in many cases also have standard market insurance with one of our other subsidiaries. Our average excess and surplus lines policy size is approximately $9,000 in annual premiums, and the majority have coverage limits of $1\u00a0million or less. All of our excess and surplus lines policies are written for a maximum term of one year. Approximately 92% of our 2022 earned premiums for the excess and surplus lines insurance segment provided commercial casualty coverages and about 8% provided commercial property coverages. Those coverages are described\u00a0below. \u2022Commercial casualty \u2013 Covers businesses for third-party liability from accidents occurring on their premises or\u00a0arising out of their operations, including injuries sustained from products. Other coverages available include miscellaneous errors and omissions, professional liability and excess liability. Typical businesses covered include\u00a0contractors, manufacturers, real estate owners and managers, retail, consultants, and bars or taverns. Policies covering liability at special events are also available. \u2022Commercial property \u2013 Insures buildings, inventory, equipment and business income from loss or damage due to causes such as fire, wind, hail, water, theft and vandalism. Examples of property we commonly insure with excess and surplus lines policies include temporarily vacant buildings, habitational, restaurants and relatively higher-hazard manufacturing classes.  At the end of 2022, we marketed excess and surplus lines insurance products in each of the 42 states in which we offer standard market commercial lines insurance. Offering excess and surplus lines helps agencies representing The Cincinnati Insurance Companies meet the insurance needs of their clients when coverage is unavailable in the standard market. By providing outstanding service, we can help agencies grow and prosper while also profitably growing our property casualty business. \u00a0 In 2022, our 10 highest volume excess and surplus lines states generated 53.7% of our earned premiums, compared with 54.9% in 2021. \u00a0 Our 10 largest states based on excess and surplus lines premium volume are shown in the table below.

We estimate that approximately half of that premium volume matches the targeted business types and coverages we offer through our excess and surplus lines insurance segment. We structured the operations of this segment to meet the needs of these agencies and to market exclusively through them. \u00a0 Agencies have access to Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters' product line through CSU\u00a0Producer Resources, the wholly owned insurance brokerage subsidiary of Cincinnati\u00a0Financial Corporation. CSU Producer Resources has binding authority on all classes of business written through Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters and maintains appropriate agent and surplus lines licenses. \u00a0 We seek to earn a share of each agency\u2019s best excess and surplus lines accounts by offering several unique benefits. Agency producers have direct access through CSU Producer Resources to a group of our underwriters who focus exclusively on excess and surplus lines business. Those underwriters can tap into\u00a0broader services we offer to provide policyholders additional value and help producers build the relationship through experienced and responsive loss control services and claims handling. CSU Producer Resources gives extra support to our independent agency producers by remitting surplus lines taxes and stamping fees and retaining admitted market diligent search\u00a0affidavits, where\u00a0required. Agencies marketing through CSU Producer Resources instead of a competing brokerage\u00a0generally receive a higher commission because use of our internal brokerage subsidiary eliminates some\u00a0of the intermediary costs. This business is factored in their profit-sharing agreement with The\u00a0Cincinnati Insurance Companies. We also offer prompt service, generally issuing approximately 95% of policies within 24 hours of a request to bind a policy. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 21 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 21 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 21   Life Insurance Segment The life insurance segment contributed $295\u00a0million of net earned premiums, representing 4.5% of 2022 consolidated total revenues, and reported a gain before income taxes of $28\u00a0million. Life\u00a0insurance net earned premiums decreased 1% in 2022 and grew 3% in 2021. \u00a0 The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company supports our agency-centered business model by deepening the relationships we have with agents while also diversifying revenue and profitability for both the agency and our company. We\u00a0primarily focus on life products that feature a steady stream of premium payments and that have the potential for generating revenue growth through increasing demand. Pricing life insurance policies includes assumptions for mortality, persistency, expenses and investment earnings while also considering the time value of money related to expected cash flows and a reasonable profit margin.  \u00a0 Life Insurance Business Lines Four lines of business that account for more than 99% of the life insurance segment\u2019s revenues are: \u2022Term life insurance \u2013 Policies under which a death benefit is payable only if the insured dies during a\u00a0specific period of time. Policy options include a return of premium provision, a\u00a0benefit equal to the sum of all paid base premiums that is payable if the insured person survives\u00a0to the end of the term. The policies are fully underwritten using traditional and accelerated methods. \u2022Worksite products \u2013 Term life insurance, return of premium term life insurance and whole life insurance offered to employees through their employer. Premiums are collected by the employer using payroll deduction. Policies are issued using a simplified underwriting approach and on a guaranteed issue basis. Worksite insurance products provide our property casualty agency force with excellent cross-serving opportunities for both commercial and personal accounts.  \u2022Whole life insurance \u2013 Policies that provide life insurance for the entire lifetime of the insured. The death benefit is guaranteed never to decrease and premiums are guaranteed never to increase. While\u00a0premiums are fixed, they must be paid as scheduled. These policies provide guaranteed cash\u00a0values that are available as loans collateralized by the cash surrender value. The policies are fully\u00a0underwritten. \u2022Universal life insurance \u2013 Long-duration life insurance policies that are fully underwritten. Contract premiums are neither fixed nor guaranteed; however, the contract does specify a minimum interest crediting rate and a maximum cost of insurance charge and expense charge. The cash values, available as loans collateralized by the cash surrender value, are not guaranteed and depend on the amount and timing of actual premium payments and the amount of actual contract assessments.    In addition, Cincinnati Life markets: \u2022Deferred annuities that provide regular income payments that commence after the end of a specified period\u00a0or when the annuitant attains a specified age. During the deferral period, any payments made under the contract accumulate at the crediting rate declared by the company but not less than a contract-specified guaranteed minimum interest rate. A deferred annuity may be surrendered during the deferral period for a\u00a0cash value equal to the accumulated payments plus interest less the surrender charge, if any. \u2022Immediate annuities that provide some combination of regular income and lump-sum payments in exchange for a single premium.

At year-end 2022, approximately 80% of our 1,984 property casualty agency relationships offered Cincinnati Life products to their clients. We also develop life business from approximately 366 other independent life insurance agencies. We are careful to solicit business from these other agencies in a manner that does not conflict with or compete with the marketing and sales efforts of our property casualty agencies. \u00a0 When marketing through our property casualty agencies, we have specific competitive advantages: \u2022Because our property casualty operations are held in high regard, property casualty agency management is predisposed to consider selling our life products. \u2022Marketing efforts for both our property casualty and life insurance businesses are directed by our field marketing\u00a0department, coordinated with our life field marketing representatives, which assures consistency of communication and operations. Life field marketing representatives are available to meet face-to-face with agency personnel and their clients as well. Our life headquarters underwriters and other associates are available to the agents and field team to assist in the placement of business.   We continue to emphasize the cross-serving opportunities of our life insurance, including term and worksite products, for the property casualty agency\u2019s personal and commercial accounts. In both the property casualty and independent life agency distribution systems, we enjoy the advantages of offering competitive, up-to-date products and providing personal attention in combination with financial strength and stability. \u2022Term life insurance is our largest life insurance product line. We continue to develop and offer term products with features our agents indicate are important, such as a return of premium benefit and an accelerated underwriting option. \u2022We also offer products addressing the needs of businesses with key person and buy-sell coverages. We\u00a0offer quality, personal life insurance\u00a0coverage to personal and commercial clients of our agencies.   Because of our strong capital position, we can offer a competitive product portfolio, including guaranteed products, giving our agents a marketing edge. Our life insurance company maintains strong insurer financial strength ratings: A.M. Best, A+ (Superior); Fitch, A+ (Strong); and S&P, A+\u00a0(Strong). Our life insurance company has chosen not to establish a Moody\u2019s\u00a0rating. \u00a0 In 2022, our five highest volume states for life insurance premiums, based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments, are shown in the table below.

These guidelines set parameters for risk tolerances governing, among other items, the allocation of the portfolio as well as security and sector concentrations. These parameters are part of an integrated corporate risk management program. When allocating cash to various asset classes, we consider market-based factors such as risk adjusted after-tax yields as well as internal measures based in part on insurance department regulations and rating agency guidance. \u00a0 The fair value of our investment portfolio was $21.973 billion and $24.337 billion at year-end\u00a02022 and 2021, respectively, as shown in the table below. The overall portfolio decreased in fair value, due to a decrease in its unrealized gain position. The 2022 decreases reflected a general decline in equity markets and movement from a net unrealized gain position in our fixed-maturity investments to a net unrealized loss position, primarily due to an increase in interest rates, such as U.S. Treasury yields, and widening of corporate credit spreads.

During\u00a02022, the combined effect of a net decrease in unrealized gains, sales and calls of fixed-maturity securities in our portfolio offset net purchases. During\u00a02021, net purchases offset a net decrease in unrealized gains, sales and calls.  \u2022Equity investments \u2013 Includes common and nonredeemable preferred stocks. During 2022, the combined effect of a net decrease in fair value and sales of equity securities in our portfolio offset net purchases. During\u00a02021, purchases and a net increase in fair value offset sales.  \u00a0 In addition to securities held in our investment portfolio at year-end 2022, other invested assets included $337\u00a0million of private equity investments, $47 million of real estate through direct property ownership and development projects in the United States, $37 million held on deposit at Lloyd's and $31\u00a0million of life policy loans.  Our investment portfolio is further described below. Additional information about the composition and valuation of investments is included in Item 8, Note 2, Investments, and Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, of the Consolidated Financial Statements. A detailed listing of our portfolio is updated on our website, cinfin.com/investors, each quarter when we report our quarterly financial results.  Fixed-Maturity Securities Investments By maintaining a well-diversified fixed-maturity portfolio, we attempt to manage overall interest rate, reinvestment, credit and liquidity risk. We pursue a buy-and-hold strategy and do not attempt to make large-scale changes to the portfolio in anticipation of rate movements. By investing new money on a regular basis and analyzing risk-adjusted after-tax yields, we work to achieve a general laddering effect to our portfolio that may mitigate some of the effects of adverse interest rate movements. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 24 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 24 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 24   At December 31, 2022, our investment-grade and noninvestment-grade fixed-maturity securities represented 80.1% and 4.2% of the portfolio, respectively. The remaining 15.7% represented fixed-maturity securities that were not rated by Moody\u2019s or S&P. Our nonrated securities include smaller municipal issues and private placement corporate securities. Many of these, although not rated by Moody\u2019s or S&P, are rated by the Securities\u2019 Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Also included in this category are smaller public corporate securities, many of which carry a rating by an agency other than Moody\u2019s or S&P, such as Fitch or Kroll.   Other selected attributes of the fixed-maturity portfolio are shown in the table below. Additional maturity periods\u00a0and\u00a0other information for our fixed-maturity portfolio are shown in Item 8, Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial\u00a0Statements.\u00a0At December 31,\u00a020222021Weighted average yield-to-amortized cost4.22\u00a0%4.02\u00a0%Weighted average maturity7.4\u00a0yrs8.0\u00a0yrsEffective duration4.7\u00a0yrs4.8\u00a0yrs \u00a0 The fair values of our taxable fixed-maturity securities portfolio at the end of the last two years were:(Dollars in millions)At December 31,\u00a020222021Investment-grade corporate$6,369\u00a0$6,807\u00a0States, municipalities and political subdivisions789\u00a0931\u00a0Noninvestment-grade corporate500\u00a0690\u00a0Commercial mortgage-backed 234\u00a0273\u00a0United States government191\u00a0123\u00a0Government-sponsored enterprises183\u00a08\u00a0Foreign government33\u00a026\u00a0Total$8,299\u00a0$8,858\u00a0 \u00a0 While our strategy typically is to buy and hold fixed-maturity investments to maturity, we monitor credit profiles and\u00a0fair value movements when determining holding periods for individual securities. With the exception of U.S.\u00a0agency issues, no\u00a0individual issuer's securities accounted for more than 1.2% of the taxable fixed-maturity portfolio at year-end\u00a02022. Investment-grade corporate bonds had an average rating of Baa1 by Moody\u2019s or BBB by S&P at year-end 2022. Our taxable fixed-maturity portfolio included $234 million of commercial mortgage-backed securities with an average rating of Aa2/AA- at year-end 2022. \u00a0 Relative to a broad bond market index such as the Barclay\u2019s Aggregate, we are most heavily exposed to the investment-grade corporate bond asset class. Within that asset class, we have a weighting of 42.7% for the financial sector, higher than the 38.8% weighting for the financial sectors of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Index. Relative to the Barclay\u2019s Aggregate, we are overweight in the commercial mortgage-backed securities asset class while having no exposure to the much larger residential mortgage-backed market. \u00a0 At December 31, 2022, we had $3.833 billion of tax-exempt fixed-maturity securities with an average rating of Aa2/AA by Moody\u2019s and S&P. The portfolio is well diversified among approximately 1,700 municipal bond issuers. No\u00a0single municipal issuer accounted for more than 0.6% of the tax-exempt fixed-maturity portfolio at year-end 2022.  \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 25 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 25 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 25   Equity Securities Investments After covering both our intermediate and long-range insurance obligations with fixed-maturity investments, we historically have used some available cash flow to invest in equity securities. Our equity securities portfolio\u00a0includes common stocks and nonredeemable preferred stocks, primarily in larger-capitalization companies but sometimes in smaller entities with attractive growth prospects. Investments in equity securities have\u00a0played\u00a0an\u00a0important role in achieving our portfolio objectives and have contributed to both growth of investment income and portfolio appreciation. We\u00a0remain\u00a0committed to our long-term equity focus, which we believe is a key factor to our company\u2019s long-term growth\u00a0and\u00a0stability. We believe our strategy of primarily investing in a diversified selection of high-quality, larger-capitalization, dividend-increasing companies generally results in reduced volatility relative to the broader equity\u00a0markets. \u00a0 For federal income tax purposes, taxes on gains from appreciated investments generally are not due until securities\u00a0are sold. We believe that the appreciated value of equity securities, compared with the cost of securities that is generally used as a tax basis, is a useful measure to help evaluate how fair value can change over time. On\u00a0this basis, the net unrealized investment gains at year-end 2022 consisted of a net gain position in our equity portfolio of $5.547 billion. Events or factors such as economic growth or recession can affect the fair value of our equity\u00a0securities.  At year-end 2022, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq:AAPL) was our largest single common stock investment, comprising 6.3% of our publicly traded common stock portfolio and 2.7% of the entire investment\u00a0portfolio. The\u00a0parent company held 42.0% of our common stock holdings (measured by fair value). The distribution of the portfolio among industry sectors is shown in the table\u00a0below. \u00a0 Common Stock Portfolio Industry Sector Distribution\u00a0Percent of common stock portfolio\u00a0At December 31, 2022At December 31, 2021\u00a0CincinnatiFinancialS&P 500 IndustryWeightingsCincinnatiFinancialS&P 500 IndustryWeightingsSector:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Information technology26.5\u00a0%25.7\u00a0%31.1\u00a0%29.2\u00a0%Healthcare15.0\u00a015.8\u00a013.5\u00a013.3\u00a0Financial13.6\u00a011.7\u00a014.2\u00a010.7\u00a0Industrials11.9\u00a08.7\u00a011.1\u00a07.8\u00a0Consumer staples8.8\u00a07.2\u00a06.9\u00a05.9\u00a0Consumer discretionary7.7\u00a09.8\u00a08.3\u00a012.5\u00a0Materials5.0\u00a02.7\u00a04.4\u00a02.5\u00a0Energy5.0\u00a05.2\u00a04.0\u00a02.7\u00a0Utilities2.9\u00a03.2\u00a02.2\u00a02.5\u00a0Real estate2.3\u00a02.7\u00a02.7\u00a02.8\u00a0Telecomm services1.3\u00a07.3\u00a01.6\u00a010.1\u00a0Total100.0\u00a0%100.0\u00a0%100.0\u00a0%100.0\u00a0% \u00a0 We evaluate nonredeemable preferred stocks in a manner similar to our evaluation of fixed-maturity investments, seeking\u00a0attractive relative yields. We generally focus on investment-grade nonredeemable preferred stocks issued by companies with strong histories of paying common dividends, providing us with another layer of protection. Consideration is also given to nonredeemable preferred stocks that offer a dividend received deduction for income tax purposes. We purchased $54 million and $173 million of nonredeemable preferred stocks during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 26 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 26 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 26    Other What we report as Other includes the noninvestment operations of the parent company and its noninsurer subsidiary, CFC\u00a0Investment Company. At\u00a0year-end 2022, this subsidiary had $92\u00a0million in receivables related to its commercial leasing and financing services, compared with $98\u00a0million in receivables at year-end\u00a02021.   We also report as Other the results of Cincinnati Re, which has contracts, also referred to as treaties, with other insurance or reinsurance companies to assume a portion of their insured risk in exchange for a portion of premiums from insurance policies covering those risks. The treaties and their exposure to losses are diverse in nature, including various lines of business and geographies for the reinsured risks. Some of our treaties reflect a type of contract commonly referred to as participating or proportional, typically sharing premiums and losses between the reinsured entity and us, as reinsurer, on a pro rata basis. Some are a contract type commonly referred to as excess of loss, where we indemnify the reinsured entity only for losses exceeding a predetermined amount.   Net written premiums for Cincinnati Re totaled $585\u00a0million in 2022, compared with $461\u00a0million in 2021. Approximately 31% of 2022 net written premiums was for property exposures that include risk of loss from natural catastrophes and approximately 53% was for casualty exposures from various liability risks. The remainder of approximately 16% was a combination of what we consider to be more specialized coverages that include, but are not limited to, credit risk transfer related to residential mortgages, marine and energy risks and cyber risks.   Also reported as Other are the results of Cincinnati Global, our London-based global specialty underwriter for Lloyd's Syndicate 318, which we acquired on February 28, 2019. We expect it to continue contributing to future earnings and book value growth. In 2022, we expanded opportunities for appointed independent agencies to offer their clients insurance solutions in the Lloyd\u2019s market through our insurance brokerage, CSU Producer Resources. We launched the first of several planned products through a binder authority agreement between Cincinnati Global and CSU Producer Resources, enhancing our ability to serve more of our agent\u2019s clients and bring quality business to Cincinnati Global.   Net written premiums for Cincinnati Global totaled $230 million in 2022, compared with $187 million in 2021. We continued to diversify its premiums to reduce underwriting profit volatility effects of property insurance. Most of the 2022 premiums were for U.S. and international property exposures that include risk of loss from natural catastrophes, including approximately 61% classified as direct and facultative and 22% as binder, where binding authority has been granted to various coverholders. The coverholders are mostly in the U.S., and we believe they have the ability to successfully underwrite and manage risks. The remainder, approximately 17%, was for other classes of business that include trade credit, terrorism, political violence, specie coverage for high-value portable property and contingency insurance with coverage for film and entertainment risks or event cancellation.  Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 27 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 27 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 27    Regulation The business of insurance in the United States (U.S.) is primarily regulated by state law. All of our U.S. insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled in the state of Ohio except The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company, which is domiciled in the state of Delaware. Each domestic insurance subsidiary is primarily governed by the insurance laws and regulations in its respective state of domicile. We also are subject to regulatory authorities of all states in which we write insurance. The\u00a0state laws and regulations that have the most significant effect on our insurance operations and financial reporting are discussed below. \u2022Insurance Holding Company Regulation \u2013 We are regulated as an insurance holding company system in the\u00a0respective states of domicile of our lead standard market property casualty company subsidiary and its\u00a0surplus lines insurance subsidiary. These regulations require that we annually furnish financial and\u00a0other information about the governance and operations of the individual companies within the holding company system. Information about the risks posed by any noninsurance company subsidiaries must also be disclosed. All\u00a0transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. Notice to the state insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and prior to certain material transactions between an insurer and any person or entity in its holding company group. In\u00a0addition, some of those transactions cannot be consummated without the commissioner\u2019s prior\u00a0approval. \u2022Subsidiary Dividends \u2013 The Cincinnati Insurance Company is fully owned by Cincinnati Financial Corporation. The\u00a0dividend-paying capacity of The Cincinnati Insurance Company and its fully owned subsidiaries is regulated\u00a0by the laws of the applicable state of domicile. Under these laws, our domestic insurance subsidiaries must provide a 10-day advance informational notice to the insurance commissioner for the domiciliary state prior to payment of any dividend or distribution to its shareholders. Generally, the most our domestic insurance subsidiaries can pay without prior regulatory approval is the greater of 10% of statutory capital and surplus or 100% of statutory net income for the prior calendar\u00a0year.  The domestic insurance company subsidiaries must give 30 days of notice to, and obtain prior approval from, the state insurance commissioner before the payment of an extraordinary dividend as defined by the state\u2019s\u00a0insurance code. You can find information about the dividends paid by our insurance subsidiary during 2022 in Item\u00a08, Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. \u2022Insurance Operations \u2013 All of our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to licensing and supervision by departments of insurance in the states in which they do business. The nature and extent of such regulations vary, but generally are rooted in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments. Such regulations, supervision and administration of the domestic insurance subsidiaries include: the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents and brokers; the nature and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; regulation of standard market policy forms and premium rates; policy cancellations and nonrenewals; test audit programs; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes; requirements regarding reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other matters; the nature of and limitations on dividends to policyholders and shareholders; the nature and extent of required participation in insurance guaranty funds; the involuntary assumption of hard-to-place or high-risk insurance business, primarily workers\u2019 compensation insurance; and the collection, remittance and reporting of certain taxes and fees. Our primary insurance regulators in the U.S. have adopted the Model Audit Rule for annual statutory financial reporting. This regulation closely mirrors the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on matters such as auditor independence, corporate governance and internal controls over financial reporting. The\u00a0regulation permits the audit committee of Cincinnati Financial Corporation\u2019s board of directors to also serve as the audit committee of each of our insurance subsidiaries for purposes of this regulation. \u2022Insurance Guaranty Associations \u2013 For certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants, states assess each member insurer in an amount relative to the insurer\u2019s proportionate share of business written by all member insurers in the state. While the amount of such assessments has not been material in recent years, we cannot predict the amount and timing of any future assessments or refunds on our insurance subsidiaries under these\u00a0laws. Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 28 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 28 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 28   \u2022Shared Market and Joint Underwriting Plans \u2013 Assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations are mechanisms that generally provide applicants with various basic insurance coverages when they are not available in voluntary markets. States can require participation based upon the amount of an insurance company\u2019s voluntary market share, and underwriting results related to these pools could be adverse to our\u00a0company. \u2022Statutory Accounting \u2013 For public reporting, domestic insurance companies prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, certain data also must be calculated according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC\u2019s Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. While not a substitute for any GAAP measure of performance, statutory data frequently is used by industry analysts\u00a0and other recognized reporting sources to facilitate comparisons of the performance of insurance companies. \u2022Insurance Reserves \u2013 State insurance laws require that property casualty and life insurers annually analyze the adequacy of reserves. Our appointed actuaries must submit an opinion that reserves are adequate for policy claims-paying obligations and related expenses. \u2022Investment Regulation \u2013 Insurance company investments must comply with laws and regulations pertaining to the type, quality and concentration of investments. Such laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and other qualifications.  \u2022Risk-Based Capital Requirements \u2013 The NAIC\u2019s risk-based capital (RBC)\u00a0requirements for property casualty and life insurers serve as an early warning tool for the NAIC and state regulators to identify companies that may be undercapitalized and may merit further regulatory action. The NAIC has a standard formula for annually assessing RBC. The formula for calculating RBC for property casualty companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing. The formula for calculating RBC for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance, business, asset and interest-rate risks. Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal legislation and administrative rules adopted can affect our business. Privacy laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA) are the federal laws that most affect our day-to-day operations. These apply to us because we gather and use personal nonpublic information to underwrite insurance and process claims. We also are subject to other federal laws, such as the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), anti-money laundering statute (AML), the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (NRRA), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and the rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control\u00a0(OFAC).   Title V of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank) created the Federal Insurance Office to monitor the insurance industry and gather information to identify issues or gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry that affects the United States\u2019 financial system and to recommend to the Financial Stability Oversight Council that it designate an insurer as a systemically significant entity requiring additional supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. We do not expect Dodd-Frank to result in federal oversight of our operations as a systemically significant entity. \u00a0 We do not expect to have any material effects on our expenditures, earnings or competitive position as a\u00a0result\u00a0of\u00a0compliance with any federal, state or local provisions enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the\u00a0environment. We currently do not have any material estimated capital expenditures for environmental control\u00a0facilities. \u00a0 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 29 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 29 Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2022 10-K - Page 29   We operate in limited foreign jurisdictions. Our foreign insurance subsidiary, Cincinnati Global Underwriting Ltd., based in the United Kingdom (U.K.), holds a group of companies led by our managing agency, Cincinnati Global Underwriting Agency Ltd., of Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 318, which is regulated by The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The PRA\u2019s primary objective with respect to insurers is to promote the safety and soundness of insurers for the protection of policyholders, while the FCA has three operational objectives: (i) to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; (ii) to protect and enhance the integrity of the U.K. financial system; and (iii) to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets. The PRA/FCA\u2019s Senior Managers and Certification Regime provides regulatory frameworks for standards of fitness and propriety, conduct and accountability for individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers. The PRA and FCA have also delegated certain additional regulatory responsibilities to the Council of Lloyd\u2019s. By virtue of Lloyd\u2019s international licenses, we can write business in various countries throughout the world. In each such country, we are subject to the laws and insurance regulations of that jurisdiction.  Our operations in the U.K. are further subject to regulations retained following the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union (EU). Generally, these requirements were adopted by the EU and then implemented by enabling legislation in the member countries.

Our ERM framework includes an enterprise risk management committee, which is responsible for overseeing risk activities and is comprised of senior executive-level risk owners from across the enterprise.\u00a0The risk committee's activities are supported by\u00a0a team of representatives from\u00a0business areas that focus on identifying, evaluating and developing risk plans for emerging risks. A comprehensive report is provided quarterly to our chairman, president and chief executive officer and also to our board of directors and our senior executive team, as appropriate,\u00a0on the status of risk metrics relative to identified tolerances and limits, risk assessments and risk plans. The use of operational audits, strategic plans and departmental business plans, as well as our culture of open communications and fundamental respect for our Code of Conduct, continue to help us manage risks on an ongoing basis.  We understand that a cybersecurity incident is just one example of an event that could affect our future performance. We work to keep our systems and data secure while continuing to increase our understanding of cybersecurity risk through risk management efforts and testing by third-party experts of our cybersecurity program structure and capabilities. Those efforts include blocking attempted cyber intrusions, defending against denial of service attacks, performing frequent vulnerability assessments and maintaining procedures to ensure timely notification of critical cybersecurity incidents and related disclosure controls. We also have developed procedures and reporting processes when we identify an attempted cyber intrusion to the systems of one of our independent agents. Cybersecurity matters are an important part of reporting to our executive management team, risk committee, disclosure committee and the board of directors, including its audit committee. Effects of cyberattacks can happen to any corporation and they can be significant, including additional costs for remediation, litigation and reputational damage.   Our risk management programs include a formalized risk appetite element and a risk identification and quantification process. The overall enterprise objective is to appropriately balance risk and reward to achieve an appropriate return on risk capital.\u00a0Our key risks are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, including risks related to natural catastrophes, investments and operations.  We continue to study emerging risks, including climate change risk and its potential financial effects on our results of operations and on those we insure. These effects include deterioration in the credit quality of our municipal or corporate bond portfolios and increased losses without sufficient corresponding increases in premiums. As with any risk, we seek to identify the extent of the risk exposure and possible actions to mitigate potential negative effects of risk at an enterprise\u00a0level.
