Business Overview FOX produces and delivers compelling news, sports and entertainment content through its iconic brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment, FOX Television Stations and Tubi Media Group. The Company differentiates itself in a crowded media and entertainment marketplace through its simple structure, the leadership positions of its brands and premium programming that focus on live and \u201cappointment-based\u201d content, a significant presence in major markets, and broad distribution of its content across traditional and digital platforms. Our Competitive Strengths Premium brands that resonate deeply with viewers. Under the FOX banner, we produce and distribute content through some of the world\u2019s leading and most valued brands. Our long track record of challenging the status quo emboldens us to continue making innovative decisions, disrupting norms and forming deeper relationships with audiences. FOX News Media is among the most influential and recognized news brands in the world. FOX Sports has earned a reputation for bold sports programming and, with its far-reaching presence in virtually every U.S. household, is a leading destination for live sports events and sports commentary. FOX Entertainment is renowned for its engaging primetime entertainment, including scripted dramas, leading unscripted programming and its longstanding Sunday animation block. Tubi, our leading AVOD service, attracts a young, diverse and highly engaged audience to its over 60,000 programming titles. These brands and others in our portfolio, such as our 29 owned and operated local television stations, including 18 broadcasting under the FOX brand, hold cultural significance with consumers and commercial importance for distributors and advertisers. The quality of our programming and the strength of our brands maximize the value of our content through a combination of affiliate fees and advertising sales. Leadership positions across strategically significant programming platforms. FOX enjoys a leadership position across our core news, sports and entertainment businesses. As linear television viewership declines across the industry, \"appointment-based\" programming that is the FOX hallmark remains resilient. For over 20 consecutive years, FOX News has been the top-rated national cable news channel in both Monday to Friday primetime and total day viewing, according to The Nielsen Company (\"Nielsen\"). FOX News also finished calendar year 2022 as the #1 cable network in Monday to Friday primetime and total day viewing among total viewers for the seventh consecutive year. A leader in marquee live sports broadcasts, FOX Sports programs the National Football League (\"NFL\") (including the #1 show on television, America's Game of the Week), college football (including the Big Ten Conference), Major League Baseball's (\"MLB\") Regular Season, All-Star Game and World Series, National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing (\u201cNASCAR\u201d) and other marquee cyclical events, including the Super Bowl and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (\"FIFA\") Men's and Women's World Cup. FOX Sports has secured a significant portion of its marquee rights under long-term contracts. FOX Entertainment has delivered the youngest and most diverse audience of the broadcast networks across all programming in primetime for over two decades. During the  2 2 2   2022-2023 broadcast season, FOX Entertainment featured the #1 entertainment telecast with Next Level Chef following Super Bowl LVII, the #1 broadcast drama 9-1-1, the #1 new unscripted series Special Forces: World\u2019s Toughest Test, the #1 new scripted drama in 2023 Accused, and three of the top 10 comedies on broadcast television with The Simpsons, Family Guy and Bob\u2019s Burgers. FOX Television Stations covers 18 Nielsen-designated market areas (\"DMAs\"), including 14 of the 15 largest, and was the #1 or #2 rated news provider in the hours of 5 a.m. - 9 a.m. in the majority of the markets in which it operates. Under FOX\u2019s ownership, Tubi has become one of the most relevant and fastest growing AVOD services in the country in fiscal 2023, with over 50% growth in total view time (the total number of hours watched) compared to the prior fiscal year. Tubi is part of Tubi Media Group, a division formed in fiscal 2023 to house the Company\u2019s digital platform services. Taken together, we believe our leadership positions will continue to support meaningful affiliate fee revenue growth and sustained advertising revenue, while enabling us to nimbly respond to the opportunities and challenges traditional media companies are facing relating to rapidly evolving technologies and changes in consumer behavior. Significant presence and relevance in major domestic markets. The FOX portfolio combines the range of national cable and broadcast networks and digital distribution platforms with the power of tailored local television. FOX News and FOX Business are available in over 70 million U.S. households and FOX Sports and FOX Entertainment programming on the FOX Network is available in essentially all U.S. households. Additionally, our 29 owned and operated television stations cover 18 DMAs, including 14 of the 15 largest, and maintain duopolies in 11 DMAs, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, the three largest. These stations provide balanced content of national interest with programming of note to local communities, producing approximately 1,200 hours of local news coverage each week. Tubi\u2019s ubiquitous availability both online and through its app provides broad distribution of films, episodic television programming and live local and national news content. Tubi carries over 100 local station feeds (including feeds of our owned and operated stations), covering 75 DMAs and 22 of the top 25 markets. The breadth and depth of our footprint allows us to produce and distribute our content in a cost-effective manner and share best business practices and models across regions. It also enables us to engage audiences, develop deeper consumer relationships and create more compelling product offerings. Attractive financial profile, including multiple revenue streams, strong balance sheet and other assets. We have achieved strong revenue growth and profitability in a complex industry environment over the past several years. Additionally, our strong balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest across our businesses, allocate resources toward investments in growth initiatives, take advantage of strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions across the range of media categories in which we operate, and return capital to our stockholders. We have maintained significant liquidity, ending fiscal 2023 with approximately $4.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet while returning approximately $2.3 billion of capital to our stockholders through our stock repurchase program and cash dividends during fiscal 2023. We also benefit from a tax asset that resulted from the step-up in the tax basis of our assets following the Transaction, which is expected to provide an annual cash tax benefit for many years. Additionally, our asset portfolio includes the FOX Studio Lot in Los Angeles, California. The historic lot spans over 50 acres and close to 2 million square feet of space for administration and television and film production services available to industry clients, including 15 sound stages, two broadcast studios and other production facilities. We also own an equity stake in Flutter Entertainment plc (\u201cFlutter\u201d), an online sports betting and gaming company with operations in the U.S. and internationally, and we maintain a valuable option to acquire 18.6% of FanDuel Group, a majority-owned subsidiary of Flutter. Goals and Strategies Maintain leading positions in live news, live sports and quality entertainment. We have long been a leader in news, sports and entertainment programming. We believe that building on our leading market positions is essential to our success. We are investing in our most attractive growth opportunities by allocating capital to our news, sports and entertainment properties, which we believe have distinct competitive advantages. For example, we have continued our investments in digital properties at FOX News Media, including investments in the FOX Nation subscription video-on-demand (\"SVOD\") service and the FOX Weather free advertising-supported streaming television (\u201cFAST\u201d) service. In addition, we continue to invest at FOX Sports, where fiscal 2023 highlights include a landmark rights extension with the Big Ten  3 3 3   Conference, the return of the United States Football League (the \"USFL\") for a second season and the league\u2019s expansion into additional markets. Recognizing the industry-wide changes in viewership habits, FOX Entertainment is expanding its footprint across owned and unscripted content. FOX Entertainment is investing in more co-production arrangements and owns a stake in each new series that premiered on the FOX Network during the 2022-2023 broadcast season. In addition, our production companies such as MarVista Entertainment and the Studio Ramsay Global production venture with Gordon Ramsay produce content for FOX as well as third parties, which reduces our reliance on third-party content providers. We also continue to invest in content, technology and marketing at Tubi to attract new viewers and retain Tubi\u2019s existing audience. In fiscal 2023, Tubi expanded its content library through the premiere of over 100 new original titles and the launch of over 100 sports, entertainment and local news channels, for a total of nearly 250 sports, entertainment and local news channels on the platform. We believe continuing to provide compelling news, sports and entertainment programming across platforms will increase audience engagement and drive growth across our distribution, affiliate and advertising relationships. Increase revenue growth through the continued delivery of high quality, premium and valuable content. With a focused portfolio of assets, we create and produce high quality programming that delivers value for our viewers, our affiliates and our advertisers. We intend to continue to generate appropriate value for our content. Additionally, we expect our internal production capabilities and co-production arrangements will facilitate growth by enabling us to directly manage the economics and programming decisions of our broadcast network, stations group and Tubi. We also believe our unique ability to deliver \"appointment-based\" viewing and audiences at scale, along with innovative advertising platforms, delivers substantial value to our advertising customers, and the unique nature of our \"appointment-based\" content positions us to maintain and even grow audiences during a time of increasing consumer fragmentation. Expand our digital distribution offerings and direct engagement with consumers, increasing complementary sources of revenues. The availability of our key networks on all major virtual MVPD services reflects the strength of our brands and the \"must-have\" nature of our content. We are also cultivating and growing direct interactions between FOX brands and consumers outside traditional linear television. For example, Tubi, which we acquired in fiscal 2020, provides us with a wholly-owned digital platform to access a wider digital audience and further the reach of our content. Tubi continues to experience significant growth in total view time across a library of over 60,000 titles, as well as key FOX entertainment, news and sports programming, and it streamed approximately 6.8 billion hours of content over the course of the fiscal year (a record for the platform) to a young, diverse and highly engaged audience advertisers are eager to reach. FOX News Media operates a number of digital businesses, including FOX News Digital, which attracts the highest multiplatform time spent in the news category, along with the FOX Nation SVOD service, which offers U.S. consumers a variety of on-demand content (including original programming), and FOX Weather, which offers local, regional and national weather reporting in addition to live programming. Additionally, FOX Television Stations operates a portfolio of digital businesses, including the FLX digital advertising platform and the LiveNOW from FOX, FOX Locals and FOX Soul FAST services, in addition to distributing its local news programming on Tubi and across a range of third-party platforms.

(a) VHF television stations transmit on Channels 2 through 13 and UHF television stations on Channels 14 through 36. The Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\") applies a discount (the \u201cUHF Discount\"), which attributes only 50% of the television households in a local television market to the audience reach of a UHF television station for purposes of calculating whether that station\u2019s owner complies with the national station ownership cap imposed by FCC regulations and by statute; in making this calculation, only the station\u2019s RF Broadcast Channel is considered. In a duopoly market, both stations must be UHF for the discount to apply. In addition, the coverage of two commonly owned stations in the same market is counted only once. The percentages listed are rounded and do not take into account the UHF Discount.

The FOX Network The FOX Network is a premier national television broadcast network, renowned for disrupting legacy broadcasters with powerful sports programming and appealing primetime entertainment. The FOX Network regularly delivers approximately 16 hours of weekly primetime programming to 209 local market affiliates, including 18 stations owned and operated by the Company, covering approximately 99.9% of all U.S. television households, according to Nielsen. The FOX Network primetime lineup is intended to appeal primarily to the 18 to 49 year old audience, the demographic group that advertisers seek to reach most often, with particular success in the 18 to 34 year old audience. The FOX Network has ranked among the top two networks in the 18 to 34 year old audience for the past 28 broadcast seasons. During the 2022-2023 broadcast season, the FOX Network ranked #1 in the 18 to 49 year old audience and #1 across key advertiser demographic groups, including the 18 to 34 year old audience (based on Nielsen\u2019s live+7 ratings). The FOX Network programming ranked #1 among all broadcast network primetime programming for the 2022-2023 broadcast season in the 18 to 49 year old audience (based on Nielsen\u2019s commercial+7 ratings). The median age of the FOX Network viewer is 60 years, as compared to 63 years for ABC Television Network (\u201cABC\u201d), 64 years for NBC and 66 years for CBS. \u2022FOX Sports. A significant component of FOX Network programming consists of sports programming, with the FOX Network providing to its affiliates during the 2022-2023 broadcast season live coverage of the NFL, including the premier NFC rights package and America's Game of the Week (the #1 show on television). The FOX Network also provides live coverage of MLB (including the post-season and the World Series), college football and basketball, the NASCAR Cup Series (including the Daytona 500), MLS, the USFL and weekly episodes of WWE Friday Night SmackDown. In certain years, FOX Sports broadcasts the Super Bowl, the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. FOX Sports entered into an expanded 11-year media rights agreement with the NFL in fiscal 2021 that extended FOX Sports' coverage of NFC games, created new and exclusive holiday games on the FOX Network, and expanded FOX's digital rights to enable future direct-to-consumer opportunities as well as NFL-related programming on Tubi.  \u2022FOX Entertainment. FOX Entertainment delivers high-quality scripted, unscripted, animated and live event content. FOX Entertainment primetime programming during the 2022-2023 broadcast season  9 9 9   featured such scripted series as 9-1-1, 9-1-1: Lone Star, Accused, The Cleaning Lady, Alert: Missing Persons Unit, and the FOX Entertainment-owned comedy Animal Control; animated series, including The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, Family Guy and The Great North; and unscripted series, such as Next Level Chef and Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Food Stars from Studio Ramsay Global (FOX's co-owned production company with Gordon Ramsay), The Masked Singer, I Can See Your Voice, LEGO Masters, Special Forces: World's Toughest Test, Farmer Wants a Wife and investigative report specials from FOX-owned TMZ. During the 2022-2023 broadcast season, FOX Entertainment featured the #1 entertainment telecast with Next Level Chef following Super Bowl LVII, the #1 broadcast drama 9-1-1, the #1 new unscripted series Special Forces: World\u2019s Toughest Test, the #1 new scripted drama in 2023 Accused, and three of the top 10 comedies on broadcast television with The Simpsons, Family Guy and Bob\u2019s Burgers. The FOX Network obtains national sports programming through license agreements with professional or collegiate sports leagues or organizations, including long-term agreements with the NFL, MLB, college football and basketball conferences, NASCAR, FIFA, UEFA, Concacaf, CONMEBOL and WWE. Entertainment programming is obtained from major television studios, including 20th Television (formerly known as Twentieth Century Fox Television and which is owned by Disney), Sony Pictures Television and Warner Bros. Television, and independent television production companies pursuant to license agreements. The terms of these agreements generally provide the FOX Network with the right to acquire broadcast rights to a television series for a minimum of four seasons. Entertainment programming is also provided by the Company's in-house production companies.  The FOX Network provides programming to affiliates in accordance with affiliation agreements of varying durations, which grant to each affiliate the right to broadcast network television programming on the affiliated station. Such agreements typically run three or more years and have staggered expiration dates. These affiliation agreements require affiliates to the FOX Network to carry the FOX Network programming in all time periods in which the FOX Network programming is offered to those affiliates, subject to certain exceptions stated in the affiliation agreements. Tubi Tubi is a leading AVOD service that is available on multiple digital platforms in the United States and select international regions. The business is part of the Tubi Media Group division formed in fiscal 2023 to house the Company's digital platform services. Tubi offers a content library of over 60,000 titles from over 400 content partners, including every major Hollywood studio, and a growing number of new original titles. Tubi also features key FOX content, such as The Masked Singer, Next Level Chef and Divorce Court, as well as sports programming and live local and national news content. In addition to its on-demand library, Tubi offers nearly 250 sports, entertainment and local news linear streaming channels. These include channels featuring FOX Entertainment's The Masked Singer, TMZ and Studio Ramsay Global\u2019s Gordon Ramsay and feeds from over 100 local television stations (including FOX's owned and operated stations), covering 75 DMAs and 22 of the top 25 markets. As of June 2023, Tubi is available on 33 digital platforms, including connected television devices, and online at www.tubitv.com. In fiscal 2023, the service generated approximately 6.8 billion hours of total view time (the total number of hours watched). Tubi enables the Company's advertising partners to access a substantial, incremental digital audience. As of May 2023, the median age of Tubi\u2019s audience is approximately 10 years younger than the median age of broadcast television viewers. Tubi\u2019s viewers are diverse and multicultural with a majority of its audience not subscribing to traditional or virtual MVPD services.  Entertainment Programming Production The Company also produces entertainment programming for its own traditional and digital entertainment platforms and for third parties. FOX\u2019s entertainment production companies include two companies acquired in fiscal 2022: MarVista Entertainment, a global entertainment studio that produces and distributes movies and other content for Tubi and third party networks and digital platforms, and TMZ, which produces daily syndicated magazine programs, broadcast and other television specials and other content for distribution on traditional and digital platforms, including FOX Television Stations, Tubi, FOX Nation and other digital properties. The Company has also formed a co-owned production company with Gordon Ramsay called Studio Ramsay Global  10 10 10   that develops, produces and distributes culinary and lifestyle programming such as Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Food Stars and Next Level Chef for FOX, Kitchen Commando for Tubi and other programs for global markets. Fox Alternative Entertainment is a full-service production studio that develops and produces unscripted and alternative programming primarily for the FOX Network, including The Masked Singer, I Can See Your Voice and Name That Tune. Bento Box Entertainment, an animation production company, produces programming for cable and broadcast networks (including programming such as Krapopolis, Bob's Burgers and The Great North for the FOX Network) and digital platforms. Digital Distribution The Company's Television segment also distributes programming through FOX-branded websites, apps, podcasts and social media accounts and licenses programming for distribution through MVPDs' websites and apps. The Company's websites and apps include FOX.com, FOXSports.com, TMZ.com, the FOX Sports app and the TMZ app and provide live and/or on-demand streaming of FOX Network shows and programming from broadcast stations affiliated with the FOX Network. Other digital properties offering Television segment programming and other content include Tubi and the TMZ FAST service. FOX Television Stations distributes content across websites and mobile apps associated with the stations, Tubi, a range of third-party platforms, and FOX Television Station\u2019s FAST services. These services include LiveNOW from FOX, which offers live news coverage; FOX Soul, a service dedicated to the African American viewer that features original and syndicated programming; and FOX Locals, a group of FAST services that offer live and recorded content from over 15 FOX-owned and operated local television stations. The Company's FAST services are distributed across multiple devices and platforms, including traditional and virtual MVPDs, Tubi, connected TV device platforms and other digital platforms.  MyNetworkTV The programming distribution service, Master Distribution Service, Inc. (branded as MyNetworkTV), distributes two hours per night, Monday through Friday, of off-network programming from syndicators to its over 180 licensee stations, including 10 stations owned and operated by the Company, and is available to approximately 94.9% of U.S. households as of June 30, 2023. Competition The network television broadcasting business is highly competitive. The FOX Network (with respect to both its sports and entertainment programming), MyNetworkTV and Tubi compete for audiences, programming and advertising revenue with a variety of competing media, including other broadcast television networks; cable television systems and networks; direct-to-consumer streaming and on-demand platforms and services; mobile, gaming and social media platforms; audio programming; and print and other media. In addition, the FOX Network and MyNetworkTV compete with other broadcast networks and programming distribution services to secure affiliations or station agreements with independently owned television stations in markets across the U.S. ABC, NBC and CBS each broadcast a significantly greater number of hours of programming than the FOX Network and, accordingly, may be able to designate or change time periods in which programming is to be broadcast with greater flexibility than the FOX Network. Technological developments are also continuing to affect competition within the broadcast television marketplace. Our entertainment programming production businesses compete with other content creators for creative talent, new content ideas, intellectual property and the distribution of their content. Each of the stations owned and operated by FOX Television Stations also competes for advertising revenues with other television stations, radio and cable systems in its respective market area, along with other advertising media, including direct-to-consumer streaming and on-demand platforms and services; mobile, gaming and social media platforms; newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising and direct mail. All of the stations owned and operated by FOX Television Stations are located in highly competitive markets. Additional factors that affect the competitive position of each of the television stations include management experience, authorized power and assigned frequency of that station. Competition for sales of broadcast advertising time is based primarily on the anticipated and actually delivered size and demographic characteristics of audiences as determined by various rating services, price, the time of day when the advertising is to be broadcast, competition from the other broadcast networks, cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite television, services and digital media and general economic conditions. Competition for audiences is based primarily on  11 11 11   the selection of programming, the acceptance of which is dependent on the reaction of the viewing public, which is often difficult to predict. Other, Corporate and Eliminations The Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment consists primarily of the FOX Studio Lot, Credible, corporate overhead costs and intracompany eliminations. FOX Studio Lot FOX owns the FOX Studio Lot in Los Angeles, California. The historic lot is located on over 50 acres of land and has over 1.85 million square feet of space for both administration and production and post-production services available to service a wide array of industry clients, including 15 sound stages, two broadcast studios, theaters and screening rooms, editing rooms and other television and film production facilities. The FOX Studio Lot provides two primary revenue streams \u2014 the lease of a portion of the office space to Disney and other third parties and the operation of studio facilities for third party productions, which until 2026 will predominantly be Disney productions. Credible The Company holds 66% of the equity in Credible, which operates consumer finance and insurance marketplaces in the U.S. Credible\u2019s offerings provide consumers personalized product and rate options for a range of financial products, including student loans, personal loans, mortgages and insurance policies from multiple consumer lending and insurance providers. Credible is part of the Tubi Media Group division. Investments Flutter The Company holds an equity interest in Flutter, an online sports betting and gaming company with operations in the U.S. and internationally. The Company owns approximately 4.3 million ordinary shares, which represents approximately 2.5% of Flutter as of June 30, 2023. In addition, subject to certain conditions and applicable gaming regulatory approvals, FOX Sports holds a 10-year call option expiring in December 2030 to acquire an 18.6% equity interest in Flutter's majority-owned subsidiary, FanDuel Group (\"FanDuel\"). The FanDuel option was the subject of arbitration proceedings, which concluded during fiscal 2023 and determined the price payable of $3.7 billion plus an annual escalator of 5%. As of June 30, 2023, the option price is approximately $4 billion. FOX has no obligation to commit capital towards this opportunity unless and until it exercises the option. In addition, Flutter cannot pursue an initial public offering for FanDuel without FOX's consent or approval from the arbitrator. Government Regulation The Communications Act and FCC Regulation The television broadcast industry in the U.S. is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various agencies, including the FCC. The FCC regulates television broadcasting, and certain aspects of the operations of cable, satellite and other electronic media that compete with broadcasting, pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cCommunications Act\u201d). The introduction of new laws and regulations or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws and regulations could have a negative impact on the operations, prospects and financial performance of the Company. Broadcast Licenses. The Communications Act permits the operation of television broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The Company, through its subsidiaries, holds broadcast licenses in connection with its ownership and operation of television stations. Under the Communications Act, television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years. Generally, the FCC renews broadcast licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations  12 12 12   which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. The current renewal cycle for FOX Television Stations' FCC applications for its full power broadcast licenses began in 2020 and all license renewal applications for the current cycle have been filed. One of the pending applications has been opposed by a third party. Ownership Regulations. Under the FCC\u2019s national television ownership rule, one party may own television stations with a collective national audience reach of not more than 39% of all U.S. television households, subject to the UHF discount. Under the UHF discount, a UHF television station is attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market for purposes of calculating national audience reach. In December 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying, retaining or eliminating the 39% national television audience reach limitation (including the UHF discount). If the FCC determines in the future to eliminate the UHF discount and the national television audience reach limitation is not eliminated or modified, the Company\u2019s ability to acquire television stations in additional markets may be negatively affected. The Company is also subject to other communications laws and regulations relating to ownership. For example, FCC dual network rules prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks \u2014 FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC \u2014 from being under common ownership or control. In addition, under the Communications Act, no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if more than 25% of the corporation\u2019s stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, their representatives, or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. This ownership limit can be waived if the FCC finds it to be in the public interest. The FCC could review the Company\u2019s compliance with the foreign ownership regulations in connection with its consideration of FOX Television Stations\u2019 license renewal applications. The Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to take action to prevent, cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold, including: refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a non-U.S. stockholder; voiding a transfer of common stock to a non-U.S. stockholder; suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a non-U.S. stockholder; or redeeming common stock held by a non-U.S. stockholder. Carriage and Content Regulations. FCC regulations require each television broadcaster to elect, at three-year intervals, either to require carriage of its signal by traditional MVPDs in the station\u2019s market or to negotiate the terms through which that broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the traditional MVPDs within its market, which we refer to as retransmission consent. FOX Television Stations have historically elected retransmission consent for all of their owned and operated stations, and the Company has been compensated as a result. Federal legislation limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during programming originally designed for children 12 years of age and younger to 10 \u00bd minutes per hour during the weekend and 12 minutes per hour during the week. In addition, FCC regulations generally require television stations to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week of programming, which, among other requirements, must serve, as a \"significant purpose,\" the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under. Under FCC rules, one of the three hours per week may air on a television's station's multicast stream(s); the other two hours must air on the primary programming stream. A television station found not to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions, including monetary fines and the possible non-renewal of its license. The FCC continues to strictly enforce its regulations concerning indecency, sponsorship identification, political advertising, children's television, environmental concerns, emergency alerting and information, equal employment opportunity, technical operating matters and antenna tower maintenance. Federal law authorizes the FCC to impose fines of up to $479,945 per incident for violation of the prohibition against indecent and profane broadcasts, and the FCC may also impose fines or revoke licenses for serious or multiple violations of the indecency prohibition and/or its other regulations. Modifications to the Company\u2019s programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on the competitive position of FOX Television Stations and the FOX Network. If indecency regulation is extended to Internet or cable and satellite programming, and such extension was found to be constitutional, some of the Company\u2019s other programming services could be subject to additional regulation that might adversely affect subscription and viewership levels. Because FCC complaints are confidential, there may be pending nonpublic complaints alleging non-compliance and it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such complaints. 13 13 13   In addition, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has increased its focus on unfair and deceptive advertising practices, particularly with respect to social media marketing. Both FCC and FTC rules and guidance require marketers to clearly and conspicuously disclose whenever there has been payment for a marketing message or when there is a material connection between an advertiser and a product endorser. FCC rules also require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming. In addition, Federal law requires affiliates of the four largest broadcast networks in the 80 largest markets to carry a specified minimum number of hours of primetime or children\u2019s programming per calendar quarter with audio descriptions, i.e., a verbal description of key visual elements inserted into natural pauses in the audio and broadcast over a separate audio channel. The same statute requires programming that was captioned on television to retain captions when distributed via Internet Protocol apps or services. In addition, FCC regulations govern various aspects of the agreements between networks and affiliated broadcast stations, including a mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures, periodic reporting conditions, short-term license renewals and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of license. Violation of FTC-imposed obligations can result in enforcement actions, litigation, consent decrees and, ultimately, substantial monetary fines. Broadcast Transmission Standard. In November 2017, the FCC adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the \"Next Generation\" broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also referred to as \"ATSC 3.0\" or \"NEXTGEN TV\". FOX Television Stations is actively building out ATSC 3.0 facilities and is participating in various ATSC 3.0 testing with other broadcasters, but it is too early to predict the impact of this technical standard on the Company's operations. In June 2020, the FCC adopted a Declaratory Ruling and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking declaring that local and national ownership restrictions do not apply to non-video services. In June 2022, the FCC issued a Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that raises a number of questions that could impact the adoption and roll-out of both video and non-video ATSC 3.0 services, as well as the broadcast requirements for the ATSC 1.0 standard. Privacy and Information Regulation The laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving, particularly as they relate to the Company's digital businesses. Federal and state laws and regulations affecting the Company's online services, websites, and other business activities include: the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits websites and online services from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent; the Video Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the knowing disclosure of information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials from a \"video tape service provider;\" the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which restricts certain marketing communications, such as text messages and calls, without explicit consent; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the collection, handling, disclosure, and use of certain personal information by companies that offer consumers financial products or services, imposes notice obligations, and provides certain individual rights regarding the use and disclosure of certain information; and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\") (as amended by the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\")), which imposes broad obligations on the collection, use, handling and disclosure of personal information of California residents. For example, subject to certain exceptions, the CCPA provides individual rights for Californians, such as the right to access, delete, correct, and restrict the \"sale\" or \"sharing\" of personal information, including in connection with targeted advertising. Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have similar privacy laws that have or will become effective in 2023.  A number of privacy and data security bills that address the collection, retention and use of personal information, breach notification requirements and cybersecurity that would impose additional obligations on businesses, including in connection with targeted advertising, are pending or have been adopted at the state and federal level. For example, the CPRA, which generally became effective on January 1, 2023, creates a new  14 14 14   state privacy protection agency, expands individual rights, and introduces new requirements for businesses, among other things. Several of these matters are subject to additional rulemaking. Other states have passed or introduced similar privacy legislation, including Virginia, Colorado, Utah, Connecticut, Iowa, Indiana, and Tennessee. In addition, the FTC and state attorneys general and other regulators have made privacy and data security an enforcement focus. The FTC also has initiated a rulemaking proceeding to explore rules concerning the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal information. Other federal and state laws and regulations that could impact our businesses also may be adopted, such as those relating to minors, tailored advertising and its measurement, and oversight of user-generated content. Foreign jurisdictions also have implemented and continue to introduce new privacy and data security laws and regulations, which apply to certain of the Company\u2019s operations. It is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof and could result in the violation of these new laws and regulations. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, in particular, regulates the collection, use and security of personal data and restricts the trans-border flow of such data. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, China, and Mexico, also have enacted data protection legislation. The Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the design and operation of digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs. These laws and regulations and their interpretation are subject to change, and could result in increased compliance costs, claims, financial penalties for noncompliance, changes to business practices, including with respect to tailored advertising, or otherwise impact the Company\u2019s business. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in significant monetary fines and other penalties, private litigation, require us to expend significant resources to defend, remedy and/or address, and harm our reputation, even if we are not ultimately responsible for the violation. Consumer Finance Laws and Regulations Credible operates consumer finance and insurance marketplaces that market and provide services in heavily regulated industries across the United States. As a result, Credible is subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations. These include the laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information described above and the following: \u2022the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or \u201cRESPA,\u201d and similar state laws, and federal and state unfair and deceptive acts and practices, or \u201cUDAAP,\u201d laws and regulations, which place restrictions on the manner in which consumer loans and insurance products are marketed and originated and the amount and nature of fees that may be charged or paid to Credible by lenders, insurance carriers and real estate professionals for providing or obtaining consumer loan and insurance requests; \u2022the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which, among other things, imposes requirements related to mortgage disclosures; and \u2022federal and state licensing laws, such as the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, or \u201cSAFE Act,\u201d which establishes minimum standards for the licensing and regulation of mortgage loan originators, and state insurance licensing laws. Intellectual Property The Company\u2019s intellectual property assets include copyrights in television programming and other publications, websites and technologies; trademarks, trade dress, service marks, logos, slogans, sound marks, design rights, symbols, characters, names, titles and trade names, domain names; patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, trade secrets and know how; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The Company derives value from these assets through the production, distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to domestic and international cable and satellite television services, video-on-demand services, operation of websites, and through the sale of products, such as collectible merchandise, apparel, books and publications, among others. 15 15 15   The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property, relying upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. There can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Policing unauthorized use of the Company\u2019s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Company\u2019s intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of approaches, including offering legitimate market alternatives, deploying digital rights management technologies, pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company\u2019s intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Even if not valid, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations. Human Capital Resources Our workforce is the creative, strategic and operational engine of FOX's success, and we are committed to developing and supporting our employees. We aim to develop our human capital by recruiting a talented and diverse workforce, offering competitive compensation and benefits, fostering a healthy work-life balance, providing growth and development opportunities, protecting health and safety, fostering workplace civility and inclusion and encouraging our employees to have an impact in their communities.  As of June 30, 2023, we had approximately 10,400 full-time employees. In the ordinary course of our business and consistent with industry practice, we also employ freelance and temporary workers who provide important production and broadcast support services. The vast majority of our workforce is based in the United States, and a portion is unionized. We have posted on our corporate website our Employment Information Report (EEO-1), showing the race, ethnicity and gender of our U.S. employees at https://www.foxcorporation.com/eeo-1-data. FOX\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility Report, also posted on our website at www.foxcorporation.com, provides a detailed review of our human capital programs and achievements. Our key human capital initiatives include: Recruitment and Diversity We are committed to diversity from the very top of the Company. Our Board of Directors requires that minority and female candidates are presented for consideration with each Director vacancy. We believe that the more voices in the room and the more diverse the experiences of our colleagues, the better FOX\u2019s internal culture and external programming are. Our diversity enables us to be more reflective of the audiences we reach and enhances our ability to create news, sports, and entertainment programming that serves all viewers across the country. FOX lists job openings internally and externally because we believe this is one of the best tools to reach the widest and most diverse pool of candidates. We include the salary range in job postings to promote pay transparency and further pay equity. We also collaborate with professional organizations that offer FOX access to talent at recruiting events and conventions. These organizations include: \u2022Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA) \u2022National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2022National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ) \u2022Native American Journalists Association (NAJA) \u2022NLGJA: The Association of LGBTQ+ Journalists \u2022Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) 16 16 16   We also offer paid internships to build a diverse pipeline of early-career talent and emerging leaders. The FOX Internship Program offers students an exciting opportunity to gain practical experience, participating in real-world projects and seminars on the media industry, technology and professional development. This internship program, which runs for 8-10 weeks three times per year, welcomed over 475 students in calendar year 2022. We are proud that our internship program was listed on Vault's 2022 and 2023 \"100 Best Internships,\" and it was the 2023 Winner of the Interns 2 Pros Internship Program of the Year (for excellence in its 2022 program). We also partner with the Emma Bowen Foundation, the T. Howard Foundation, the International Television and Radio Society, Sports Biz Careers, NAB Emerson Coleman Fellowship, Pathway at UCLA Extension and the Entertainment Industry College Outreach Program to provide media internships for promising students. In addition, FOX has developed and implemented a number of internal early career training programs designed to provide outstanding individuals with workforce skills and professional development opportunities. These programs build the pipeline of our next generation of leaders, many of whom are from underrepresented backgrounds. Examples include: \u2022FOX Ad Sales Training: Initiated in 2021, this rotational program aims to attract, develop, and retain early career talent. Through exposure to various functions within Ad Sales, the program develops professional skills of promising individuals recruited from outside FOX. \u2022FOX Alternative Entertainment (\u201cFAE\u201d) FASTRACK: This highly selective accelerated producers\u2019 initiative is designed to nurture producers with diverse backgrounds and life experiences, and create a pipeline for new, behind-the-camera talent on FAE series. Launched in 2020, the program places candidates as associate producers on production teams across various FAE-produced shows to provide valuable exposure to many facets of production. \u2022FOX News Media Digital Rotational Program: Launched in 2021, this program strives to identify high potential talent from diverse backgrounds with a passion for the FOX News Media brand. The goal is to find staff placement for the individuals who complete the one-year rotational program across three key departments for four months each and have proven themselves to be integral members of the FOX News Media Digital team. \u2022FOX News Multimedia Reporters Training Program: This program places talent from diverse backgrounds in multimedia reporter roles across the country, where they shoot, report, edit and produce their own high-end content across FOX News platforms. Through daily guidance and feedback from management, we challenge and enable the talent to continually hone their journalistic skills. \u2022FOX Sports Professional Development Program: This program prepares production team leaders with skills for the unique sports production environment, such as communication and influence in the control room under short deadlines. \u2022FOX Television Stations Sales Training Program: This program was created to develop and mentor the next generation of diverse and motivated sales professionals for FOX Television Stations. Trainees participate in both intensive classroom study of all aspects of the television station advertising sales business and shadowing of FOX Television Stations sales account executives. \u2022FOX Writers Incubator Initiative: This FOX Entertainment program, which welcomed its first class in March 2022, nurtures and trains talented writers with diverse voices, backgrounds and life experiences. Writers work intensively on their scripts with the support of established writers, executives, directors and producers across all genres (comedy, drama, animation, etc.). Employee Compensation and Benefits We are proud to invest in our people through competitive pay and comprehensive benefits designed to attract, motivate and retain our talent. Providing equal pay for equal work, without regard to race, gender or other protected characteristics, is an imperative at FOX. We link our more senior employees' pay to corporate performance through discretionary annual incentive compensation awards. Other employees may be eligible for equity awards or other long-term incentives depending on their business unit and level/role. FOX also provides generous benefits that support the health, wellness and financial stability of our employees and their families. Full-time employees are eligible for medical insurance through a choice of several  17 17 17   plans, in which employees also may enroll family members, including domestic partners and their children. Many employees benefit from the convenience of covered telemedicine visits as well as virtual primary care services. In addition, we provide vision and dental insurance, which includes coverage for adult orthodontic care. Our coverage is generous, with employee contributions and costs more favorable than national averages according to a 2022 Mercer LLC survey. Eligible employees may participate in flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, and qualified transportation expense accounts. We also provide employees with a health advocate service, with experts who support employees and their eligible family members in navigating a wide range of health and insurance-related issues. Full-time employees are eligible to receive paid company holidays, floating holidays, vacation, sick and safe time, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, full salary replacement for up to 26 weeks of short-term disability, basic long-term disability insurance, charitable gift matching, cybersecurity and malware protection for personal devices and an employee assistance program that offers onsite counseling in our New York and Los Angeles worksites, as well as smoking cessation and weight management programs. The FOX 401(k) Savings Plan provides employees with a company contribution, and it offers a company match, Roth and post-tax contribution options and catch-up contributions. Freelance employees who work a minimum number of hours are also eligible for a medical, dental, and vision plan, as well as our FOX 401(k) Savings Plan and the health advocate service. Finally, FOX also offers employees group discounts in various voluntary benefits such as critical illness insurance, group universal life insurance, auto and home insurance, access to legal services, pet insurance, supplemental long-term disability insurance and student loan refinancing. Work-Life Balance and Workplace Flexibility We believe offering our employees the tools necessary for a healthy work-life balance empowers them to thrive in our modern workforce. To that end, FOX allows eligible individuals the opportunity to work on a partially remote (i.e., \u201chybrid\u201d) or fully remote basis in appropriate circumstances. We support these working arrangements by deploying online collaboration tools, offering e-learning courses on effective remote work, providing reasonable office supplies and reimbursing business expenses. The Company also reimburses employees who work on a fully remote basis with a monthly stipend for business expenses (including mobile or other devices, Internet and electricity). Where appropriate, we provide technology and mobile communication devices, tailored to employee duties. Our parental leave policy allows eligible new parents to bond with their children for a substantial period with full pay, and our workplaces have lactation rooms for our new mothers. We provide onsite subsidized childcare to full-time employees at the Los Angeles FOX Child Care Center. In addition, we offer up to 40 days of backup child, adult, elder and return-to-work care. Starting in 2022, we added backup pet care and online academic help with homework and tutors for all ages. In addition, we have onsite fitness centers in our New York and Los Angeles worksites. Learning and Development FOX offers employees multiple learning and development programs, including tuition reimbursement, management and leadership development, online and on-demand e-learning, live webinars and assessment tools. Our annual MentorMatch program provides junior employees with the tools and resources to grow their careers through relationship-building and networking. We also identify key individuals for ongoing talent management, retention and succession planning. Within FOX News Media and FOX Television Stations, we deliver specialized training on the First Amendment, defamation, privacy, infringement and other newsgathering and reporting topics to educate employees on these principles and provide advice on best practices. Health and Safety FOX is committed to protecting the health, safety and working environment of our employees, clients and neighbors. Our Environment, Health and Safety Program manages risks by implementing proactive, practical and feasible controls into daily work activities, as appropriate. Employees receive health and safety training orientations and have access to several workplace safety programs and resources. The program works to  18 18 18   continuously improve performance through preventive measures, as well as efforts to correct hazards or dangerous conditions and minimize the environmental impact of our activities.  Moreover, FOX has a Global Security team that oversees the Company\u2019s security and emergency response efforts as well as emergency planning and preparedness. The team proactively monitors, reports and responds to potential and actual threats to people, physical assets, property, as well as productions and events, using a number of tools, including advanced technology, active training programs and risk assessment and management processes. Workplace Civility and Inclusion Trust begins in the workplace every single day. We are committed to fostering a working environment of trust for our colleagues, in which people do their best work. Harassment, discrimination, retaliation and threats to health and safety all undermine our working environment of trust and make it harder for people to excel. Therefore, it is our policy to provide a safe work environment free from this or any other unlawful conduct. Creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination and harassment begins at the highest leadership level of the Company and we have focused on embedding this commitment throughout our policies and practices. The FOX Standards of Business Conduct and the Preventing Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation Policy, which are posted on our website, create our framework for addressing complaints and taking remedial measures as needed. These policies offer multiple complaint channels, including a third-party managed hotline that allows for anonymous reporting of concerns. In addition, all new hires must complete training on the Preventing Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation Policy, as well as compliance and business ethics, and existing employees must complete the training periodically. FOX also has several employee-driven Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) formed around shared identity, interests or pursuits for the purpose of advancing careers, encouraging a more respectful workplace community and fostering a sense of belonging. They include: \u2022ABLE \u2013 promotes an inclusive environment and culture for our colleagues with disabilities through advocacy and allyship \u2022ACE (Asian Community Exchange) \u2013 serves Asian Americans at FOX by advancing our members, championing our stories and empowering our communities \u2022BLK+ \u2013 celebrates our Black colleagues and seeks to build community through programming and professional development while standing in solidarity with our allies \u2022HOLA (Hispanic Organization for Leadership and Advancement) \u2013 develops Hispanic leaders, enriches FOX\u2019s diverse culture and drives positive impact \u2022PRIDE \u2013 cultivates community among FOX\u2019s LGBTQ+ colleagues and allies, supports causes important to the LGBTQ+ community \u2022VETS \u2013 committed to the community of veterans, current service members, military supporters and military spouses employed at FOX by embracing our four core values \u2013 Community, Appreciation, Connection & Education \u2022WiT (Women in Tech) \u2013 attracts, advances and empowers women technologists and amplifies their impact at FOX \u2022WOMEN@FOX \u2013 creates the space for developing female leadership at all levels and fostering a culture where all women thrive Maintaining a work environment where employees can thrive, advance and feel included is one of our top priorities at FOX.

Nowhere is that more evident than through the commitment and involvement of our colleagues who volunteer their time, share their skills and contribute to worthy causes through our philanthropic program, FOX Forward. Through volunteer opportunities and service projects, FOX employees support community groups, veteran service organizations, local schools and families in need, and we encourage our colleagues to donate their time and resources to change-making organizations. Over the course of fiscal 2023, across all FOX businesses, our giving programs generated over $9 million in impact to multiple communities.  During the fiscal year, FOX and its employees supported military veterans, first responders and their families by partnering with Purple Heart Homes, U.S.VETS to champion their Make Camo Your Cause campaign and in an effort to leave a positive imprint in the Super Bowl LVII host city, we made a multi-year commitment to the Pat Tillman Veterans Center at Arizona State University to provide scholarship funding and mental health resources for student veterans. FOX continued to serve as an Annual Disaster Giving Program partner for the American Red Cross, while also making three additional donations of $1 million each to the Hurricane Ian and Southern and Midwest Tornadoes & Storms Relief Campaigns as well as ongoing humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine.  As a part of our wider \"FOX For Students\" initiative, FOX became a Founding Partner of the Roybal Film and Television Production Magnet Fund. This investment provides historically underrepresented college- and career-ready students with the resources and experiences to pursue below-the-line careers in the film and television industry.  FOX holiday giving programs raised over $525,000 in November and December of 2022 for non-profit organizations across the country, including Team Rubicon, Angel City Sports, Feeding America and Toys for Tots, providing meals, coats, and holiday gifts for those in need. As part of the Company\u2019s commitment to give back to the communities in which its employees live and work, our FOX Giving program matches contributions made by regular full-time employees to eligible non-profit organizations, dollar for dollar, up to a total of $1,000 per fiscal year when submitted through the FOX Giving platform. We also track and reward employee volunteer hours with the opportunity to earn up to $1,000 per year that employees may direct to charities through the program. Over the course of the fiscal year, across all FOX businesses, contributions through FOX Giving exceeded $1 million.  Additionally, FOX provides invaluable in-kind support through public service announcements and editorial coverage for non-profit organizations such as Big Brothers, Big Sisters, The National Alliance on Mental Illness, Common Goal and the Elizabeth Dole Foundation, while also creating additional impact in our communities through efforts such as FOX Sports Supports\u2019 Gamechanger Fund, FOX Entertainment\u2019s #TVForAll, FOX Television Stations' Holiday Community Giving Campaigns and FOX News Media\u2019s support of the Police Athletic League NYC, Tunnel to Towers and Save Our Allies. 20 20 20   ", "time": "00:00:03"}
