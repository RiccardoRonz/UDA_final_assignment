{"cik": 92380, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business  Company Overview   Southwest Airlines Co. (the \"Company\" or \"Southwest\") operates Southwest Airlines, a major passenger airline that provides scheduled air transportation in the United States and near-international markets. Southwest commenced service on June 18, 1971, with three Boeing 737 aircraft serving three Texas cities: Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. At December 31, 2022, Southwest had a total of 770 Boeing 737 aircraft in its fleet and served 121 destinations in 42 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and ten near-international countries: Mexico, Jamaica, The Bahamas, Aruba, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Belize, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and Turks and Caicos.   Industry  As discussed below under \"Business \u2013 Worldwide Pandemic,\" beginning in March 2020, the travel industry was adversely impacted in 2020, 2021, and 2022 by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Omicron variant in early 2022. Southwest, like other U.S. airlines, experienced significant negative impacts to passenger demand and revenues; however, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on some of these airlines was particularly severe because of the percentage of their operations that had historically been dependent on business and international travel, each of which suffered particular harm as a result of the pandemic. Demand for business travel declined significantly due to companies tightening or even suspending corporate travel. This not only reduced overall demand for air travel, but also resulted in a decrease in the percentage of full-fare purchases. Demand for international travel was significantly harmed by the imposition of international travel restrictions.   Southwest, like other U.S. airlines, continued to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022, while facing challenges such as the Omicron variant early in the year, higher fuel prices and other cost inflation, economic uncertainty, weather events, and, until the Company returned to pre-pandemic staffing levels in May 2022, operational challenges resulting from surges in leisure travel demand against constrained personnel resources. Overall, the U.S. airline industry saw a strong recovery of domestic leisure travel demand in 2022 as a result of declining reported COVID-19 cases throughout the United States and the easing of travel restrictions. Business travel, however, remained at a reduced level throughout 2022, as compared with pre-pandemic levels.  The airline industry has historically been an extremely volatile industry subject to numerous other challenges. Among other things, it has been cyclical, energy intensive, labor intensive, capital intensive, technology intensive, highly regulated, heavily taxed, and extremely competitive. The airline industry has also been particularly susceptible to detrimental events such as economic recessions, jet fuel price volatility, unscheduled maintenance disruptions, U.S. government shutdowns, acts of terrorism, severe weather, and natural disasters.  Historically, airline industry results have been particularly susceptible to fuel price volatility. In 2022, the industry experienced a very challenging fuel environment, as compared with recent years, with year-over-year fuel prices significantly higher throughout 2022.  Worldwide Pandemic  In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, as a pandemic. The speed with which the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic changed the U.S. economic landscape, outlook, and in particular the travel industry, was swift and unexpected. The Company experienced significant disruptions in travel and reduced bookings throughout the remainder of 2020, 2021, and early 2022 as a result of the pandemic and subsequent variants of COVID-19. Following a significant negative impact to revenues and bookings in January and February 2022, which included increased trip cancellations and staffing challenges associated with the Omicron variant, the Company saw improvements in revenue trends in March 2022 and throughout the remainder of 2022 as COVID-19 cases significantly trended downward.  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents  During the pandemic, the Company substantially enhanced its cash holdings by obtaining significant financing in the capital markets, through payroll funding support (\"Payroll Support\") with the U.S. Department of Treasury (\"Treasury\"), and elsewhere. In addition, the Company offered voluntary separation and extended time-off programs for its Employees, which significantly reduced the Company's active headcount, to better match the reduced level of travel demand, especially during the early stages of the pandemic. The unpredictable fluctuating extent of the travel demand recovery, combined with the reduction in the Company's available workforce during 2020 and 2021, contributed to operational challenges during early parts of 2022 as the Company aggressively hired new Employees throughout 2022 in order to return to the staffing levels necessary for operational demands. The Company returned to pre-pandemic staffing levels in May 2022.   For further information on risks related to COVID-19, as well as the significant impacts of COVID-19 on the Company's operations, financial performance, and liquidity, see \"Risk Factors,\" \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" and Notes 2, 7, and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Company Operations  Route Structure  Southwest has historically principally provided point-to-point service, rather than the \"hub-and-spoke\" service provided by most major U.S. airlines. The hub-and-spoke system concentrates most of an airline's operations at a limited number of central hub cities and serves most other destinations in the system by providing one-stop or connecting service through a hub. By not concentrating operations exclusively through one or more central transfer points, Southwest's route structure has allowed for more direct nonstop routing than hub-and-spoke service. While the Company does not operate a traditional hub-and-spoke model, in recent years the Company has increasingly focused on designing its network around core stations in an effort to provide greater connectivity, and support operational reliability and recoverability. In addition, the Company has focused its efforts in 2022 and thus far in 2023 towards restoring its pre-pandemic network, including long-haul service. Approximately 74 percent of the Company's Customers flew nonstop during 2022, compared with 73 percent during 2021, and compared with 72 percent during 2020, and, as of December 31, 2022, Southwest served 825 nonstop city pairs, compared with 788 as of December 31, 2021, and compared with 667 as of December 31, 2020. For 2022, the Company\u2019s average aircraft trip stage length was 728 miles, with an average duration of approximately 2.0 hours, as compared with an average aircraft trip stage length of 790 miles and an average duration of approximately 2.1 hours in 2021, and as compared with an average aircraft trip stage length of 743 miles and an average duration of approximately 2.0 hours in 2020.  Southwest\u2019s route network has also enabled it to provide its markets with frequent, conveniently timed flights and low fares. For example, Southwest currently offers 12 weekday roundtrips between Dallas Love Field and Houston Hobby (and an additional five to Houston Bush), eight weekday roundtrips between Denver and Chicago Midway (and an additional six to Chicago O'Hare), ten weekday roundtrips between Los Angeles International and Las Vegas, 12 weekday round trips between Burbank and Oakland, and 13 weekday roundtrips between Phoenix and Denver. Southwest complements its high-frequency short-haul routes with long-haul nonstop service including flights between Hawaii and California, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, and between markets such as Los Angeles and Nashville, New York LaGuardia and Houston, Los Angeles and Baltimore, Oakland and Houston, and San Diego and Baltimore.  The Company continually works to optimize its route network and schedule through the adjustment of frequencies in its existing markets and the addition of new markets and itineraries, while also pruning less profitable flights from its schedule. The Company's network and schedule optimization efforts were particularly beneficial in addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, these efforts enabled the Company to add cities in key existing markets, as well as opportunistically introduce service in other markets during the pandemic. As part of the Company's recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company remains focused on maturing newer markets and restoring its network to pre-pandemic levels through adding back breadth and frequency to the  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents Company's network while balancing its network schedule with its crew resources. The Company began service to 14 new destinations in 2021. The additional service has created additional regional and international connectivity that has been structured to grow the Company's presence in strategic markets that serve as cornerstones for its network and provide additional options for Customers to reach their final destinations. The Company expects to complement and strengthen its existing route network in or near cities where its Customer base is large, along with adding easier access to popular leisure-oriented destinations.   The COVID-19 pandemic had a particularly negative impact on the Company's international operations and led to the Company's suspension of international operations at the beginning of the pandemic. The Company has since resumed service to all 14 of its international destinations.   Cost Structure  A key component of the Company's business strategy is its focus on cost discipline and charging competitively low fares. The Company's low-cost strategy includes, among other elements, (i) the use of a single aircraft type, the Boeing 737, (ii) the Company's route structure, and (iii) its historically productive Employees. Southwest's use of a single aircraft type has historically allowed for simplified scheduling, maintenance, flight operations, safety management, and training activities. Southwest's route structure includes service to and from many secondary or downtown airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, Burbank, Manchester, Oakland, San Jose, Providence, and Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood. These conveniently located airports are typically less congested than other airlines' hub airports, which has contributed to Southwest's ability to achieve high asset utilization because aircraft can be scheduled to minimize the amount of time they are on the ground. This, in turn, has reduced the number of aircraft and gate facilities that would otherwise be required and is designed to allow for high Employee productivity (lower headcount per aircraft). The Company continues to focus on restoring its route network, with nearly all planned 2023 capacity growth going toward adding depth and breadth in key Southwest markets, which is designed to improve Employee productivity and operational resilience.  The Company's focus on controlling costs also includes a continued commitment to pursuing, implementing, and enhancing initiatives to reduce fuel consumption and improve fuel efficiency (available seat miles per fuel gallon consumed). The Company focuses on minimizing fuel consumption and improving fuel efficiency through fleet modernization and other fuel initiatives. For example, in 2022, the Company added 68 Boeing 737-8 (\u201c-8\u201d) aircraft to its fleet, with the goal of lowering operating costs, improving potential growth opportunities, restoring the Company's network closer to pre-pandemic levels, reducing carbon emissions per available seat mile, and further modernizing the Company's fleet with more fuel efficient aircraft.   Fuel and oil expense can be extremely volatile and unpredictable, and even a small change in market fuel prices can significantly affect profitability. Fuel and oil expense for 2022 increased significantly compared with 2021, primarily due to higher market jet fuel prices. Fuel and oil expense remained the Company's second largest operating cost for 2022. As evidenced by the table below, energy prices can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short amount of time. The table below shows the Company's average cost of jet fuel for each year beginning in 2011 and during each quarter of 2022.    5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents   YearCost(Millions)AverageCost\u00a0PerGallonPercentage\u00a0ofOperatingExpenses2011$5,751\u00a0$3.25\u00a038.2\u00a0%2012$6,156\u00a0$3.32\u00a037.3\u00a0%2013$5,823\u00a0$3.19\u00a035.3\u00a0%2014$5,355\u00a0$2.97\u00a032.6\u00a0%2015$3,740\u00a0$1.96\u00a023.6\u00a0%2016$3,801\u00a0$1.90\u00a022.7\u00a0%2017$4,076\u00a0$1.99\u00a023.0\u00a0%2018$4,616\u00a0$2.20\u00a024.6\u00a0%2019$4,347\u00a0$2.09\u00a022.3\u00a0%2020$1,849\u00a0$1.45\u00a014.4\u00a0%2021$3,310\u00a0$1.98\u00a023.5\u00a0%2022$5,975\u00a0$3.10\u00a026.2\u00a0%First Quarter 2022$1,004\u00a0$2.30\u00a020.7\u00a0%Second Quarter 2022$1,636\u00a0$3.36\u00a029.4\u00a0%Third Quarter 2022\u00a0$1,750\u00a0$3.39\u00a030.0\u00a0%Fourth Quarter 2022\u00a0$1,585\u00a0$3.27\u00a024.2\u00a0%  The Company\u2019s fuel efficiency was aided in 2022, as compared with 2021, through the addition of 68 -8 aircraft to its fleet and by the retirement of 26 of its oldest, least fuel-efficient Boeing 737-700 (\u201c-700\u201d) aircraft. However, the Company\u2019s fuel efficiency decreased in 2022, as compared with 2021, primarily as a result of the Company\u2019s significantly increased Load factor and operating more of its least fuel- efficient -700 aircraft versus 2021 when many of the Company\u2019s -700 aircraft were in storage. While the Company was contractually scheduled to receive 114 Boeing 737 MAX (\u201cMAX\u201d) deliveries in 2022, including exercised options, 46 of these aircraft were undelivered due to The Boeing Company's (\"Boeing\") supply chain challenges and delays in the Boeing 737-7 (\u201c-7\u201d) certification. The Company expects the remaining 46 contractual undelivered aircraft to shift into future years. The Company continues to plan for 27 Boeing -700 retirements in 2023, and 30-35 Boeing -700 retirements annually for the next several years thereafter. The Company exercised a total of 91 MAX options during 2022 and held 147 remaining MAX options at December 31, 2022, in addition to 417 firm orders of MAX aircraft to be delivered through 2030. The Company retains significant flexibility to manage its fleet size, including opportunities to accelerate fleet modernization efforts (e.g., through accelerated retirements of the Company's -700 aircraft) if growth opportunities do not materialize. Given current supply chain and aircraft delivery delays, the Company will continue working with Boeing to solidify future delivery dates. For further information regarding the Company\u2019s contractual order book see \u201cProperties\u201d and \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" The delivery schedule for the -7 is dependent on the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) issuing required certifications and approvals to Boeing and the Company. The FAA will ultimately determine the timing of the -7 certification and entry into service, and the Company therefore offers no assurances that current estimations and timelines are correct.  The Company continues to undertake a number of other fuel conservation initiatives, which are discussed in detail under \"Environmental Sustainability.\"  The table below sets forth the Company's available seat miles produced per fuel gallon consumed over the last five years:   6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u00a0Year ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\u00a02022\u00a02021202020192018Available seat miles per fuel gallon consumed\u00a077.3\u00a079.2\u00a081.375.776.3  The Company also enters into fuel derivative contracts to manage its risk associated with significant increases in fuel prices. The Company's fuel hedging activities, as well as the risks associated with high and/or volatile fuel prices, are discussed in more detail below under \"Risk Factors,\" \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Salaries, wages, and benefits expense constituted approximately 41.0 percent of the Company's operating expenses  during 2022 and was the Company's largest operating cost. The Company's ability to control labor costs is limited by the terms of its collective-bargaining agreements, and increased labor costs have negatively impacted the Company's low-cost competitive position. The Company's labor costs, and risks associated therewith, are discussed in more detail below under \"Risk Factors,\" \"Business - Employees,\" and \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"  Fare Structure  General  Southwest offers a relatively simple fare structure that features competitive fares and product benefits, including unrestricted fares, as well as lower fares available on a restricted basis. In 2022, Southwest introduced a new fare product, \"Wanna Get Away PlusTM,\" that adds more flexibility, options, and rewards to Southwest\u2019s fare lineup.  Southwest fare products include four major categories: \"Wanna Get Away\u00ae,\" \"Wanna Get Away Plus,\" \"Anytime,\" and \"Business Select\u00ae,\" to provide Customers options when choosing a fare. All fare products include the privilege of two free checked bags (weight and size limits apply). Southwest does not charge fees for cancellations or changes to flight reservations although fare differences may apply.  \u2022\"Wanna Get Away\" fares are generally the lowest fares and are typically subject to advance purchase requirements. They are non-refundable, but, subject to Southwest's No-Show Policy, flight credit for the fare paid for unused travel by the Customer (\"flight credit\") may be applied towards future travel on Southwest. Wanna Get Away fares earn six Rapid Rewards\u00ae points, under Southwest's Rapid Rewards loyalty program, for each dollar spent on the base fare. The Company's loyalty program is discussed below under \"Rapid Rewards Loyalty Program.\" \u2022\u201cWanna Get Away Plus\u201d fares are non-refundable, but, subject to Southwest\u2019s No-Show Policy, flight credit may be applied towards future travel on Southwest. \u201cWanna Get Away Plus\u201d fares earn eight Rapid Rewards points for each dollar spent on the base fare. \u201cWanna Get Away Plus\u201d fares offer Transferable Flight CreditTM that enables Customers to transfer an eligible unused flight credit to another traveler for future use. Both must be Rapid Rewards members and only one transfer is permitted. For bookings through a Southwest Business (corporate travel) channel, a transfer may only be made to an employee of the same organization. Subject to Southwest\u2019s No-Show Policy, \u201cWanna Get Away Plus\u201d fares also enable a same-day confirmed change, free of airline charges, if there is an open seat on another flight that departs on the same day as the original flight and is between the same cities, but the Customer is required to pay any additional government taxes and fees associated with changes in their itinerary. If there is no open seat on this different flight, a traveler may request to be added to the standby list for that flight. \u2022\"Anytime\" fares are, subject to Southwest's No-Show Policy, refundable if canceled, or flight credit may be applied towards future travel on Southwest. If this fare is purchased with non-refundable flight credit, then the resulting flight credit will be non-refundable if travel is canceled. Anytime fares earn 10 Rapid Rewards points for each dollar spent on the base fare. \u201cAnytime\u201d fares also receive EarlyBird Check-In\u00ae. See  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u201cAncillary Services\u201d below for further information about EarlyBird Check-In. Additionally, \u201cAnytime\u201d fares receive Priority Lane and Express Lane access through check-in and security lines where available. Further, \u201cAnytime\u201d fares receive all of the benefits of \u201cWanna Get Away Plus\u201d fares, including Transferrable Flight Credit and same-day confirmed changes and standby listings. \u2022\"Business Select\" fares are, subject to Southwest's No-Show Policy, refundable if canceled, or flight credit may be applied towards future travel on Southwest. If this fare is purchased with non-refundable flight credit, then the resulting flight credit will be non-refundable if travel is canceled. Business Select fares also include additional perks such as priority boarding with a boarding position in the first 15 boarding positions within boarding group \"A,\" 12 Rapid Rewards points per dollar spent on the base fare - the highest loyalty point multiplier of all Southwest fare products, and one complimentary premium beverage coupon for the day of travel (Customers must be of legal drinking age to drink alcoholic beverages). \u201cBusiness Select\u201d fares also receive all of the benefits of \u201cAnytime\u201d fares, including Priority Lane and Express Lane access through check-in and security lines where available, Transferable Flight Credit, and same-day confirmed changes and standby listings.  Southwest's No-Show Policy applies if a Customer does not change or cancel a flight segment at least ten minutes prior to scheduled departure and the Customer does not travel on the scheduled flight. In such event, subject to certain exceptions, all segments associated with the reservation will be canceled, and (i) with respect to a \"Wanna Get Away\" and \u201cWanna Get Away Plus\u201d fares, the fare paid for unused travel will be forfeited; and (ii) with respect to an \"Anytime\" or \"Business Select\" fare, the fare paid for unused travel will be held as a flight credit for future travel on Southwest.  In order to enhance and expand upon its already generous and flexible ticketing policies, the Company announced in 2022 that flight credits will no longer expire. The Company expects that this policy change, combined with its other attractive brand attributes, will contribute to an increase in Customer loyalty. Flight credits result from canceling reservations and previously were valid for no longer than one year from the date of original purchase, with the exception of certain flight credits that were set to expire or were created during the early stages of the pandemic, which were originally given extended expiration dates. Flight credits for non-refundable fares are issued as long as the reservation is cancelled more than 10 minutes prior to the scheduled departure. Flight credits or refunds for refundable fares are issued regardless of cancellation time. Flight credits unexpired on, or created on or after July 28, 2022, do not expire and will show an expiration date (12/31/2040) until the Company\u2019s systems are updated. A flight credit with an expiration date on or before July 27, 2022, has expired in accordance with its existing expiration date.   Ancillary Services  The Company offers ancillary services such as Southwest's EarlyBird Check-In\u00ae, Upgraded Boarding, and transportation of pets and unaccompanied minors, in accordance with Southwest's respective policies.  EarlyBird Check-In provides Customers with automatic check-in and an assigned boarding position before general boarding positions become available, thereby improving Customers' seat selection options (priority boarding privileges are already a benefit of being an \"A-List\" tier member under the Company's Rapid Rewards Loyalty Program). The Company has implemented a variable pricing model for EarlyBird Check-In based on the length of the flight and the historical popularity of EarlyBird Check-In on the route.  When available, Southwest sells Upgraded Boarding at the airport or on Customer mobile devices, which allows a Customer to pay for an open priority boarding position in the first 15 positions in its \"A\" boarding group.  Southwest\u2019s Pet Policy provides Customers an opportunity to travel with a small cat or dog in the aircraft cabin on domestic flights. Southwest also has an unaccompanied minor travel policy, with pricing to address the administrative costs and the extra care necessary to safely transport these Customers.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Rapid Rewards Loyalty Program  Southwest's Rapid Rewards loyalty program enables program members (\"Members\") to earn points for every dollar spent on Southwest base fares, also including purchases paid with LUV Vouchers, gift cards, or flight credit, with no portion of the purchase price paid with Rapid Rewards points. The amount of points earned under the program is based on the base fare and fare class purchased, with higher fare products (e.g., Business Select) earning more points than lower fare products (e.g., Wanna Get Away). As discussed above under \"Fare Structure - General,\" each fare class is associated with a points earning multiplier, and points for flights are calculated by multiplying the base fare for the flight by the fare class multiplier. The amount of points required to be redeemed for a flight is based on the base fare and a multiplier. Under the program, (i) Members are able to redeem their points for every available seat, every day, on every flight, with no blackout dates; and (ii) points do not expire.  Under the program, Members continue to accumulate points until the time they decide to redeem them. As a result, the program provides Members significant flexibility and options for earning and redeeming rewards. For example, Members can earn more points (and/or achieve tier status such as A-List or Companion Pass faster) by purchasing higher fare tickets. Members also have significant flexibility in redeeming points, such as the opportunity to book in advance to take advantage of a lower fare ticket (including many fare sales) requiring fewer points, or by being able to redeem at the last minute, if seats are still available for sale. Members can also earn points through qualifying purchases with Rapid Rewards Partners (which include, for example, car rental agencies, hotels, and restaurants), as well as by using Southwest's co-branded Chase\u00ae Visa credit card. In addition to earning points for revenue flights and qualifying purchases with Rapid Rewards Partners, Members also have the ability to purchase, gift, and transfer points, as well as the ability to donate points to selected charities.  Southwest's Rapid Rewards loyalty program features tier status and Companion Pass programs for the most active Members, including \"A-List\" and \"A-List Preferred\" status. A Member who flies 25 qualifying one-way flight segments booked through Southwest or earns 35,000 tier qualifying points per calendar year will qualify for A-List status. A Member who flies 50 qualifying one-way flights booked through Southwest or earns 70,000 tier qualifying points per calendar year will qualify for A-List Preferred status. The Member will maintain A-List or A-List Preferred status for the remainder of the calendar year in which the status is earned and for the entire calendar year immediately following. Both A-List and A-List Preferred Members enjoy benefits such as priority check-in and security lane access, where available, as well as dedicated phone lines, standby priority, and an earnings bonus on eligible revenue flights (25 percent for A-List and 100 percent for A-List Preferred). In addition, A-List Preferred Members enjoy free inflight satellite internet service on WiFi-enabled aircraft, where available. Members who attain A-List or A-List Preferred status receive priority boarding privileges. When these Customers purchase travel at least 36 hours prior to flight time, they receive the best boarding position available (generally, an \"A\" boarding pass). If an A-List or A-List Preferred Member's plans change, subject to Southwest\u2019s No Show Policy, they are entitled to same-day confirmed change, free of airline charges, if there is an open seat on another flight that departs on the same day as the original flight and is between the same cities, but the Customer is required to pay any additional government taxes and fees associated with changes in their itinerary. If there is no open seat on this different flight, a traveler may request to be added to the standby list for that flight. Another feature of the Rapid Rewards loyalty program is the Companion Pass. Members who fly 100 qualifying one-way flights or earn 135,000 qualifying points in a calendar year automatically receive a Companion Pass, which provides for unlimited travel for the designated Companion free of charges (other than taxes and fees). The Companion Pass is valid for the remainder of the calendar year in which status is earned and for the following full calendar year to any destination available on Southwest for a designated Companion of the qualifying Member. The Member and designated Companion must travel together on the same flight.  During 2021, the Company added Rapid Rewards Business, giving businesses the ability to earn Rapid Rewards points. By joining Rapid Rewards Business, companies earn Rapid Rewards points that can be applied toward travel on the company's behalf, while travelers who are Rapid Rewards Members also earn Rapid Rewards points in their personal accounts. Rapid Rewards business accounts generally have the same opportunities and benefits to earn and redeem points as individual Member accounts.  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Southwest's Rapid Rewards loyalty program has been designed to drive more revenue by (i) bringing in new Customers, including new Members, as well as new holders of Southwest's co-branded Chase Visa credit card; (ii) increasing business from existing Customers; and (iii) strengthening the Company's Rapid Rewards hotel, rental car, credit card, and other partnerships.  For 2022, Customers of Southwest redeemed approximately 9.2 million flight awards, accounting for approximately 15.0 percent of revenue passenger miles flown. For 2021, Customers of Southwest redeemed approximately 8.1 million flight awards, accounting for approximately 17.3 percent of revenue passenger miles flown. For 2020, Customers of Southwest redeemed approximately 4.1 million flight awards, accounting for approximately 15.8 percent of revenue passenger miles flown. The Company's accounting policies with respect to its loyalty programs are discussed in more detail in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Investments in Customer Experience  During 2022, the Company announced its multi-year plan to modernize and transform the Customer Experience. These enhancements, expected to cost over $2 billion over a five-year period, include the Company\u2019s plans to:  \u2022bring enhanced WiFi connectivity onboard aircraft; \u2022install latest-technology onboard power ports on MAX aircraft beginning in 2023 to charge personal devices at every seat; \u2022offer larger overhead bins on new aircraft deliveries beginning in 2023 with more space and easier access to carryon items; \u2022introduce more entertainment options and a wider selection of refreshments in the cabin; and \u2022enable new self-service capabilities to bring elevated ease in doing business with the Company, benefitting Employees and Customers.  Inflight Entertainment Portal and WiFi Service   Southwest offers inflight entertainment and connectivity service on WiFi-enabled aircraft on the majority of its fleet, where available. Southwest's suite of complimentary offerings onboard WiFi-enabled aircraft includes movies-on-demand, messaging, music, live and on-demand television, a flight tracker, and connecting flight information. The inflight entertainment service allows Customers to enjoy gate-to-gate entertainment directly on their personal wireless devices. Customers can also purchase satellite internet service while on WiFi-enabled aircraft, where available.  As noted above under \u201cInvestments in Customer Experience,\u201d the Company has announced plans to bring enhanced WiFi connectivity onboard its aircraft in order to improve speed, reliability, and bandwidth. In addition to latest-generation upgraded Wifi hardware on its new deliveries, the Company is in the process of upgrading WiFi on its existing fleet. The Company also plans to install latest-generation onboard USB A and USB C power ports on every seat onboard MAX aircraft beginning in 2023, with a space-saving system that maintains legroom.  As noted above under \u201cInvestments in Customer Experience,\u201d the Company has enhanced the entertainment options onboard its aircraft. The free inflight entertainment offerings include over 125 free movies-on-demand each month and free app messaging via iMessage or WhatsApp. The television product consists of 16 live channels and approximately 70 on-demand recorded episodes from popular television series. In addition, the onboard entertainment portal offers free digital music and live streaming radio service to Customers within the onboard entertainment portal.  Southwest.com and Direct to Customer Distribution Approach  The Company primarily offers its fare products directly to Customers through its Internet website, Southwest.com, and the Southwest App. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, approximately 83 percent and 86 percent, respectively, of the Company\u2019s Passenger revenues originated from Southwest.com or the  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Southwest App (including revenues from SWABIZ\u00ae, the Company's online booking tool designed for business Customers who prefer a self-service and low-cost solution for booking their air travel on Southwest). This \"direct to Customer\" distribution approach has historically provided a cost advantage for the Company because it eliminates fees associated with the use of third party distribution channels such as third party online travel platforms. The Company augments its direct to Customer distribution approach by offering a broad suite of digital platforms to support Customers' travel needs, including full featured websites and apps. These digital platforms help Customers book and manage their Southwest air travel and also facilitate the purchase of the Company\u2019s ancillary products, including Fare Upgrades, EarlyBird, Upgraded Boarding, vacation packages, rental car reservations, hotel reservations, and travel activities. In addition, the digital platforms provide self-service tools for reservation management and Customer support.   As noted above under \u201cInvestments in Customer Experience,\u201d\u202fthe Company continued to make significant digital investments in 2022 to improve the travel experience. All digital storefronts were updated to enable Customers to buy the Wanna Get Away Plus fare product along with updates to other fare products activated in May 2022. The Company also completed the activation of a buy now, pay later platform across all digital storefronts enabling Customers with additional payment options within the Android, iOS, mobile web and desktop platforms. Venmo was also added as a payment option for purchase of Inflight Internet while onboard. Further, new functionality for the Company\u2019s digital platforms and airport kiosks now help give Customers the ability to move more efficiently from curb to gate. Customers are now able to purchase Upgraded Boarding on their mobile devices without standing in line at the airport. The Company has also given Customers the ability to add lap child travelers when booking online and has added lap child check-in at self-service kiosks to empower Customers with more self-service options.  The Company\u2019s digital help center and related features also underwent optimization to better prepare Customers for using the Company\u2019s products and services. Improvements were made to digital trip cards, which now provide targeted trip information such as weather advisories and airport alerts. The Airport Information page was updated with mobile friendly features and is now more easily searchable to improve Customers\u2019 day of travel wayfinding. Digital experiences were also updated to provide additional context on the Flight Credits Don\u2019t Expire policy change. Introducing more self-service options builds on the Company\u2019s effort to reduce wait times with improved and simplified online change functionality. Recent improvements were designed to reduce the need for Customers to call to make flight changes, and therefore reduce hold times to allow Southwest Representatives more availability for specialized Hospitality and Customer Service.  Southwest Business\u00ae Initiatives  In addition to improvements in the Company's consumer-direct Southwest.com channel of distribution, in recent years the Company has taken significant action, including investments in Employees, processes, and technology, in order to grow its corporate travel business with the goal of making it easier for corporate travel Customers and travel management companies to do business with Southwest.  In 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Amadeus IT Group, S.A. (\"Amadeus\"), and expanded its agreement with Travelport, LP and Travelport International Operations Limited (collectively, \"Travelport\"), to enable corporate travel Customers and travel management companies to book Southwest products on the Amadeus and Travelport global distribution system (\"GDS\") platforms. The Company began accepting corporate travel bookings through (i) Travelport's Apollo and Worldspan GDS platforms in second quarter 2020, (ii) Travelport's Galileo GDS platform in third quarter 2020, and (iii) the Amadeus GDS platform in fourth quarter 2020. The Company's expansion into the Travelport and Amadeus GDS channels is intended to facilitate corporate travel managers' ability to book, modify, and cancel Southwest reservations.   In 2020, the Company entered into a new full participation distribution agreement with Sabre Corporation (\"Sabre\"), to enable Sabre to continue to distribute Southwest content through traditional connectivity to corporations, government agencies, and travel management companies through Sabre's GDS. In July 2021, the Company began offering flights for sale within Sabre's GDS, the leading corporate booking channel in the United  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents States. As a result, the Company now offers the ability for business travelers and travel decision makers to book Southwest fares within all major GDS platforms.   The Company utilizes Airlines Reporting Corporation to implement industry-standard processes to handle the settlement of tickets booked through Travelport, Amadeus, and Sabre channels. The Company also utilizes ATPCO Routehappy to provide detailed product information that supports robust shopping and selling processes in third party booking channels.  In 2022, the Company launched its new travel portal, Southwest Business Assist\u2122. The self-service tool enables corporate travel buyers, travel decision makers, and travel management companies to better manage their business travel on Southwest using dashboards, reports, automated processing of travel benefits, and Customer Service. The on-demand self-service tool provides access to real-time information and reporting. Southwest Business has also continued to invest in and enhance its online booking tool SWABIZ\u00ae, with mobile capabilities. SWABIZ is designed for business Customers who prefer a self-service and low-cost solution for booking their air travel on Southwest. The site also facilitates car and hotel booking.  Marketing  During 2022, the Company continued to market its competitive points of differentiation and Customer-friendly policies, specifically focusing on flexibility and ease for Customers. Southwest continues to be the only major U.S. airline that offers to all ticketed Customers up to two checked bags that fly free (subject to weight and size limits). Further, Southwest continues to offer low fares and no change fees (although fare differences may apply), cancellation fees (subject to the Company\u2019s No Show policy), or hidden fees. The Company also continued to market that its Rapid Rewards points do not expire, and began marketing its new policy that flight credits do not expire. Southwest also does not impose additional fees for items such as seat selection, soft drinks and snacks where available, curb-side check-in where available, and telephone reservations.   During 2022, the Company also marketed its multi-year plan to modernize and transform the Customer Experience through, among other things, enhanced WiFi connectivity onboard its aircraft in order to improve speed, reliability, and bandwidth, new in-seat power, larger overhead bins, and Upgraded Boarding self-service. See \"Investments in Customer Experience\" for further information.   The Company also continues to promote all of the many other reasons to fly Southwest in its marketing, such as its hospitality, low fares, expanded network, Customer Service, free inflight entertainment, Southwest Business offerings, and its Rapid Rewards loyalty program.  Technology Initiatives  The Company is focused on the prioritization and execution of its technology investments through an evolving multi-year plan for technology, with the goal of developing stronger, more adaptable, more efficient, and more reliable technology systems to support the Company's strategic priorities. The Company has committed, and plans to continue to commit, significant resources to technology improvements in support of its ongoing operations and initiatives. During 2022, among other things, the Company added technology for (i) a new fare product launch; (ii) a new human resources and payroll system; (iii) a new business travel management system; and (iv) enhanced cyber controls and monitoring. During 2021, the Company achieved the significant milestone of getting all of its aircraft into a single system for aircraft maintenance and record-keeping. This was one of the most critical maintenance system updates the Company has undertaken in its history.   The Company invests significantly in technology resources including, among others, the Company's systems related to (i) flight planning and scheduling; (ii) daily flight schedule management; (iii) aircraft turn capabilities; (iv) crew mobility and scheduling; (v) foundational operating systems; (vi) ancillary products, including vacation packages; (vii) revenue management; (viii) Customer Service Agent mobility; (ix) technology infrastructure and cybersecurity; and (x) improved Customer self-service offerings.  12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents Environmental Sustainability  The Company remains steadfast in its desire to pursue, implement, and enhance initiatives to address the Company's impact on the environment. Over the years, the Company has undertaken a number of initiatives that have a direct impact on its fuel conservation and emissions-related reduction efforts, such as the following:  \u2022introduction of the MAX aircraft into the Company's fleet, which is more fuel-efficient and releases fewer CO\u2082 emissions per available seat mile than the Company's previous generation of 737 aircraft; \u2022installation of winglets, which reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency, on all aircraft in the Company's fleet; \u2022application of periodic engine washes; \u2022implementation of procedures for the use of electric ground power and pre-conditioned air for aircraft at the gate, when available; \u2022replacement of eligible internal combustion ground support equipment with electric equipment at select locations; \u2022deployment of auto-throttle and vertical navigation to maintain optimum cruising speeds; \u2022implementation of engine start procedures to support the Company's single engine taxi procedures; \u2022implementation of procedures on the timing of auxiliary power unit starts on originating flights to reduce auxiliary power unit usage; \u2022implementation of fuel planning initiatives to safely reduce loading of excess fuel; \u2022retrofitting of aircraft cabin interiors to reduce weight; \u2022implementation of procedures to reduce aircraft engine idle speed while on the ground, which also increases engine life; \u2022utilization of Company-optimized routes (including flying the best wind routes to take advantage of tailwinds or to minimize headwinds); \u2022improvements in flight planning algorithms to better match the Company's aircraft flight management system and thereby enabling the Company to fly at the most efficient altitudes; \u2022substitution of Pilot and Flight Attendant flight bags and paper manuals with lighter Electronic Flight Bag tablets; and \u2022implementation of Real Time Descent Winds (automatic uplinking of up-to-date wind data to the aircraft, allowing crews to time the descent to minimize thrust inputs).  The Company participates in Required Navigation Performance (\"RNP\") operations as part of the FAA's Performance Based Navigation program, a key component of the Next Generation Transportation System (\u201cNextGen\u201d), which is intended to modernize the U.S. air traffic system by addressing limitations on air transportation capacity and making more efficient use of airspace. RNP combines the capabilities of advanced aircraft avionics, satellite navigation (instead of less precise ground-based navigation), and new flight procedures to enhance navigational and operational capabilities, improve fuel efficiency, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. RNP approaches, which are published by the FAA, are currently available at 66 of the airports Southwest serves. Southwest continues to work with the FAA to develop and seek more use of RNP approaches and to evolve air traffic control rules to support greater utilization of RNP.  In 2021, the Company announced near- and long-term environmental sustainability goals, in addition to a series of actions and initiatives designed to assist the Company in achieving these goals. The Company continually monitors developments related to climate change and evaluates its goals and progress against these developments. The Company expects its path toward achievement of these goals will depend on, among other things (i) increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (\u201cSAF\u201d), which is not presently available at scale or at prices competitive to jet fuel; (ii) improved fuel efficiency from fleet renewal or planned fuel efficiency initiatives; (iii) operational initiatives; and (iv) technological innovation.  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents During 2022, the Company joined the Vision 2045 campaign, a collaboration among multiple organizations and companies to share films and resources that aim to inspire businesses and people to take action toward a more sustainable future. In addition, during 2022, the Company invested in SAFFiRE Renewables, LLC (\u201cSAFFiRE\u201d), a company formed by D3MAX, LLC, as part of a Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d)-backed project to develop and produce scalable SAF. Funded with a DOE grant matched by the Company's investment, SAFFiRE intends to utilize technology developed by the DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory to convert corn stover, a widely available waste feedstock in the United States, into renewable ethanol that then would be upgraded into SAF.  As part of its commitment to corporate sustainability, the Company has published the Southwest One Report describing the Company's environmental sustainability goals, actions, initiatives, and strategies, which include the foregoing and other efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental matters such as energy and water conservation, waste minimization, and recycling. Information contained in the Southwest One Report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Form 10-K. While the Company believes that the disclosures contained in the Southwest One Report and other voluntary disclosures regarding environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters are responsive to various areas of investor interest, the Company believes that certain of these disclosures do not currently address matters that are material to the Company\u2019s operations, strategy, financial condition, or financial results, although this view may change in the future based on new information that could materially alter the estimates, assumptions, or timelines used to create these disclosures. Given the estimates, assumptions and timelines used to create the Southwest One Report and other voluntary disclosures, the materiality of these disclosures is inherently difficult to assess in advance.   Regulation  The airline industry is heavily regulated, especially by the federal government, and there are a significant number of governmental agencies and legislative bodies that have the ability to directly or indirectly affect the Company and/or the airline industry financially and/or operationally. Examples of regulations affecting the Company and/or the airline industry, that have been or may be imposed by several of these governmental agencies and legislative bodies, are discussed below.  Economic and Consumer Protection Regulation  Regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation  The U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") regulates economic operating authority for air carriers and consumer protection for airline passengers. The DOT may take legal enforcement action against air carriers for violating their regulations by imposing civil penalties up to $37,377 per occurrence.  To provide passenger transportation in the United States, a domestic airline is required to hold a Certificate of Public Convenience & Necessity from the DOT. A Certificate of Public Convenience & Necessity is unlimited in duration, and the Company\u2019s certificate generally permits it to operate among any points within the United States and its territories and possessions. Additional DOT authority, in the form of a certificate or exemption from certificate requirements, is required for a U.S. airline to serve foreign destinations either with its own aircraft or via code-sharing with another airline. Exemptions granted by the DOT to serve international markets are generally limited in duration and are subject to periodic renewal requirements. The DOT may revoke a certificate or exemption, in whole or in part, for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders, or the terms of the certificate or exemption itself.  The DOT's consumer protection and enforcement authority is derived primarily from a federal statutory prohibition on \"unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition\" by air carriers. A new DOT rule took effect in January 2021, codifying the definitions for the terms \u2018\u2018unfair\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018deceptive\u2019\u2019 in the DOT\u2019s regulations by adopting the definitions used by the Federal Trade Commission, and amending and clarifying the procedures the DOT will follow when engaging in aviation consumer protection rulemaking and enforcement. The purpose of this new rule is to help establish clear and consistent criteria for unfair or deceptive practices while aligning DOT\u2019s  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents oversight of aviation entities with other government agencies\u2019 oversight of other sectors of the economy with regard to unfair or deceptive practices.  Under the above-described authority, the DOT has adopted so-called \"Passenger Protection Rules,\" which address a wide variety of matters, including flight delays on the tarmac, chronically delayed flights, denied boarding compensation, baggage liability requirements, ticket refunds, and advertising of airfares, among others. For example, under the DOT's tarmac delay rule and subject to limited exceptions, air carriers must not allow an aircraft to remain on the tarmac for more than 3 hours (for domestic delays) or more than 4 hours (for international delays), without allowing passengers to deplane.  In addition, the Passenger Protection Rules require airlines to (i) display ontime performance on their websites; (ii) adopt customer service plans, publish those plans on their website, and audit their own compliance with their plans; (iii) designate an employee to monitor the performance of airlines' flights; (iv) provide information to passengers on how to file complaints; (v) respond in a timely and substantive fashion to consumer complaints; (vi) pay compensation to each passenger denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight; (vii) refund any checked bag fee for permanently lost luggage; (viii) prominently disclose all potential fees for optional ancillary services on their websites; and (ix) refund passenger fees paid for ancillary services if a flight cancels or oversells and a passenger is unable to take advantage of such services.   The Passenger Protection Rules also require that (i) advertised fares include all government-mandated taxes and fees; (ii) passengers be allowed to either hold a reservation for up to 24 hours without making a payment or cancel a paid reservation without penalty for 24 hours after the reservation is made, as long as the reservation is made at least seven days in advance of travel; (iii) fares may not increase after purchase; (iv) baggage fees must be disclosed to the passenger at the time of booking; (v) the same baggage allowances and fees must apply throughout a passenger\u2019s trip; (vi) baggage fees must be disclosed on e-ticket confirmations; and (vii) passengers must be promptly notified in the event of delays of more than 30 minutes or if there is a cancellation or diversion of their flight.  The DOT took actions throughout 2022 to bolster its Passenger Protection Rules in certain respects. For example,  in response to many refund-related complaints during the COVID-19 pandemic, the DOT issued a proposed rule intended to provide passengers with rights to a refund of a non-refundable ticket, in certain situations, such as when there is a public health emergency, or when a passenger has a serious communicable disease. In addition, the DOT issued a proposed rule that would require more robust fee disclosure for critical ancillary services on all distribution channels where airline tickets are sold. The Company does not expect either proposed rule, if finalized, to have a significant impact on the Company given its existing policies and practices with respect to travel credits and critical ancillary services.  The DOT also issued a Notice in July 2022 that it would begin auditing airline family seating processes, in an effort to ensure 13-and-under children are able to sit adjacent to an accompanying adult without paying a seat fee. The Company formed a multi-disciplinary internal team to address the DOT Notice, and presented the Company\u2019s plan to DOT.  Following the operational challenges across the industry during the summer of 2022, the DOT increased its review of airline operational performance. In January 2023, the DOT began investigating the Company due to the significant travel disruption at the end of December 2022 to assess the Company's compliance with DOT regulatory requirements.  The DOT also has statutory authority to prohibit discrimination by airlines against consumers on the basis of (i) disability; and (ii) race, religion, national origin, sex, or ancestry.  In March 2022, the DOT published a proposed rule on accessible lavatories. If finalized, the rule would require airlines to have one accessible (larger) lavatory on narrow-body aircraft (a) ordered 18 years after the effective date of the final rule; or (b) delivered 20 years after the effective date of the final rule; or (c) that are part of a new type- 15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents certified design filed with the FAA or a foreign carrier\u2019s safety authority one (1) year after the effective date of the final rule. The proposed rule would not require a retrofit of existing aircraft. The Company anticipates that this proposed rule, if finalized, could impose substantial costs on the Company and have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. The DOT has indicated it expects to finalize its proposed rule on larger lavatories in 2023.  Aviation Taxes and Fees  The statutory authority for the federal government to collect most types of aviation taxes, which are used, in part, to finance programs administered by the FAA, must be periodically reauthorized by the U.S. Congress. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (the \"2018 Reauthorization Act\") extends most commercial aviation taxes through September 30, 2023.   In addition to FAA-related taxes, there are additional federal taxes related to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. These taxes do not need to be reauthorized periodically. Congress has set the Transportation Security Fee paid by passengers at $5.60 per one-way passenger trip originating in the U.S. In addition, international passengers arriving in the U.S. are subject to U.S. immigration and customs fees that are indexed to inflation. These fees are used to support the operations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\"). Finally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service imposes an agriculture inspection fee on international passengers arriving in the United States.  Airline passengers are also required to pay a Passenger Facility Charge (\u201cPFC\u201d), a user fee that is authorized via federal statute but assessed by each airport. The maximum PFC is $4.50 per passenger enplanement. New or higher aviation taxes or user fees (including but not limited to the PFC), as well as new legislative mandates, may be imposed by Congress. One major piece of legislation that Congress is expected to address in 2023 is FAA reauthorization. Congress is expected to pass an FAA reauthorization bill by late 2023. This legislation could be the vehicle for increases in one or more of the taxes and fees discussed above, as well as new mandates on the DOT, FAA, and/or TSA to begin or complete rulemakings that could impact airline operations and/or finances.   Operational and Safety Regulation  The FAA, an agency within the DOT, has the authority to regulate safety aspects of civil aviation operations. Specifically, the Company and certain of its third-party service providers are subject to the jurisdiction of the FAA with respect to aircraft maintenance and operations, including equipment, ground facilities, dispatch, communications, training, and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA, from time to time, issues orders or directives relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures or operational restrictions. The FAA, acting through its own powers or through the appropriate U.S. Attorney, has the power to bring proceedings for the imposition and collection of civil penalties for violation of the FAA's regulations.  The FAA requires airlines to obtain and maintain an Air Carrier Operating Certificate, as well as other certificates, approvals, and authorities. These certificates, approvals, and authorities are subject to amendment, suspension, or revocation for cause.  As the airlines\u2019 safety regulator, the FAA uses tools, such as temporary flight restrictions, to control aircraft operations within designated areas. The FAA may also issue advisory circulars to provide guidance for compliance with aircraft and pilot certification standards, operational standards, training standards, and other FAA rules. These regulatory tools may create additional costs and/or operational restrictions for the Company. For example, the FAA has expressed concern about the deployment of certain wireless telecommunications systems that may cause interference with certain aircraft avionics, such as radio altimeters. In response, the FAA could impose temporary flight restrictions until the agency believes any safety concerns are resolved. The FAA could also require mitigations from aircraft operators (e.g., aircraft retrofits) as a means to avoid any potential interference.  16 16 16 Table of Contents Table of Contents With respect to airline operations, the FAA has rules in effect with respect to crew flight, duty, and rest times. Among other things, the rules (i) require a ten hour minimum rest period prior to a pilot\u2019s flight duty period; (ii) mandate that a pilot must have an opportunity for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep within the rest period; and (iii) impose pilot \"flight time\" and \"duty time\" limitations based upon report times, the number of scheduled flight segments, and other operational factors. The FAA has established flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements based on the length of a flight attendant\u2019s scheduled duty period, number of flight attendants assigned to a flight, and other operational factors.   On October 12, 2022, the FAA finalized new rules requiring that flight attendants scheduled to a duty period of 14 hours or less be given a scheduled rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours and that the rest period is not reduced under any circumstances. Previous rules required a scheduled rest period of at least nine consecutive hours, and allowed for a reduction to eight consecutive hours under certain circumstances. In anticipation of the final rules, the Company voluntarily implemented the new minimum rest requirements on July 1, 2022.  In July 2022, the FAA issued a proposed rule that would require that airlines have an installed physical secondary barrier to provide additional protection against unauthorized access to an aircraft\u2019s flight deck. The FAA\u2019s proposed rule contemplates a two-year compliance period from the effective date of a final rule after which any transport category airplane manufactured and used in regularly scheduled passenger-carrying operations would be required to have installed physical secondary barrier meeting the requirements of the rule. Compliance with the proposed rule could impose substantial costs on the Company. The FAA has indicated it plans to issue a final rule in 2023.  The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 contains provisions directing the FAA to examine whether to issue new regulations establishing minimum dimensions for seat size based on safety considerations. In August 2022, the FAA began soliciting stakeholder comments on the topic. If the FAA issues a rule with minimum dimensions that exceed the Company\u2019s current seat dimensions, the Company could incur substantial compliance costs.  Further, the 2018 Reauthorization Act expands human trafficking training requirements beyond flight attendants to include several public-facing Employee work groups, as well as requires air carriers to implement a plan and develop training with protocols for preventing and responding to verbal or physical assault committed against customer service agents. Human trafficking training is required for the Company\u2019s frontline Employees and recommended as voluntary curriculum for other Employees. The Company has also implemented an Employee Assault Prevention and Response Plan that includes training to de-escalate hostile situations, written protocols for dealing with hostile situations, and reporting of relevant incidents to appropriate authorities.  In addition to its role as safety regulator, the FAA operates the nation\u2019s air traffic control system and has continued its lengthy and ongoing effort to implement a multi-faceted, airspace modernization program, NextGen. According to the U.S. government, NextGen will help contribute to a safer, more efficient, and more predictable system, which may potentially contribute to reduced fuel burn, emissions, and noise. As part of the NextGen initiative, in 2010 the FAA published rules requiring most commercial aircraft operating in the national airspace system to be equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (\"ADS-B\") technology by January 1, 2020. ADS-B technology is intended to enhance safety and efficiency by moving from ground-based radar and navigational aids to precise tracking using satellite signals. In addition to environmental and efficiency benefits, ADS-B technology gives pilots and air traffic controllers new tools to reduce the risk of runway incursions and aircraft collisions. The Company has implemented technology and programs intended to comply with all applicable ADS-B requirements. On November 9, 2021, the U.S. government announced an Aviation Climate Action Plan to reduce emissions by, among other initiatives and efforts, operationalizing NextGen to realize the full potential of modernized infrastructure and systems, and enhancing data quality and information distribution to enable operators to fly more fuel-efficient trajectories.  The Air Traffic Organization (\"ATO\") is the operational arm of the FAA. The ATO is responsible for providing safe and efficient air navigation services to all of the United States and large portions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The Company is subject to any operational changes imposed by the FAA/ATO as they relate to the NextGen program, as well as the day-to-day management of the air traffic control system. 17 17 17 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Passenger and Occupational Health Regulation   The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to health and occupational safety, including Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d), Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Food and Drug Administration regulations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local government authorities implemented directives, orders, and regulations intended to mitigate the spread of the virus, and in response, the Company modified its practices, policies, and procedures, as appropriate. For example, the CDC and TSA issued orders, effective February 1, 2021, mandating the wearing of face masks on all commercial flights and within airports, subject to certain limited exceptions. On April 18, 2022, a federal judge in Florida struck down the federal mask mandate in transportation as outside of the CDC\u2019s authority. As a result of this development, the Company modified its policies to no longer require the wearing of masks onboard its aircraft.   New health requirements or standards, whether mandated by government agencies or voluntarily adopted by the Company, related to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise intended to mitigate the spread of communicable diseases could affect the Company\u2019s costs and performance.  For further information pertaining to the FAA\u2019s oversight and regulatory authority, as well as health and safety regulations related to COVID-19, see \u201cRisk Factors - Legal, Regulatory, Compliance, and Reputational Risks, and COVID-19 Risks.\u201d   Security Regulation  Pursuant to the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (\"ATSA\"), the TSA, a federal agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for certain civil aviation security matters. ATSA and subsequent TSA regulations and procedures implementing ATSA and related statutes address, among other things, (i) flight deck security; (ii) the use of federal air marshals onboard flights; (iii) airport and aircraft access security; (iv) airline crew security training; (v) security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees, and vendors; (vi) training and qualifications of security screening personnel; (vii) provision of passenger data to CBP; and (viii) background checks.  Under ATSA, substantially all security officers at airports are federal employees, and significant other elements of airline and airport security are overseen and performed by federal employees, including federal security managers, federal law enforcement officers, and federal air marshals. TSA personnel and TSA-mandated security procedures can affect the Company's operations, costs, and Customer experience. For example, as part of its security measures, the TSA regulates the types of liquid items that can be carried onboard aircraft. In addition, as part of its Secure Flight program, the TSA requires airlines to collect a passenger's full name (as it appears on a government-issued ID), date of birth, gender, and Redress Number (if applicable). Airlines must transmit this information to Secure Flight, which uses the information to perform matching against terrorist watch lists. After matching passenger information against the watch lists, Secure Flight transmits the matching results back to airlines. This serves to identify individuals for more extensive security screening and to prevent individuals on watch lists from boarding an aircraft. It also helps prevent the misidentification of passengers who have names similar to individuals on watch lists. The TSA's multi-layered, risk-based approach to airport security also includes physical pat down procedures at security checkpoints. These procedures have raised privacy concerns by some air travelers, and have caused delays at screening checkpoints.  The Company, in conjunction with the TSA, participates in TSA PreCheck\u2122, a pre-screening initiative that allows passengers deemed low risk by the TSA to move through security checkpoints with greater efficiency and ease when traveling. Eligible passengers may use dedicated screening lanes at certain airports the Company serves for screening benefits, which include leaving on shoes, light outerwear, and belts, as well as leaving laptops and permitted liquids in carryon bags. A similar CBP-administered program, Global Entry\u00ae, allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk international travelers upon arrival in the United States. The TSA has expressed its plans  18 18 18 Table of Contents Table of Contents to leverage advanced transportation security screening technologies, including biometric solutions, to improve security effectiveness and operational efficiency, while also enhancing the passenger experience. The advanced technologies have prompted privacy, cost, and legal concerns from air carriers, travelers, and advocacy groups, which could affect the timing and viability of the TSA's plans.  The Company also participates in the TSA Known Crewmember\u00ae program, which is a risk-based screening system that enables TSA security officers to positively verify the identity and employment status of flight-crew members. The program expedites flight crew member access to sterile areas of airports.  The Company works collaboratively with TSA, foreign national governments, and airports to provide risk-based security measures at international locations served by the Company.  The Company has made significant investments in facilities, equipment, and technology to process Customers, checked baggage, and cargo efficiently in compliance with applicable security regulations; however, the Company is not able to predict the impact, if any, that various security measures or TSA resource limitations at certain airports will have on Passenger revenues and the Company\u2019s costs, either in the short-term or the long-term.  Environmental Regulation  The Company is subject to various federal laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), as well as state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern aircraft drinking water, emissions, storm water discharges from operations, and the disposal of materials such as jet fuel, chemicals, hazardous waste, and aircraft deicing fluid.  Additionally, in conjunction with airport authorities, other airlines, and state and local environmental regulatory agencies, the Company, as a normal course of business, undertakes voluntary investigation or remediation of soil or groundwater contamination at various airport sites. The Company has not historically experienced any airport site environmental liability that has had a material adverse effect on its capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. However, many airports, as well as federal, state and local governmental authorities, are increasingly focused on groundwater contamination caused by what are sometimes referred to as \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d most notably per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\u201cPFAS\u201d). PFAS have been used in many manufacturing and industrial applications over many decades and can be found in numerous products, including building materials and household products. Most notably for aviation, PFAS are a key component in aqueous film-forming foam (\u201cAFFF\u201d), which are commonly available for use to fight petroleum-based fires at both commercial and military aviation facilities. The FAA and the U.S. Department of Defense have strict performance specifications for fire suppression systems, which has contributed to the use of AFFF/PFAS over the decades. PFAS is now the focus of regulatory oversight at airports, as well as the source of litigation by airports against AFFF manufacturers. Moreover, regulatory authorities at the federal, state, and local levels are contemplating both the prohibition of PFAS-based AFFF and costly remediation efforts at airports to address groundwater contamination. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\") is expected to finalize a rule listing two specific types of PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, which may be found in AFFF, as hazardous substances under CERCLA. The evolving legal and regulatory activity surrounding PFAS could lead to an inadequate supply of FAA-certified AFFF throughout the aviation system and/or increased operating costs at certain airports. Moreover, listing PFAS compounds under CERCLA may give rise to strict, joint and several liability for removal, remedial, response, and other costs, the costs of which could be material.  The federal government and the United Nations\u2019 International Civil Aviation Organization (\"ICAO\") have implemented legislative and regulatory proposals and introduced voluntary measures to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the federal level, in July 2016, the EPA issued a final endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions from certain types of aircraft engines, which the agency determined contribute to pollution that causes climate change and endangers public health and the environment. Following this endangerment  19 19 19 Table of Contents Table of Contents finding, per the federal Clean Air Act, the EPA adopted aircraft greenhouse gas emissions standards in December 2020. These standards apply to airframe and aircraft engine manufacturers, and align with the standards previously adopted by ICAO. On November 15, 2021, the EPA affirmed the agency will not reconsider the rule adopting the standards; however, several states and non-government organizations have filed legal petitions challenging the EPA\u2019s adoption of the rule, which remain unresolved at this time. The Company does not expect to incur any material costs related to the EPA\u2019s GHG aircraft rules at this time and the rules are not expected to adversely impact the Company's current aircraft fleet; however, the Company cannot guarantee that more stringent standards will not be adopted by the EPA in the future that could require material capital expenditures to modernize or replace its aircraft fleet or incur other costs related to GHG emissions from its aircraft.  In addition to aircraft emissions standards, ICAO implemented a \"global market-based measure\" framework in an effort to control carbon dioxide emissions from international aviation. The focal point of this framework is a carbon offsetting system applicable to aircraft operators designed to cap the growth of emissions related to international aviation. ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\") program is a global market-based measure intended to cap carbon emissions from international civil aviation at their 2019 levels from 2021 to 2023 and 85 percent of their 2019 levels from 2024 to 2035, addressing carbon emissions from the growth of international air traffic by requiring that international aviation emissions above these levels be offset or reduced through the use of CORSIA Eligible Fuel, such as a CORSIA sustainable aviation fuel, or CORSIA Eligible Emissions Units. The U.S. federal government has opted to participate in the voluntary phases of the CORSIA program from 2021-2026 (additional phases extend through 2035). As part of the CORSIA program, the Company is currently monitoring its international emissions for reporting purposes. Data collected from applicable international flight activity in 2019 forms the baseline and is used in the calculations to determine subsequent carbon offsetting requirements under the CORSIA program. To the extent CORSIA revises any of its emission accounting methodologies or options for meeting emission reduction levels, the Company could face increased costs to purchase additional volumes of SAF, carbon offsets, or take other measures to comply with the CORSIA program. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs related to its compliance with CORSIA; however, the Company could experience material costs as a result of any future expansion of its international operations, which would increase its compliance obligations under CORSIA, the need to purchase additional carbon offsets or volumes of SAF than what the Company has currently projected based on any changes to the CORSIA program, or other unforeseeable reasons given the evolving nature of climate change related laws, regulations, and programs. Regardless of the method of regulation or application of CORSIA, further policy changes with regard to climate change are possible, which could significantly increase operating costs in the airline industry and, as a result, adversely affect operations. Until the timing, scope, and extent of such future developments become known, the Company cannot predict their effect on the Company\u2019s cost structure or its operating results.  There are additional areas of federal rulemaking underway with respect to climate change-related matters that could also increase the Company\u2019s compliance obligations and costs and expenditures related to the same. In addition, to the extent these rules mandate additional disclosure on matters related to climate change, it is possible that such disclosures may impact lending or investment decisions of third parties, and consequently the Company could face greater restrictions on or increased costs of access to capital if the Company is not perceived as meeting any climate change-related standards established by such third parties. For example, on March 21, 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) proposed The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors. The proposed rule amendments would require a domestic or foreign registrant to include certain climate-related information in its registration statements and periodic reports, such as on Form 10-K, including: climate-related risks and their actual or likely material impacts on the registrant\u2019s business, strategy, and outlook; the registrant\u2019s governance of climate-related risks and relevant risk management processes; the registrant\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, which for accelerated and large accelerated filers and with respect to certain emissions, would be subject to assurance; certain climate-related financial statement metrics and related disclosures in a note to its audited financial statements; and information about climate-related targets and goals, and transition plan, if any. A final rule is expected in 2023. The Company may incur increased costs with respect to modifying existing disclosure controls, financial reporting practices, and the gathering and reporting of emissions data, in order to comply with the SEC\u2019s final rule. The Company could also face increased risks of litigation resulting from any enhanced disclosure requirements related to climate change. 20 20 20 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Separately, on November 10, 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration proposed the Federal Supplier Climate Risks and Resilience Rule, which would require major Federal contractors to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risks and set science-based emissions reduction targets verified by the Science-Based Target initiative and in accordance with third-party standards that preclude the use of carbon offsets to achieve emission reduction goals. The Company is currently monitoring the proposed rule; however, compliance with the rule as proposed could require the Company to incur increased costs in the form of increased reporting obligations, modify its operations to meet emission reduction targets, accelerate its fleet replacement plans, or otherwise revise or restate its existing sustainability goals.  In addition to climate change, aircraft noise continues to be an environmental focus, especially as the FAA implements new flight procedures as part of its NextGen airspace modernization program discussed above. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 gives airport operators the right, under certain circumstances, to implement local noise abatement programs, provided they do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system and meet other requirements. Some airports have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of operations. These types of restrictions can cause curtailments in service or increases in operating costs and can limit the ability of air carriers to expand operations at the affected airports.  At the federal level, the FAA has committed to inform and involve the public, engage with communities, and give meaningful consideration to community concerns and views when developing new flight procedures, and there is a possibility that Congress may enact legislation in the future to address local noise concerns at one or more commercial airports in the United States. In addition, the 2018 Reauthorization Act requires the FAA to consider community noise concerns when proposing a new navigation departure procedure or amending an existing navigation procedure that would direct aircraft over noise sensitive areas. This requirement could delay or otherwise impede the implementation or use of more efficient flight paths.  In general, government efforts at the international, federal, state, or local levels to address worldwide climate change, manage greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce aircraft noise, to the extent pursued or implemented, could affect the Company, aircraft operators, original equipment manufacturers, producers and sellers of aviation fuel, and other third parties on which the Company is dependent. Additional legislative or regulatory activity in this area could require modifications to the Company\u2019s equipment, operations, and strategy, and have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.  Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Regulation  The Company is subject to federal, state, and foreign laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personal information. The interpretation and application of many data privacy legal obligations is rapidly evolving. The Company continues to monitor a growing set of data privacy legal requirements, including with respect to consumer and employee access and control over personal information.  The Company has experienced heightened legislative and regulatory focus on cybersecurity, from both airline\u2011specific and broadly-applicable cybersecurity legal obligations. As a result, the Company must comply with a developing set of cybersecurity requirements including reporting, coordination, and affirmative risk\u2011management obligations related to information technology systems and operational technology systems.  The Company expects federal, state, and other governments to assess and implement increasingly challenging data privacy and cybersecurity legal obligations, which could result in expanded compliance burdens, costs, and enforcement risks for the Company.  International Regulation  21 21 21 Table of Contents Table of Contents All international air service is subject to certain U.S. federal requirements and approvals, as well as the regulatory requirements of the appropriate authorities of the foreign countries involved. Foreign regulatory agencies located in jurisdictions served by the Company can impose requirements on various aspects of the Company\u2019s business, including safety, marketing, ticket sales, staffing, and tax.  The Company has obtained the necessary economic authority from the DOT, as well as approvals required by the FAA and applicable foreign government entities, to conduct operations, under certain circumstances, to points outside of the continental United States currently served by the Company. Certain international authorities and approvals held by the Company are subject to periodic renewal requirements. The Company requests extensions of such authorities and approvals when and as appropriate. To the extent the Company seeks to serve additional foreign destinations in the future, or to renew its authority to serve certain routes, it may be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT and/or approvals from the FAA, as well as any applicable foreign government entity.  Certain international markets are governed by bilateral air transportation agreements between the United States and foreign countries. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of the Company's existing international authorities, present barriers to renewing existing or securing new authorities, or otherwise affect the Company's international operations. There are also capacity limitations at certain international airports, which could impact future service levels. In general, bilateral agreements between the United States and foreign countries the Company currently serves, or may serve in the future, may be subject to renegotiation or reinterpretation from time to time. While the U.S. government has negotiated \"open skies\" agreements with many countries, which allow for unrestricted access between the United States and respective foreign destinations, agreements with other countries may restrict the Company's entry into those destinations and/or its related growth opportunities.  The CBP is the federal agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security charged with facilitating international trade, collecting import duties, and enforcing U.S. regulations with respect to trade, customs, and immigration. To the extent the Company expands its international flight offerings, CBP and its requirements and resources will also become increasingly important considerations to the Company. For instance, with the exception of flights from a small number of foreign \"preclearance\" locations, arriving international flights may only land at CBP-designated airports, and CBP officers must be present and in sufficient numbers at those airports to effectively process and inspect arriving international passengers, baggage, and cargo. Thus, CBP personnel and CBP-mandated procedures can affect the Company's operations, costs, and Customer experience. The Company has made significant investments in facilities, equipment, and technologies at certain airports in order to improve the Customer experience and to assist CBP with its inspection and processing duties; however, the Company is not able to predict the impact, if any, that various CBP measures or the lack of CBP resources will have on the Company's revenues and costs, either in the short-term or the long-term.  Insurance  The Company carries insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts the Company deems adequate to protect the Company and its property and to comply both with applicable regulations and certain of the Company's credit and lease agreements. The policies principally provide coverage for public and passenger liability, property damage, pollution, D&O/fiduciary, cargo and baggage liability, loss or damage to aircraft, engines, and spare parts, and workers\u2019 compensation. In addition, the Company carries a cybersecurity insurance policy with regards to data protection and business interruption associated with both security breaches from malicious parties and from certain system failures. The Company also manages insured risk through the use of reinsurance programs, pooling mechanisms, and a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary.  Although the Company has been able to purchase aviation, property, liability, pollution, and D&O/fiduciary insurance via the commercial insurance marketplace, available commercial insurance could be more expensive in the future and/or have material differences in coverage than insurance that has historically been provided and may not be adequate to protect the Company's risk of loss from future events, including acts of terrorism and severe  22 22 22 Table of Contents Table of Contents weather events. Further, available cybersecurity insurance with regards to data protection and business interruption could be more expensive in the future and/or have material differences in coverage than insurance that has historically been provided and may not be adequate to protect the Company's risk of loss. With respect to any insurance claims, policy coverages and claims are subject to acceptance by the many insurers involved and may require arbitration, mediation, and/or litigation to effectively settle the claims over prolonged periods of time.  Competition  Competition within the airline industry is intense and highly unpredictable, and Southwest has historically competed with other airlines on virtually all of its scheduled routes. In recent years, the majority of domestic airline service has been provided by Southwest and the other largest major U.S. airlines, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines. The DOT defines major U.S. airlines as those airlines with annual revenues of at least $1 billion; there are currently 13 passenger airlines offering scheduled service, including Southwest, that meet this standard.  Key competitive factors within the airline industry have historically included (i) pricing and cost structure; (ii) routes, loyalty programs, and schedules; (iii) customer service, operational reliability, product offerings, and amenities; and (iv) balance sheet health. Airlines, including Southwest, also compete for customers with alternatives to travel, such as videoconferencing and business communication platforms. These alternatives have become particularly prevalent as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Pricing and Cost Structure  Pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry, and the availability of fare information on the Internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company experienced an increasingly competitive fare environment, as airlines offered significantly discounted fares to attempt to address unprecedented decreases in consumer demand.   Pricing can be driven by a variety of factors. For example, under normal circumstances, airlines may discount fares to drive traffic in new markets, stimulate traffic in existing markets, and/or grow market share in existing markets.  The Company believes its low-cost operating structure has historically provided it with an advantage over many of its airline competitors by enabling it to continue to charge low fares. In addition, the Company believes its low-cost operating structure provided it with a significant financial competitive advantage relative to many of its competitors in responding to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Routes, Loyalty Programs, and Schedules  The Company also competes with other airlines based on markets served, loyalty opportunities, and flight schedules. While the Company has a robust, route network in the United States, some major airlines have more extensive global route structures than Southwest, including more extensive international networks. In addition, many competitors have entered into significant commercial relationships with other airlines, such as strategic alliances, code-sharing, and capacity purchase agreements, which increase the airlines' opportunities to expand their route offerings. An alliance or code-sharing agreement enables an airline to offer flights that are operated by another airline and also allows the airline\u2019s customers to book travel that includes segments on different airlines through a single reservation or ticket. As a result, depending on the nature of the specific alliance or code-sharing arrangement, a participating airline may be able to, among other things, (i) offer its customers access to more destinations than it would be able to serve on its own, (ii) gain exposure in markets it does not otherwise serve, and (iii) increase the perceived frequency of its flights on certain routes. More extensive route structures, as well as alliance and code-sharing arrangements, not only provide additional route flexibility for participating airlines, they can also allow these airlines to offer their customers more opportunities to earn and redeem loyalty miles or points. A capacity purchase agreement enables an airline to expand its route structure by paying another airline (e.g., a regional airline with smaller aircraft) to operate flights on its behalf in markets that it does not, or cannot, serve  23 23 23 Table of Contents Table of Contents itself. The Company continues to evaluate and implement initiatives to better enable itself to offer additional itineraries, and has opened 18 new airports since the COVID-19 pandemic began, which has significantly increased its domestic route network.  Customer Service, Operational Reliability, Product Offerings, and Amenities  Southwest also competes with other airlines with respect to customer service, operational reliability (such as ontime performance), product offerings, and passenger amenities. According to statistics published by the DOT, Southwest has historically ranked at or near the top among domestic carriers in Customer Satisfaction for having the lowest customer complaint ratio. However, in particular in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, carriers are increasingly focusing on customer-friendly policies as opportunities to win and retain customers. In addition, some airlines have more seating options and associated passenger amenities than Southwest, including first class, business class, and other premium seating and related amenities, which can appeal in particular to business customers. However, the Company believes its introduction of its fares in the Global Distribution Systems (GDS) provides an opportunity to increase the Company's market share of business customers. New and different types of aircraft flown by competitors could have operational attributes and passenger amenities that could be considered more attractive to certain consumers than those associated with the Company's existing fleet. The Company believes its Customer Service and flexible Customer and Rapid Rewards policies continue to positively differentiate it from many of its competitors.  Balance Sheet Health  The Company believes it is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic with a strengthened financial position relative to its competitors in the U.S. airline industry, which has put the Company in a better position to support future growth. Further, the Company has maintained its investment-grade rating by all three major credit agencies (Moody\u2019s, S&P Global, and Fitch) throughout the pandemic, and is currently the only major U.S. passenger airline with an investment-grade rating. The Company believes its balance sheet provided it advantaged access to liquidity during the pandemic.  Other Forms of Competition  Technology advancements have provided alternatives to air travel, such as videoconferencing, business communication platforms, and the Internet, and these alternatives significantly increased in scope during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company is subject to the risk that the significantly increased use of these alternatives could result in permanent changes to consumer behavior and thereby negatively affect demand for air travel.  The airline industry is also subject to varying degrees of competition from other forms of transportation, including surface transportation by automobiles, buses, and trains. Inconveniences and delays associated with air travel security measures can increase surface competition. In addition, surface competition can be significant during economic downturns when consumers cut back on discretionary spending and fewer choose to fly, or when gasoline prices are lower, making surface transportation a less expensive option. Because of the relatively high percentage of short-haul travel provided by Southwest, it is particularly exposed to competition from surface transportation in these instances.   Seasonality  The Company's business is ordinarily seasonal. Generally, in most markets the Company serves, demand for air travel is greater during the summer months, and, therefore, revenues in the airline industry tend to be stronger in the second (April 1 - June 30) and third (July 1 - September 30) quarters of the year than in the first (January 1 - March 31) and fourth (October 1 - December 31) quarters of the year. As a result, in many cases, the Company's results of operations reflect this seasonality. Factors that could alter this seasonality include, among others, global pandemics such as COVID-19, the price of fuel, general economic conditions, changes in consumer behavior, governmental action, extreme or severe weather and natural disasters, fears of terrorism or war, or changes in the competitive  24 24 24 Table of Contents Table of Contents environment. Therefore, the Company's quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.  Employees  Total Employees and Labor Union Activity  At December 31, 2022, the Company had 66,656 active full-time equivalent Employees, consisting of 28,199 air operations (including Pilots, Flight Attendants, Dispatchers, Flight Simulator Technicians, Flight Crew Training Instructors, and Meteorologists), 19,679 ground operations (including Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight Agents, and Customer Service Agents), 3,275 Customer Representatives and Source of Support Representatives, 3,458 maintenance and engineering (including Material Specialists, Mechanics, Aircraft Appearance Technicians, and Facilities Maintenance Technicians), and 12,045 additional \u201cnoncontract\u201d Employees. The Company has consistently utilized active full-time equivalent Employees to determine various metrics that measure productivity and efficiency, so it has chosen to not include inactive Employees in the figure, which totaled an additional 4,060 Employees as of December\u00a031, 2022. In addition, the active full-time equivalent Employees figure includes an adjustment to count all part-time Employees as a 0.5 full-time equivalent Employee. The Company continues to focus on its hiring needs to meet schedule demands. The labor force participation rate remains depressed despite an increase in jobs, especially in the transportation and hospitality industries. There is an ongoing battle for talent, leading to less candidate supply and a decline in qualified candidates.   Approximately 83 percent of Company Employees at December 31, 2022, were represented by labor unions. The Company uses active full-time equivalent Employees to measure productivity and efficiency, but when considering total demographics of Employees, the Company looks at total headcount, active and inactive Employees, irrespective of part-time or full-time status. The Railway Labor Act establishes the right of airline employees to organize and bargain collectively. Under the Railway Labor Act, collective-bargaining agreements between an airline and a labor union generally do not expire, but instead become amendable as of an agreed date. By the amendable date, if either party wishes to modify the terms of the agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner required by the Railway Labor Act and/or described in the agreement. After receipt of the notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations. If no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board to appoint a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the National Mediation Board may determine an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration to the parties. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a 30-day \"cooling off\" period begins. At the end of this 30-day period, the parties may engage in \"self-help,\" unless a Presidential Emergency Board is established to investigate and report on the dispute. The appointment of a Presidential Emergency Board maintains the \"status quo\" for an additional period of time. If the parties do not reach agreement during this period, the parties may then engage in \"self-help.\" \"Self-help\" includes, among other things, a strike by the union or the airline\u2019s imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.  The following table sets forth the Company's Employee groups subject to collective bargaining and the status of their respective collective-bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2022:  25 25 25 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Employee GroupApproximate Number of Full-time Equivalent EmployeesRepresentativesStatus of AgreementSouthwest Pilots9,342Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association (\"SWAPA\")In negotiationsSouthwest Flight Attendants18,105Transportation Workers of America, AFL-CIO, Local 556 (\"TWU 556\")In negotiationsSouthwest Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, Freight Agents15,260Transportation Workers of America, AFL-CIO, Local 555 (\"TWU 555\")In negotiationsSouthwest Customer Service Agents, Customer Representatives, and Source of Support Representatives7,694International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO (\"IAM 142\")Amendable December 2027Southwest Material Specialists (formerly known as Stock Clerks)448International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 19 (\"IBT 19\")Amendable April 2024Southwest Mechanics2,766Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (\"AMFA\")Amendable August 2024Southwest Aircraft Appearance Technicians194AMFAAmendable July 2027Southwest Facilities Maintenance Technicians50AMFAIn negotiations.

The Company has implemented many programs designed to achieve these priorities, including strong Employee training and benefits programs. The Company's vast Employee training and development opportunities address, among other things, leadership development; diversity, equity, and inclusion; communication skills; and human trafficking awareness. The Company rewards Employees with competitive compensation and benefits packages, including attractive medical plans, a 401(k) plan with a dollar-for-dollar match for Employees other than Pilots (subject to vesting requirements and certain compensation limits), a 401(k) plan with a non-elective contribution of 15 percent for Pilots, and a profit sharing plan.  The Company regularly conducts Employee surveys to assess job satisfaction of its Employees, and uses information from the surveys to improve the Company\u2019s ability to attract, develop, and retain talented Employees who will help advance the Company. For many years, the bonus opportunity for the Company's senior leadership  26 26 26 Table of Contents Table of Contents group, including its executive officers, has been tied to the Company's performance relative to multiple pre-established performance metrics, which have from time to time included the Company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) initiatives and/or the Company's voluntary turnover rate for Employees. In addition to bonus opportunities for the Company\u2019s senior leadership group, the Company has implemented performance-based compensation programs for other non-contract Employee leaders, including managers, supervisors, team leads, and certain other Employees.  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  DEI is also an integral part of the Company\u2019s culture and processes that support recruitment, hiring, training, retention, and advancement. In an effort to advance the Company's DEI, the Company has established the following goals:  \u2022Evolve hiring and development practices to support diversity goals, including posting all open Leadership positions (Supervisor to Vice President) and requiring diverse candidate slates for each role;  \u2022Measure progress in increasing diversity in Senior Leadership;  \u2022Double the percentage of racial diversity and increase gender diversity in the Company\u2019s Senior Management Committee by 2025; and \u2022Engaging the Company\u2019s breadth of community partners to leverage relationships in sourcing diverse talent.  Additionally, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors is seeking to increase its diverse representation by 2025. The Company has a dedicated DEI Department that provides regular updates to the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. To advance the Company's goals with respect to inclusion, the DEI Department has launched a multi-year training plan to increase the cultural competency of the Company's workforce.  The Company has taken tangible steps to update the required infrastructure, processes, and practices to meet these objectives. The DEI Department formed an Executive Steering Committee to support the strategic direction of this progress. In addition, the Company evolved its talent acquisition processes by requiring diverse candidate pools for leadership positions, deploying inclusion training for all hiring Leaders, and creating a Diversity Recruiting Center of Excellence. The Company also works with community partners in support of its efforts to continue developing diverse and inclusive talent pipelines and expanding recruiting efforts. The Company also recently launched a formal Sponsorship and Mentorship Program. In addition to current initiatives, the DEI Department has established a five-year enterprise strategic plan to continue advancing DEI efforts throughout the organization. The Company's motivation is to be a healthy organization where Employees thrive, feel appreciated, valued, and have an authentic sense of belonging.  In 2022, the Company also published its first ever DEI Report. A companion piece to the Southwest One Report, the DEI Report takes a deeper dive into the Company's DEI goals and initiatives and highlights the expected path forward. Information contained in the DEI Report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Form 10-K. While the Company believes that the disclosures contained in the DEI Report and other voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters are responsive to various areas of investor interest, the Company believes that certain of these disclosures do not currently address matters that are material in the near term to the Company\u2019s operations, strategy, financial condition, or financial results, although this view may change in the future based on new information that could materially alter the estimates, assumptions, or timelines used to create these disclosures. Given the estimates, assumptions, and timelines used to create the DEI Report and other voluntary disclosures, the materiality of these disclosures is inherently difficult to assess in advance.

Forward-looking statements are based on, and include statements about, the Company\u2019s estimates, expectations, beliefs, intentions, and strategies for the future, and the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements. Specific forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and include, without limitation, words such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"plans,\" \"goal,\" and similar expressions. Although management believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the Company's forward-looking statements or from historical experience or the Company's present expectations. Known material risk factors that could cause these differences are set forth below under \"Risk Factors.\" Additional risks or uncertainties (i) that are not currently known to the Company, (ii) that the Company currently deems to be immaterial, or (iii) that could apply to any company, could also materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, or future results.  Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the Company's forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's views only as of the date this Form 10-K is filed. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.   ", "time": "00:00:05"}
