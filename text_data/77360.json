GENERAL At Pentair, we help the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, life\u2019s most essential resource. From our residential and commercial water solutions to industrial water management and everything in between, Pentair is focused on creating a better world for people and our planet through smart, sustainable water solutions.  Pentair strategy Our vision is to be the world\u2019s most valued sustainable water solutions company for our employees, customers and shareholders. As a company, we:  \u2022Focus on growth in our core businesses and strategic initiatives; \u2022Accelerate digital, innovation, technology and environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) investments; \u2022Expedite growth and drive margin expansion through our transformation program; and \u2022Build a high performance growth culture and deliver on our commitments while living our Win Right values. HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT We are an Irish public limited company that was formed in 2014. We are the successor to Pentair Ltd., a Swiss corporation formed in 2012, and Pentair, Inc., a Minnesota corporation formed in 1966 and our wholly-owned subsidiary, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Although our jurisdiction of organization is Ireland, we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) and therefore have our tax residency in the U.K.  On July 28, 2022, as part of our Consumer Solutions reporting segment, we acquired the issued and outstanding equity securities of certain subsidiaries of Welbilt, Inc. (\u201cWelbilt\u201d) and certain other assets, rights, and properties, and assumed certain liabilities, comprising Welbilt\u2019s Manitowoc Ice business (\u201cManitowoc Ice\u201d), for approximately $1.6\u00a0billion in cash. Our registered principal office is located at Regal House, 70 London Road, Twickenham, London, TW13QS United Kingdom. Our management office in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) is located at 5500 Wayzata Boulevard, Suite 900, Golden Valley, Minnesota. BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS The following is a brief description of each of the Company\u2019s 2022 reportable segments and business activities. Effective January 1, 2023, we reorganized our segments, going from two segments to three with the three segments being Pool, Water Solutions and Industrial & Flow Technologies. The discussions below that speak to historical periods refer to the prior segments, while statements about present and future periods refer to the businesses underlying those segments and carry forward with those businesses (including our customers, seasonality and competition) in their re-segmented form. Additional information regarding this re-segmentation is found below under the section titled \u201cNew Segmentation.\u201d Consumer Solutions The Consumer Solutions segment designs, manufactures and sells energy-efficient residential and commercial pool equipment and accessories, and commercial and residential water treatment products and systems. Residential and commercial pool equipment and accessories include pumps, filters, heaters, lights, automatic controls, automatic cleaners, maintenance equipment and pool accessories. Water treatment products and systems include pressure tanks, control valves, activated carbon products, commercial ice machines, conventional filtration products, and point-of-entry and point-of-use systems. Applications for our pool business\u2019s products include residential and commercial pool maintenance, repair, renovation, service and construction. Our water treatment products and systems are used in residential whole home water filtration, drinking water filtration and water softening solutions in addition to commercial total water management and filtration in food service operations. In addition, our water solutions business also provides installation and preventative services for water management solutions for commercial operators. The primary focus of this segment is business-to-consumer.  For the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2022, our pool business comprised approximately 60% of the Consumer Solutions sales. The pool business is a leader in North American pool equipment, serving an end market that is primarily replacement.  1 1 1   The other approximately 40% of sales were from the water treatment and water solutions businesses, which sell residential and commercial components, residential systems, commercial systems and commercial ice machines.  Consumer Solutions brand names include Everpure, KBI, Kreepy Krauly, Manitowoc Ice, Pleatco, RainSoft and Sta-Rite. Customers Consumer Solutions customers include businesses engaged in wholesale and retail distribution in the residential and commercial vertical markets. Customers also include end-users, consumers, commercial operators and original equipment manufacturers.  One customer in the Consumer Solutions\u2019 pool business represented approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales in 2022 and 2021.  Seasonality We have historically experienced seasonal demand with several end-customers and end-users within Consumer Solutions. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and historically has been at seasonal highs from April to August. The magnitude of the sales spike has historically been partially mitigated by employing some advance sale \u201cearly buy\u201d programs (generally including extended payment terms and/or additional discounts).  Competition Consumer Solutions faces numerous domestic and international competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the vertical markets in which we compete. Competition focuses on brand names, product performance (including energy-efficient offerings and required specifications), quality, service and price. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high-quality products, which are competitively priced. We believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also provide us a competitive advantage. Industrial & Flow Technologies The Industrial & Flow Technologies segment manufactures and sells a variety of fluid treatment products (advanced membrane filtration, separation systems, membrane bioreactors), pumps (water supply pumps, water disposal pumps, solid handling pumps, fluid transfer pumps, turbine pumps), valves, and spray nozzles as well as systems combining these products (process filtration systems, gas recovery solutions). These products and systems serve the global residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural and infrastructure vertical markets. They are used in a range of applications, food and beverage, fluid separation technologies (oil and gas and other industries), water and wastewater treatment, water wells, pressure boosting, fire suppression, flood control, agricultural irrigation, crop spray and fluid circulation and transfer. The primary focus of this segment is business-to-business. For the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2022, our residential and irrigation flow businesses comprised approximately 45% of the Industrial & Flow Technologies sales. The residential and irrigation flow businesses sell pumps focused on residential and agriculture. Another approximately 25% of sales were from the commercial & infrastructure flow businesses, which sell larger pumps focused on fire suppression, waste water and flood control. The remaining approximately 30% of sales were from the industrial solutions business, comprised of applications focused on industrial process filtration and sustainable gas. Industrial & Flow Technologies brand names include Pentair, Aurora, Berkeley, Codeline, Fairbanks-Nijhuis, Haffmans, Hydromatic, Hypro, Jung Pumpen, Myers, Sta-Rite, Shurflo, S\u00fcdmo and X-Flow. Customers Industrial & Flow Technologies customers include businesses engaged with end users, and wholesale and retail distribution in the residential, commercial, food & beverage and industrial vertical markets. Seasonality We have historically experienced increased demand for residential water supply and irrigation pumps following weather trends, which historically has been at seasonal highs from April to August. Seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns, particularly by temperatures, heavy flooding and droughts.  Competition Industrial & Flow Technologies faces numerous domestic and international competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the vertical markets in which we compete. Competition focuses on brand names, product performance (including energy-efficient offerings and required specifications), quality, service and price. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high-quality products, which are competitively priced.   2 2 2   NEW SEGMENTATION  Effective January 1, 2023, we reorganized our reporting segments to reflect how we are managing our business beginning in 2023. We believe the new alignment into three segments, Pool, Water Solutions and Industrial & Flow Technologies, will help us accelerate our efforts to improve customer experiences, differentiate our products and drive profitability for our shareholders.  As part of this reorganization, the legacy Consumer Solutions segment was divided into a Pool segment and a Water Solutions segment. The Industrial & Flow Technologies segment remains the same. All segment information presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, with the exception of the table below, was prepared based on the reporting segments in place during 2022.  The below table presents net sales and segment income under the revised reporting segments (Pool, Water Solutions, and Industrial & Flow Technologies) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

These efforts consist mostly of the development of new products, product applications and manufacturing processes. Raw materials The principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are mild steel, stainless steel, electronic components (including drives and motors), plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies), copper and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution for resale. We purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market, and the majority are available through multiple sources. Supplier capabilities were stressed in 2022 and 2021 compared to previous years as a result of various degrees of supply chain challenges, including reduced labor availability and increased lead times for electronic components and other raw materials due to availability constraints and high demand. We have certain long-term commitments, principally price commitments, for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and continue to work with our suppliers to maintain delivery continuity. Alternate sources of supply are available for most materials and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain commodities, such as metals and resins, are subject to commodity market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances. Prices for raw materials, such as metals, resins and electronics, may trend higher in the near future due to the existing inflationary market trends. 3 3 3   Intellectual property Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trademarks, trade names and brand names are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer relationship, trademark, trade name or brand name. Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of patents, patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Human capital resources We believe our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain strong employees. We believe a deep-rooted culture energizes our employees to make a difference within and beyond the workplace. We strive to be the destination for top talent, and work hard to develop and retain high performers throughout their career. We also believe our Win Right values, positive culture and commitment to inclusion and diversity foster innovation and curiosity, which, in turn, contribute to us being an industry leader. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 11,250 employees worldwide, of which approximately 53% are located in the U.S. A small portion of our U.S. employees are unionized, while outside the U.S., we have employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association. Employee engagement and development Engaging our employees and developing their careers is important to our long-term success and ties directly to our Win Right culture and values. We engage with our employees and gather feedback about our employee programs, practices and policies through various approaches that include: town hall meetings where Pentair leaders share strategies and perspectives; quarterly leadership webcasts to help ensure our results and expectations are clearly communicated; an annual global leadership meeting to help drive growth and productivity initiatives and share best practices; and a feedback feature on our employee intranet. In addition, we periodically conduct employee engagement and culture surveys to gauge the level of engagement and actions needed on culture, engagement and retention. Training and development To support employees in their career journey, we have developed and shared through our employee intranet a number of tools and resources. These resources include: live training sessions; on-demand eLearning and virtual classrooms; and downloadable materials. Additionally, our annual talent management process allows employees to build development plans with their leaders to advance their careers. Our talent development efforts span across all levels of our organization, including our campus Leadership Development Program, a 36-month program in which future leaders participate in rotations intended to develop their capabilities through organization-wide exposure, and our Growth Manager development programs that prepare our new and experienced managers to be more effective and inclusive leaders at Pentair.  Inclusion and diversity Our commitment to inclusion and diversity is part of living our Win Right values. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain a diverse group of employees. We believe an inclusive and diverse workforce contributes different perspectives and innovative ideas that enable us to improve every day. We believe that every employee should be provided the same opportunity to be heard, respected, have a sense of belonging and contribute to our mission. Race, gender, ethnicity, country of origin, age, personal style, sexual orientation, physical ability, religion, life experiences and many more factors contribute to this diversity. Our Business Resource Groups have been put into place to help promote a culture of inclusion through employees providing feedback and sponsoring awareness, education and engagement. 4 4 4   Our statistics are a measure of our performance, and we are committed to advancing a diverse workplace. The following sets forth information regarding the diversity of our workforce as of December 31, 2022:  Percent of workforcePercent of leadership roles (3)Minorities (1)40%25%Women (2)32%32%(1) Inclusive of the following racial minority groups: Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander.

We take an integrated approach to supporting and promoting workplace inclusion and diversity including: ensuring leadership involvement and ownership; attracting and retaining diverse talent at all levels; fostering a globally aware, inclusive culture; and ensuring our practices are fair and nondiscriminatory. In addition, we promote an inclusive and diverse workplace through: a training called the \u201cThe Power of Inclusion\u201d; Business Resource Groups led by employees; Pentair\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and an Inclusion and Diversity Hub on our company\u2019s intranet.  Health, safety and wellness We are committed to providing a safe workplace for all of our employees. We encourage employees to \u201cStop Work\u201d anytime there is a potential concern regarding worker safety, and promote an open door policy so that all of our employees feel free to speak to their manager if there are any potential health, safety, compliance or sustainability concerns. Additionally, each site maintains a confidential reporting process, and we encourage the use of the Ethics Hotline for employees to report anonymously potential safety concerns. All locations, enterprise wide, must meet and/or exceed regulatory agency standards as applicable to each plant\u2019s location. Compensation and benefits In the U.S., all non-union full-time employees are eligible to receive the following benefits: short-term and long-term disability insurance; flexible and health savings accounts and wellness programs; health insurance (medical, pharmacy, dental); eight weeks paid parental leave for birth, adoptive and foster parents; two weeks paid caregiver leave; legal services; retirement benefits; stock ownership; tuition reimbursement; holidays; vacation and sick time. Union employee benefits vary by contract.  ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) Activities As a leading provider of water treatment and sustainable solutions and with a foundation of Win Right values, we recognize that the work we do and the products and services we provide help to improve lives and the environment around the world. Pentair strives to be a positive influence on the social and environmental issues of today. As we progress, we are focused on building on our Win Right values and culture by further contributing to the development of a sustainable and responsible society that we believe will also drive our future growth. We are also focused on further integrating our ESG goals throughout our business by creating broad accountability for our social responsibility strategy and creating shared commitments and targets. We have established a formal social responsibility program to further advance our social responsibility goals. In 2020, Pentair completed a formal ESG assessment to identify ESG topics of importance to our shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and communities. Through engagement with these stakeholders, internal business leaders and subject matter experts, we identified ESG goals, which ultimately culminated into Pentair\u2019s Social Responsibility Targets, which we announced in 2021.  Annually, we publish a corporate responsibility report on our ESG and social responsibility activities and accomplishments, which can be found on our corporate website, and which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
