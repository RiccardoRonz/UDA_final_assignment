Through our broad product offering, we are a single source supplier of phosphate- and potash-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients. We serve customers in approximately 40 countries. We are the second largest integrated phosphate producer in the world and one of the largest producers and marketers of phosphate-based animal feed ingredients in North America and Brazil. We are the leading fertilizer production and distribution company in Brazil. We mine phosphate rock in Florida, Brazil and Peru. We process rock into finished phosphate products at facilities in Florida, Louisiana and Brazil. We are typically one of the top four global potash producers in the world. In 2022, we were the second-largest producer, with our position lifted by reduced production in Belarus and Russia. We mine potash in Saskatchewan, New Mexico and Brazil. We have other production, blending or distribution operations in Brazil, China, India and Paraguay, as well as a strategic equity investment in a joint venture that operates a phosphate rock mine and chemical complexes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our operations serve the top four nutrient-consuming countries in the world: China, India, U.S. and Brazil. The Mosaic Company is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in March 2004 and serves as the parent company of the business that was formed through the October 2004 combination of IMC Global Inc. (\u201cIMC\u201d) and the fertilizer businesses of Cargill, Incorporated. We are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cMOS\u201d and are headquartered in Tampa, Florida. We conduct our business through wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries as well as businesses in which we own less than a majority or a non-controlling interest. We are organized into three reportable business segments: Phosphates, Potash and Mosaic Fertilizantes. Intersegment eliminations, unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses on derivatives, debt expenses, Streamsong Resort\u00ae results of operations, and the results of the China and India distribution businesses are included within Corporate, Eliminations and Other. The following charts show the respective contributions to 2022 sales volumes, net sales and gross margin for each of our business segments in effect at December 31, 2022:  We account for approximately 12% of estimated global annual phosphate production. We also account for approximately 14% of estimated global annual potash production.  1  1  1 Table of Content Table of Content Phosphates Segment\u2013We sell phosphate-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients throughout North America and internationally. We account for approximately 69% of estimated North American annual production of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients.

Business Developments during 2022 \u2022In the first quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors approved the establishment of a new $1.0 billion share repurchase authorization, which was completed in the second quarter of 2022. Our Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2022.  \u2022During 2022, we repurchased 30,810,173 shares of Common Stock in the open market for approximately $1.7 billion. This includes 7,056,229 shares we purchased under an accelerated share repurchase agreement in 2022.  \u2022In the first quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors approved a regular dividend increase to $0.60 per share annually from $0.45, beginning with the second quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors increased the dividend to $0.80 per share annually, beginning with the dividend declared on December 16, 2022. \u2022In November 2022, we paid the outstanding balance of $550\u00a0million on our 3.25% senior notes, due November 15, 2022, without premium or penalty. On January 12, 2023, we completed the sale of the Streamsong Resort\u00ae (the \u201cResort\u201d) and approximately 7,000 acres of land on which it sits for a purchase price of $160 million. The Resort is a destination resort and conference center, which we developed in an area of previously mined land as part of our long-term business strategy to maximize the value and utility of our extensive land holdings in Florida. In addition to a hotel and conference center, the Resort includes multiple golf courses, a clubhouse and ancillary facilities. Subsequent to year end, our Board of Directors approved an accelerated share repurchase (\u201cASR\u201d) of $300\u00a0million which is expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2023. Also, in February 2023, the Board of Directors approved a special dividend of $0.25 per share to be distributed in March, 2023 to our stockholders of record as of March 15, 2023.  We have included additional information about these and other developments in our business during 2022 in our Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cManagement\u2019s Analysis\u201d) and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Throughout the discussion below, we measure units of production, sales and raw materials in metric tonnes, which are the equivalent of 2,205 pounds, or 1.102 tons (U.S. standard), unless we specifically state that we mean short or long ton(s), which are the equivalent of 2,000 pounds and 2,240 pounds, respectively. In addition, we measure natural gas, a raw material   2  2  2 Table of Content Table of Content used in the production of our products, in MM BTU, which stands for one million British Thermal Units (\u201cBTU\u201d). One BTU is equivalent to 1.06 Joules. Information concerning our mining properties in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been prepared in accordance with Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (\u201cS-K 1300\u201d). S-K 1300 requires us to disclose our mineral resources, in addition to our mineral reserves, as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year, both in the aggregate and for each of our individually material mining properties. We have four material properties: Belle Plaine, Esterhazy, Florida and Tapira. See Item 2. \u201cProperties,\u201d for further information regarding mineral reserves and resource and discussion of our material mining properties. This report includes market share and industry data and forecasts that we obtained from publicly available information and industry publications, surveys, market research, internal company surveys and consultant surveys. We believe these sources to be reliable, but there can be no assurance as to the accuracy and completeness of such information. We have not independently verified the data from third-party sources, nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. Similarly, internal company surveys, industry forecasts and market research, which we believe to be reliable based upon management\u2019s knowledge of the industry, have not been verified by any independent sources.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION The discussion below of our business segment operations should be read in conjunction with the following information that we have included in this report: \u2022The risk factors discussed in this report in Part I, Item\u00a01A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. \u2022Our Management\u2019s Analysis. \u2022The financial statements and supplementary financial information in our Consolidated Financial Statements (\u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d). This information is incorporated by reference into this section from Part II, Item\u00a08, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.  Phosphates Segment Our Phosphates business segment owns and operates mines and production facilities in Florida which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and phosphate-based animal feed ingredients, and processing plants in Louisiana which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients. We have a 75% economic interest in the Miski Mayo Phosphate Mine in Peru (\u201cMiski Mayo Mine\u201d), which is included in the results of our Phosphates segment.  The following map shows the locations of each of our phosphate concentrates plants in the U.S. and each of our active, temporarily idled, and planned phosphate mine locations, including beneficiation plants, in Florida. The reserves associated with our Ona, Florida location have been allocated to other active mines based on our future mining plans:  3  3  3 Table of Content Table of Content  U.S. Phosphate Crop Nutrients and Animal Feed Ingredients Our U.S. Phosphate operations have capacity to produce approximately 4.5 million\u00a0tonnes of phosphoric acid (\u201cP2O5\u201d) per year, or about 7% of world annual capacity and about 60% of North American annual capacity. P2O5 is produced by reacting finely ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. P2O5 is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry. Our U.S. P2O5 production totaled approximately 3.0 million tonnes during 2022. Our U.S. operations account for approximately 7% of estimated global annual production and 50% of estimated North American annual output. Our phosphate crop nutrient products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers, distributors, retailers and farmers. Our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are: \u2022Diammonium Phosphate (18-46-0): Diammonium Phosphate (\u201cDAP\u201d) is the most widely used high-analysis phosphate crop nutrient worldwide. DAP is produced by first combining phosphoric acid with anhydrous ammonia in a reaction vessel. This initial reaction creates a slurry that is then pumped into a granulation plant where it is reacted with additional ammonia to produce DAP. DAP is a solid granular product that is applied directly or blended with other solid plant nutrient products, such as urea and potash. \u2022Monoammonium Phosphate (11-52-0): Monoammonium Phosphate (\u201cMAP\u201d) is the second most widely used high-analysis phosphate crop nutrient and the fastest growing phosphate product worldwide. MAP is also produced by first combining phosphoric acid with anhydrous ammonia in a reaction vessel. The resulting slurry is then pumped into the granulation plant where it is reacted with additional P2O5 to produce MAP. MAP is a solid granular product that is applied directly or blended with other solid plant nutrient products.  4  4  4 Table of Content Table of Content \u2022MicroEssentials\u00ae is a value-added ammoniated phosphate product that is enhanced through a patented process that creates very thin platelets of sulfur and other micronutrients, such as zinc, on the granulated product. The patented process incorporates both the sulfate and elemental forms of sulfur, providing season-long availability to crops. Production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our New Wales, Florida facility. We market our feed phosphate primarily under the leading brand names of Biofos\u00ae and Nexfos\u00ae. Annual capacity by plant as of December\u00a031, 2022 and production volumes by plant for 2022 are listed below: (tonnes in millions)Phosphoric AcidProcessed\u00a0Phosphate(a)/DAP/MAP/ MicroEssentials\u00ae/Feed Phosphate\u00a0Operational Capacity(b)Operational Capacity(b)FacilityProduction(c)Production(c)Florida:Bartow1.1\u00a00.8\u00a02.5\u00a01.8\u00a0New Wales1.7\u00a01.1\u00a04.0\u00a02.5\u00a0Riverview0.9\u00a00.6\u00a01.8\u00a01.3\u00a03.7\u00a02.5\u00a08.3\u00a05.6\u00a0Louisiana:Faustina\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a01.6\u00a01.1\u00a0Uncle Sam0.8\u00a00.5\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a00.8\u00a00.5\u00a01.6\u00a01.1\u00a0Total4.5\u00a03.0\u00a09.9\u00a06.7\u00a0 Processed\u00a0Phosphate(a)/DAP/MAP/ MicroEssentials\u00ae/Feed Phosphate Operational Capacity(b) Operational Capacity(b) Production(c) Production(c) ______________________________ (a)Our ability to produce processed phosphates has been less than our annual operational capacity stated in the table above, except to the extent we purchase P2O5. Factors affecting actual production are described in note (c) below. (b)Operational capacity is our estimated long-term capacity based on an average amount of scheduled down time, including maintenance and scheduled turnaround time, and product mix, and no significant modifications to operating conditions, equipment or facilities. (c)Actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the above table due to factors that include, among others, the level of demand for our products, maintenance and turnaround time, accidents, mechanical failure, product mix, and other operating conditions. The P2O5 produced at Uncle Sam is shipped to Faustina, where it is used to produce DAP, MAP and MicroEssentials\u00ae. Our Faustina plant also manufactures ammonia that is mostly consumed in our concentrate plants. We produced approximately 6.3 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2022 and accounted for approximately 69% of estimated North American annual production. Phosphate Rock Phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate. Our Florida phosphate rock mines produced approximately 10.5\u00a0million tonnes in 2022 and accounted for approximately 47% of estimated North American annual production. We are the world\u2019s second largest miner of phosphate rock (excluding China) and currently operate four mines in North America with a combined annual capacity of approximately 18.0\u00a0million tonnes. Additionally, we own 75% of the Miski Mayo Mine, which has an annual capacity of 4.0 million tonnes. Production of one tonne of DAP requires between 1.6 and 1.7 tonnes of phosphate rock. All of our wholly-owned phosphate mines and related mining operations in North America are located in central Florida. During 2022, we operated three active mines in Florida: Four Corners, South Fort Meade and Wingate. We plan to explore and develop the DeSoto property and the South Pasture property, which was previously idled, to offset future depletion at our Florida properties. We have a 75% economic interest in the Miski Mayo Mine, which allows us to supplement our other produced rock to meet our overall fertilizer production needs and is the primary source of rock for our Louisiana operations. We have the right to use or sell to third parties 75% of the Miski Mayo Mine\u2019s annual production.  5  5  5 Table of Content Table of Content See Item 2. \u201cProperties\u201d for a discussion of our phosphate mining properties, including processing methods, facilities, production and summaries of our mineral resources and reserves, both in the aggregate and for our individual material phosphate mining properties. Investment in Ma\u2019aden Wa\u2019ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company (\u201cMWSPC\u201d) We own a 25% interest in MWSPC and, in connection with our equity share, we are entitled to market approximately 25% of MWSPC\u2019s production. MWSPC consists of a mine and two chemical complexes (the \u201cProject\u201d) that produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream phosphates products in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The greenfield project was built in the northern region of Saudi Arabia at Wa\u2019ad Al Shamal Minerals Industrial City and included further expansion of processing plants in Ras Al Khair Minerals Industrial City, which is located on the east coast of Saudi Arabia. Ammonia operations commenced in late 2016 and on December 1, 2018, MWSPC commenced commercial operations of the phosphate plant, thereby bringing the entire project to the commercial production phase. Phosphate production will ramp-up until it reaches an expected 3.0 million tonnes in annual production capacity. Actual phosphate production was 2.6 million tonnes in 2022. The Project benefits from the availability of key raw nutrients from sources within Saudi Arabia. Sulfur We use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid, primarily for use in our production of P2O5. We purchased approximately 3.4\u00a0million long tons of sulfur during 2022. We purchase the majority of this sulfur from North American oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process. Production of one tonne of DAP requires approximately 0.40 long tons of sulfur. We procure our sulfur from multiple sources and receive it by truck, rail, barge and vessel, either directly at our phosphate plants or have it sent for gathering to terminals that are located on the U.S. gulf coast. In addition, we use formed sulfur received through Tampa, Florida ports, which are delivered by truck to our New Wales facility and melted through our sulfur melter. We own and operate a sulfur terminal in Riverview, Florida. We also lease terminal space in Tampa, Florida and Galveston and Beaumont, Texas. We have long-term time charters on two ocean-going tugs/barges and one ocean-going vessel that transports molten sulfur from the Texas terminals to Tampa. We then further transport by truck to our Florida phosphate plants. In addition, we own Gulf Sulphur Services Ltd., LLLP (\u201cGulf Sulphur Services\u201d), which operates a sulfur transportation and terminaling business in the Gulf of Mexico, and handles these functions for a substantial portion of our Florida sulfur volume. Our sulfur logistic assets also include a large fleet of leased railcars that supplement our marine sulfur logistic system. Our Louisiana operations are served by truck from nearby refineries. Although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means, sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been, and may in the future, be the subject of volatile pricing and availability. Alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities. Changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions to sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business. We have included a discussion of sulfur prices in our Management\u2019s Analysis. Ammonia We use ammonia together with P2O5 to produce DAP, MAP and MicroEssentials\u00ae. We consumed approximately 1.0\u00a0million tonnes of ammonia during 2022. Production of one tonne of DAP requires approximately 0.23 tonnes of ammonia. We purchase approximately one-third of our ammonia from various suppliers in the spot market with the remaining two-thirds either purchased through our ammonia supply agreement (the \u201cCF Ammonia Supply Agreement\u201d) with an affiliate of CF Industries Inc. (\u201cCF\u201d) or produced internally at our Faustina, Louisiana location. Our Florida ammonia needs are currently supplied under multi-year contracts with both domestic and offshore producers. Ammonia for our Bartow and Riverview plants is terminaled through owned ammonia facilities at the Port of Tampa and Port Sutton, Florida. Ammonia for our New Wales plant is terminaled through another ammonia facility owned and operated by a third party at Port Sutton, Florida pursuant to an agreement that provides for service through 2022, with automatic renewal for an additional two-year period unless either party terminates, as provided in the agreement. Ammonia is transported by pipeline from the terminals to our production facilities. We have service agreements with the operators of the pipelines for Bartow, New Wales and Riverview, which provide service through June\u00a030, 2023 with annual auto-renewal provisions unless either party objects.  6  6  6 Table of Content Table of Content Under the CF Ammonia Supply Agreement, we purchased 580,000 metric tonnes in 2022. On October 14, 2022, we received notice from CF to exercise the bilateral, contractual right to end the ammonia supply agreement in its current form, effective January 1, 2025. We are confident that we will continue to have adequate sources of supply for ammonia at competitive pricing, including from CF. We expect a majority of the ammonia purchased under the CF Ammonia Supply Agreement to be received by barge at the Port of Tampa and delivered to our Florida facilities as described in the preceding paragraph. We produce ammonia at Faustina, Louisiana primarily for our own consumption. Our annual capacity is approximately 530,000 tonnes. From time to time, we sell surplus ammonia to unrelated parties and/or may transport surplus ammonia to the Port of Tampa. In addition, under certain circumstances we are permitted to receive ammonia at Faustina under the CF Ammonia Supply Agreement. Although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our Phosphate facilities by a variety of means, ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been, and may in the future be, the subject of volatile pricing. In addition, alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities. Changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation or terminaling could have a material impact on our business. We have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our Management\u2019s Analysis. Natural Gas for Phosphates Natural gas is the primary raw material used to manufacture ammonia. At our Faustina facility, ammonia is manufactured on site. The majority of natural gas is purchased through firm delivery contracts based on published index-based prices and is sourced from Texas and Louisiana via pipelines interconnected to the Henry Hub. We use over-the-counter swap and/or option contracts to forward price portions of future natural gas purchases. We typically purchase approximately 11.4\u00a0million MM BTU of natural gas per year for use in ammonia production at Faustina. Our ammonia requirements for our Florida operations are purchased rather than manufactured on site. Therefore, while we typically purchase approximately 2.7 million MM BTU of natural gas per year in Florida, it is only used as a thermal fuel for various phosphate production processes. Florida Land Holdings We are a significant landowner in the State of Florida, which has in the past been considered one of the fastest areas of population growth in the U.S. We own land comprising over 351,000 acres held in fee simple title in central Florida and have the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock reserves. Some of our land holdings are needed to operate our Phosphates business, while a portion of our land assets, such as certain reclaimed properties, are no longer required for our ongoing operations. As a general matter, more of our reclaimed property becomes available for uses other than for phosphate operations each year. Our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants, port facilities, phosphate mines and other property which we have acquired through our presence in Florida. Our long-term future land use strategy is to optimize the value of our land assets. For example, we developed Streamsong Resort\u00ae (the \u201cResort\u201d), a destination resort and conference center, in an area of previously mined land as part of our long-term business strategy to maximize the value and utility of our extensive land holdings in Florida. In addition to a hotel and conference center, the Resort includes multiple golf courses, a clubhouse and ancillary facilities. On January 12, 2023, we completed the sale of the Resort and approximately 7,000 acres of land on which it sits to Lone Windmill LLC, a subsidiary of Kemper Sports Management LLC, for a purchase price of $160 million. See Note 27, Subsequent Events, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.   Potash Segment We are one of the leading potash producers in the world. We mine and process potash in Canada and the U.S. and sell potash in North America and internationally. The term \u201cpotash\u201d applies generally to the common salts of potassium. Muriate of potash (\u201cMOP\u201d) is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry. Red MOP has traces of iron oxide. The granular and standard grade red MOP products are well suited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending. White MOP has a higher percent potassium oxide (\u201cK2O\u201d). White MOP, besides being well suited for the agricultural market, is used in many industrial applications. We also produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product, which we market under our brand name K-Mag\u00ae, at our Carlsbad, New Mexico facility.  7  7  7 Table of Content Table of Content Our potash products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers, distributors and retailers and are also used in the manufacturing of mixed crop nutrients and, to a lesser extent, in animal feed ingredients. We also sell potash to customers for industrial use. In addition, our potash products are used for de-icing and as a water softener regenerant. In 2022, we operated three potash mines in Canada, including two shaft mines and one solution mine, as well as one potash shaft mine in the U.S.. In 2022, the decommissioning of the K1 and K2 shafts at our Esterhazy, Saskatchewan mine was completed after their shutdown in the second quarter of 2021.  Capacity and production from these shafts was replaced by the K3 expansion. In the third quarter of 2021, we restarted the Colonsay, Saskatchewan mine to meet market demand for potash.   Mosaic leases approximately 291,500 acres of mineral rights from the government of Saskatchewan, and approximately 99,700 acres of freehold mineral rights in the Kronau/Regina area, which have not been developed.  We pay Canadian resource taxes consisting of the Potash Production Tax and resource surcharge. The Potash Production Tax is a Saskatchewan provincial tax on potash production and consists of a base payment and a profits tax. We also pay a percentage of the value of resource sales from our Saskatchewan mines. In addition to the Canadian resource taxes, royalties are payable to the mineral owners in respect of potash reserves or production of potash. We have included a further discussion of the Canadian resource taxes and royalties in our Management\u2019s Analysis.                        8  8  8 Table of Content Table of Content The map below shows the location of each of our potash properties:  Our North American potash annualized operational capacity totals 11.2 million tonnes of product per year and accounts for approximately 14% of world annual capacity and 34% of North American annual capacity. Production during 2022 totaled 9.0 million tonnes. We account for approximately 14% of estimated world annual production and 35% of estimated North American annual production.  9  9  9 Table of Content Table of Content The following table shows, for each of our potash mines, annual capacity as of December\u00a031, 2022 and finished product output for 2022:(tonnes in millions)\u00a0\u00a0FacilityAnnualizedProvenPeakingCapacity(a)(c)(d)AnnualOperationalCapacity(a)(b)(d)(e)FinishedProduct(b)CanadaBelle Plaine\u2014MOP3.9\u00a03.0\u00a02.8\u00a0Colonsay\u2014MOP (f)2.6\u00a01.5\u00a00.9\u00a0Esterhazy\u2014MOP(g)6.3\u00a06.0\u00a04.7\u00a0Canadian Total12.8\u00a010.5\u00a08.4\u00a0United StatesCarlsbad\u2014K-Mag\u00ae(h)0.9\u00a00.7\u00a00.6\u00a0United States Total0.9\u00a00.7\u00a00.6\u00a0Totals13.7\u00a011.2\u00a09.0\u00a0 Annualized Proven Peaking Capacity (a)(c)(d) Annual Operational Capacity (a)(b)(d)(e) Finished Product(b) Colonsay\u2014MOP (f) Esterhazy\u2014MOP(g) Carlsbad\u2014K-Mag\u00ae(h) ______________________________ (a)Finished product. (b)Actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the above table due to factors that include, among others, the level of demand for our products, maintenance and turnaround time, the quality of the reserves and the nature of the geologic formations we are mining at any particular time, accidents, mechanical failure, product mix, and other operating conditions. (c)Represents full capacity assuming no turnaround or maintenance time. (d)The annualized proven peaking capacity shown above is the capacity currently used to determine our share of Canpotex, Limited (\u201cCanpotex\u201d) sales. Canpotex members\u2019 respective shares of Canpotex sales are based upon the members\u2019 respective proven peaking capacities for producing potash. When a Canpotex member expands its production capacity, the new capacity is added to that member\u2019s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level. Alternatively, Canpotex members may elect to rely on an independent engineering firm and approved protocols to calculate their proven peaking capacity. The annual operational capacity reported in the table above can exceed the annualized proven peaking capacity until the proving run has been completed. Our entitlement percentage of Canpotex is 36.2%.  (e)Annual operational capacity is our estimated long-term potash capacity based on the quality of reserves and the nature of the geologic formations expected to be mined, milled and/or processed over the long term, average amount of scheduled down time, including maintenance and scheduled turnaround time, and product mix, and no significant modifications to operating conditions, equipment or facilities. Operational capacities will continue to be updated to the extent new production results impact ore grades assumptions. (f)We have the ability to reach an annual operating capacity of 2.1 million tonnes over time by increasing our staffing levels and investment in mine development activities. Our Colonsay mine operates as a swing mine to meet market demands. (g)In June, 2021, we permanently ceased operations at the K1 and K2 mine shafts. The annual operational capacity of Esterhazy has remained consistent following the K1 and K2 closures as capacity from the K3 mine shafts has replaced K1 and K2. (h)K-Mag\u00ae is a specialty product that we produce at our Carlsbad facility.  See Item 2, \u201cProperties\u201d for a discussion of our potash mining properties, including processing methods, facilities, production and summaries of our mineral resources and reserves, both in the aggregate and for our individual material potash mining properties. Natural Gas Natural gas is used at our Belle Plaine solution mine as a fuel to produce steam and to dry potash products. The steam is used to generate electricity and provide thermal energy to the evaporation, crystallization and solution mining processes. The Belle Plaine solution mine typically accounts for approximately 80% of our Potash segment\u2019s total natural gas requirements for potash production. At our shaft mines, natural gas is used as a fuel to heat fresh air supplied to the shaft mines and for drying potash products. Combined natural gas usage for both the solution and shaft mines totaled 17.7\u00a0million MM BTU during 2022. We purchase our natural gas requirements on firm delivery index price-based physical contracts and on short-term spot-priced physical contracts. Our Canadian operations purchase physical natural gas from companies in Alberta and Saskatchewan using AECO price indices references and transport the gas to our plants via the TransGas pipeline system. The U.S. potash operation in New Mexico purchases physical gas in the southwest respective regional market using the El Paso   10  10  10 Table of Content Table of Content San Juan Basin market pricing reference. We use financial derivative contracts to manage the pricing on portions of our natural gas requirements.  Mosaic Fertilizantes Segment Our Mosaic Fertilizantes segment owns and operates mines, chemical plants, crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities, port terminals and warehouses in Brazil and Paraguay, which produce and sell concentrated phosphates crop nutrients, phosphate-based animal feed ingredients and potash fertilizer. The following map shows the locations of our operations in Brazil and Paraguay:  We are the largest producer and one of the largest distributors of blended crop nutrients for agricultural use in Brazil. We produce and sell phosphate- and potash-based crop nutrients, and animal feed ingredients through our operations. Our operations in Brazil include five phosphate mines, four chemical plants and a potash mine. We own and operate ten blending plants in Brazil and one blending plant and port in Paraguay. In addition, we lease several other warehouses and blending units depending on sales and production levels. We also have a 62% ownership interest in Fospar, S.A. (\u201cFospar\u201d). Fospar owns and operates an SSP (defined below) granulation plant, which produces approximately 0.5 million tonnes of SSP per year, and a deep-water port and throughput warehouse terminal facility in Paranagua, Brazil. The port facility at Paranagua handles approximately 3.6\u00a0million tonnes of imported crop nutrients. In 2022, Mosaic Fertilizantes sold approximately 9.4 million tonnes of crop nutrient products and accounted for approximately 22% of fertilizer shipments in Brazil. We have the capability to annually produce approximately 4.5 million tonnes of phosphate- and potash-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients. Crop nutrient products produced are marketed to crop nutrient manufacturers, distributors, retailers and farmers.  11  11  11 Table of Content Table of Content In addition to producing crop nutrients, Mosaic Fertilizantes purchases phosphates, potash and nitrogen products which are either used to produce blended crop nutrients (\u201cBlends\u201d) or for resale. In 2022, Mosaic Fertilizantes purchased 1.5 million tonnes of phosphate-based products, primarily MicroEssentials\u00ae, from our Phosphates segment, and 2.3 million tonnes of potash products from our Potash segment and Canpotex. Phosphate Crop Nutrients and Animal Feed Ingredients Our Brazilian phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 1.1 million tonnes of P2O5 per year, or about 70% of Brazilian annual capacity. Phosphoric acid is produced by reacting ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. P2O5 is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry. Our Brazilian P2O5 production totaled approximately 1.0 million tonnes in 2022 and accounted for approximately 99% of Brazilian annual output. Our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are: \u2022Monoammonium Phosphate (11-52-0) (\u201cMAP\u201d):  MAP is a crop nutrient composed of two macronutrients, nitrogen and phosphoric acid. This slurry is added inside a rotary drum type granulator with ammonia to complete the neutralization reaction and produce MAP. \u2022Triple superphosphate (\u201cTSP\u201d):  TSP is a highly concentrated phosphate crop nutrient. TSP is produced from the phosphate rock reaction with phosphoric acid in a kuhlmann type reactor. The process for the production of TSP in Brazil is run of pile where the product undergoes a curing process of approximately seven days for later granulation. \u2022Single superphosphate (\u201cSSP\u201d):  SSP is a crop nutrient with a low concentration of phosphorus that is used in agriculture because of the sulfur content in its formulation. SSP is produced from mixing phosphate rock with sulfuric acid in a kuhlmann or malaxador type reactor. After the reaction, the product goes to the curing process and then feeds the granulation units. \u2022Dicalcium phosphate (\u201cDCP\u201d):  Dicalcium phosphate is produced by the reaction of desulphurized phosphoric acid with limestone. At Uberaba, it is produced from the reaction of concentrated phosphoric acid with limestone slurry. At Cajati the phosphoric acid is diluted with dry limestone. The reaction of the DCP occurs in a kuhlmann or spinden type reactor. Our primary mines and chemical plants are located in the states of Minas Gerais, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Goias. Production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our Uberaba, Minas Gerais and Cajati, S\u00e3o Paulo facilities. We market our feed phosphate primarily under the brand name Fosc\u00e1lcio.

Factors affecting actual production are described in note (c) below. (b)The annual production capacity was calculated using the hourly capacity, days stopped for annual maintenance and OEE (historical utilization factor and capacity factor). (c)Actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the table above due to factors that include, among others, the level of demand for our products, maintenance and turnaround time, accidents and mechanical failure.  12  12  12 Table of Content Table of Content The phosphoric acid produced at Cajati is used to produce DCP. The phosphoric acid produced at Uberaba is used to produce MAP, TSP and DCP. We produced approximately 2.8\u00a0million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2022 which accounted for approximately 49% of estimated Brazilian annual production. Phosphate Rock Phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed product. Our phosphate rock production in Brazil totaled approximately 4.0\u00a0million tonnes in 2022, which accounted for approximately 79% of estimated Brazilian annual production. We are the largest producer of phosphate rock in Brazil and currently operate five properties with a combined annual capacity of approximately 4.6 million tonnes. Production of one tonne of MAP requires 1.6 to 1.7 tonnes of phosphate rock. Production of one tonne of SSP requires between 0.6 to 0.7 tonnes of phosphate rock. Production of one tonne of TSP requires 1.4 tonnes of phosphate rock. During 2022, we operated five properties; Arax\u00e1, Patroc\u00ednio and Tapira, in the state of Minas Gerais; Catal\u00e3o, in the state of Goi\u00e1s; and Cajati, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. See Item 2, \u201cProperties\u201d for a discussion of our Brazilian mining properties, including processing methods, facilities, production and summaries of our mineral resources and reserves, both in the aggregate and for our individually material Brazilian properties. We are required to pay royalties to mineral owners and resource taxes to the Brazilian government for phosphate and potash production. The resource taxes, known as Compensa\u00e7\u00e3o Financeira pela Explora\u00e7\u00e3o de Recursos Minerais or CFEM, are regulated by the National Mining Agency. In 2022, we paid royalties and resource taxes of approximately $18.0 million. Sulfur We use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid, one of the key components used in the production of phosphoric acid. We consumed approximately 1.2 million long tons of sulfur for our own production during 2022. We purchase approximately 13% of the volume under annual supply agreements from oil and natural gas refiners, who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process. The remaining 87% is purchased in the spot market. Sulfur is imported through the Tiplam port and transported by rail to the Uberaba plant and by truck to the Arax\u00e1 and Cajati locations. Although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means, sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been, and could in the future be, subject to volatile pricing and availability. Alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities. Changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions to sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business. Ammonia We use ammonia, together with phosphoric acid, to produce MAP, and to a lesser extent for SSP production. We consumed approximately 137,495 tonnes of ammonia during 2022. Production of one tonne of MAP requires approximately 0.137 tonnes of ammonia. We purchase all of our ammonia under a long-term supply agreement with two suppliers. Ammonia is imported through the Tiplam port and transported by truck to Uberaba, Arax\u00e1 and Catal\u00e3o. We own approximately 1% of the Tiplam terminal in Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo. Our ownership percentage, along with a contractual agreement, guarantee us unloading priority for ammonia and also provide us unloading capacity for rock, sulfur and crop nutrients. Although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means, ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been, and in the future could be, subject to volatile pricing. Alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities. Changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation or terminaling could have a material impact on our business.   13  13  13 Table of Content Table of Content Brazilian Potash We conduct potash operations through the leased Taquari-Vassouras shaft mine, which is the only potash mine in Brazil, located in Ros\u00e1rio do Catete in the Brazilian state of Sergipe. We also own a related refinery at the site. We produce and sell potash product domestically. MOP is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry in Brazil. Red MOP has traces of iron oxide. The granular and standard grade red MOP products are well-suited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending. Our potash product is marketed in Brazil to crop nutrient manufacturers, distributors and retailers and is also used in the manufacturing of crop nutrients. In 2022, we paid royalties of approximately $11.4 million related to the leasing of potash assets and mining rights for Taquari. Land Holdings Mosaic Fertilizantes owns the surface rights of certain rural lands comprising over 34,000 hectares (84,000 acres) in the States of S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais, Goi\u00e1s, Paran\u00e1, Mato Grosso, Santa Catarina, Bahia and Sergipe, and has the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock or potash reserves. Most of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphate and potash production and fertilizer distribution businesses. A portion of our land assets may no longer be required for our current operations and may be leased to third parties, for agricultural or other purposes, or may be set aside for mineral or environmental conservation. Our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants, port facilities and phosphate and potash mines, crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities and other properties which we have acquired through our presence in Brazil.  India and China Distribution Businesses Our China and India distribution businesses market phosphate-, potash- and nitrogen-based crop nutrients and provide other ancillary services to wholesalers, cooperatives, independent retailers, and farmers in the Asia-Pacific regions. These operations provide our Phosphates and Potash segments access to key markets outside of North and South America and serve as a marketing agent for our Phosphates segment. In 2022, the India and China operations purchased 523,110 tonnes of phosphate-based products from our Phosphates segment and MWSPC, and 1,344,926 tonnes of potash products from our Potash segment and Canpotex. They also purchase phosphates, potash and nitrogen products from unrelated third parties, which we either use to produce blended crop nutrients or for resale. In China, we own two 300,000-tonne per year capacity blending plants. In 2022, we sold approximately 230,000 tonnes of Blends and distributed another 825,000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrients in China. In India, we have distribution facilities to import and sell crop nutrients. In 2022, we distributed approximately 535,000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrient products in India.  SALES AND DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES United States and Canada We have a U.S. and Canada sales and marketing team that serves our business segments. We sell to wholesale distributors, retail chains, cooperatives, independent retailers and national accounts. Customer service and the ability to effectively minimize the overall supply chain costs are key competitive factors in the crop nutrient and animal feed ingredients businesses. In addition to our production facilities, to service the needs of our customers, we own or have contractual throughput or other arrangements at strategically located distribution warehouses along or near the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, as well as in other key agricultural regions of the U.S. and Canada. From these facilities, we distribute Mosaic-produced phosphate and potash products for customers who in turn resell the product into the distribution channel or directly to farmers in the U.S. and Canada. We own port facilities in Tampa, Florida which have deep water berth capabilities providing access to the Gulf of Mexico. We also own warehouse distribution facilities in: Rosemount, Minnesota; Pekin, Illinois; and Henderson, Kentucky. In 2022, we sold our warehouse facility in Savage, Minnesota.  14  14  14 Table of Content Table of Content In addition to the facilities that we own, our U.S. distribution operations also include leased distribution space or contractual throughput agreements in other key geographical areas including California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin. Our Canadian customers include independent dealers and national accounts. We also lease or own warehouse facilities in Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba in Canada. International Outside of the U.S. and Canada, we market our Phosphates segment\u2019s products through our Mosaic Fertilizantes segment and our China and India distribution businesses, as well as a salesforce focused on geographies outside of North America. The countries that account for the largest amount of our phosphates sales outside the U.S., by volume, are Brazil, Canada, Argentina and Mexico. Our sales of potash products outside of the U.S. and Canada are made through Canpotex. Canpotex sales are allocated among its members based on peaking capacity. In 2022, our entitlement percentage of Canpotex was 36.2%. Our potash exports from Carlsbad are sold through our own sales force. We also market our Potash segment\u2019s products through our Mosaic Fertilizantes segment and our China and India distribution businesses, which acquire potash primarily through Canpotex. The countries that account for the largest amount of international potash sales, by volume, are Brazil, China, Indonesia, India and Malaysia. To service the needs of our customers, our Mosaic Fertilizantes segment includes a network of strategically located sales offices, crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities, port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities that we own and operate. The blending and bagging facilities primarily produce Blends from phosphate, potash and nitrogen. The average product mix in our Blends (by volume) contains approximately 24% nitrogen, 51% phosphate and 25% potash, although this mix differs based on seasonal and other factors. All of our production in Brazil is consumed within the country. Our India and China distribution businesses also includes a network of strategically located sales offices, crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities, port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities. These businesses serve primarily as a sales outlet for our North American phosphates production, as well as additional phosphate production we market from our MWSPC joint venture, both for resale and as an input for Blends. Our Potash segment also has historically furnished the majority of the raw materials needs for the production of Blends, primarily via Canpotex, and is expected to continue to do so in the future. Other Products With a strong brand position in a multi-billion dollar animal feed ingredients global market, our Phosphates segment supplies animal feed ingredients for poultry and livestock to customers in North America, Latin America and Asia. Our potash sales to non-agricultural users are primarily to large industrial accounts and the animal feed industry. Additionally, in North America, we sell potash for de-icing and as a water softener regenerant. In Brazil, we also sell phosphogypsum.   COMPETITION Because crop nutrients are global commodities available from numerous sources, crop nutrition companies compete primarily on the basis of delivered price. Other competitive factors include product quality, cost and availability of raw materials, customer service, plant efficiency and availability of product. As a result, markets for our products are highly competitive. We compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers, including farmer cooperatives, subsidiaries of larger companies, and independent crop nutrient companies. Foreign competitors may have access to less expensive raw materials, may not have to comply with as stringent regulatory requirements or are owned or subsidized by governments and, as a result, may have cost advantages over North American companies. We believe that our extensive North American and international production and distribution system provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale, transportation and storage efficiencies, and obtain market intelligence. Also, we believe our performance products, such as MicroEssentials\u00ae, provide us a competitive advantage with customers in North and South America. Unlike many of our competitors, we have our own distribution system to sell phosphate- and potash-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients, whether produced by us or by other third parties, around the globe. In North America, we have one of the largest and most strategically located distribution systems for crop nutrients, including warehouse facilities in key   15  15  15 Table of Content Table of Content agricultural regions. We also have an extensive network of distribution facilities internationally, including in the key growth regions of South America and Asia, with port terminals, warehouses, and blending plants in Brazil, Paraguay, China, and India. Our global presence allows us to efficiently serve customers in approximately 40 countries. Phosphates Segment Our Phosphates segment operates in a highly competitive global market. Among the competitors in the global phosphate industry are domestic and foreign companies, as well as foreign government-supported producers in Asia and North Africa. Phosphate producers compete primarily based on price, as well as product quality, service and innovation. Major integrated producers of feed phosphates are located in the U.S., Europe and China. Many smaller producers are located in emerging markets around the world. Many of these smaller producers are not miners of phosphate rock or manufacturers of phosphoric acid and are required to purchase this material on the open market. We believe that we are a low-cost integrated producer of phosphate-based crop nutrients, due in part to our scale, vertical integration and strategic network of production and distribution facilities. As the world\u2019s second largest producer of concentrated phosphates, as well as the second largest miner of phosphate rock in the world and the largest in the U.S., we maintain an advantage over some competitors as the scale of operations effectively reduces production costs per unit. We are also vertically integrated to captively supply one of our key inputs, phosphate rock, to our phosphate production facilities. We believe that our position as an integrated producer of phosphate rock provides us with a significant cost advantage over competitors that are non-integrated phosphate producers. In addition, our ownership in the Miski Mayo Mine allows us to supplement our overall phosphate rock needs. We also sell approximately 25% of Miski Mayo Mine production to third parties. MWSPC enables us to not only further diversify our sources of phosphates but also improve our access to key agricultural countries in Asia and the Middle East. We produce ammonia at our Faustina, Louisiana concentrates plant in quantities sufficient to meet approximately one third of our total ammonia needs in North America. We do not have ammonia production capacity within Florida to serve our Florida operations, but we have capacity to supply a portion of our requirements by transporting produced ammonia from Louisiana to Florida. We purchase additional ammonia from world markets and thus are subject to significant volatility in our purchase price of ammonia. The CF Ammonia Supply Agreement provides us with a supply of a substantial volume of ammonia at prices based on the price of natural gas. With our dedicated sulfur transportation barges and tugs, and our ownership interest in Gulf Sulphur Services, we are also well-positioned to source an adequate, flexible and cost-effective supply of sulfur, our third key input, to our Florida and Louisiana phosphate production facilities. We believe that our investments in sulfur logistical and melting assets continue to afford us a competitive advantage compared to other producers in cost and access to sulfur. With facilities in both central Florida and Louisiana, we are logistically well positioned to fulfill our material needs at very competitive prices. Those multiple production points also afford us the flexibility to optimally balance supply and demand. Potash Segment Potash is a commodity available from several geographical regions around the world and, consequently, the market is highly competitive. Through our participation in Canpotex, we compete outside of North America against various independent and state-owned potash producers. Canpotex has substantial expertise and logistical resources for the international distribution of potash, including strategically located export assets in Portland, Oregon, St. John, New Brunswick and Vancouver, British Columbia. Our principal methods of competition with respect to the sale of potash include product pricing and offering consistent, high-quality products and superior service. We believe that our potash cost structure is competitive in the industry and should improve as we continue to complete our potash expansion projects. Mosaic Fertilizantes The Mosaic Fertilizantes segment operates in a highly competitive market in Brazil. We compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers, including farmer cooperatives, subsidiaries of larger companies, and independent crop nutrient companies. We believe that having a vertically integrated business, internationally but also in Brazil, provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale, transportation and storage efficiencies, and obtain market intelligence.  16  16  16 Table of Content Table of Content Mosaic Fertilizantes has a wide variety of customers including farmers, blenders, and other local distributors. We compete with local businesses that offer a wide variety of products that are available from many sources. We believe the strategic location of our mines and chemical plants, in close proximity to our customers, and the benefit of our own distribution network, gives us an advantage over most of our competitors. The vertical integration of our wholly-owned production, along with our distribution network, as well as our focus on product innovation and customer solutions, position us with an advantage over many of our competitors. We have a strong brand in Brazil. In addition to having access to our own production, our distribution activities have the capability to supply a wide variety of crop nutrients to our dealer and farmer customer base.  FACTORS AFFECTING DEMAND Our results of operations historically have reflected the effects of several external factors which are beyond our control and have in the past produced significant downward and upward swings in operating results. Revenues are highly dependent upon conditions in the agriculture industry and can be affected by, among other factors: crop conditions; changes in agricultural production practices; worldwide economic conditions, including the increasing world population, household incomes, and demand for more protein-rich food, particularly in developing regions such as China, India and Latin America; changing demand for biofuels; variability in commodity pricing; governmental policies; the level of inventories in the crop nutrient distribution channels; customer expectations regarding farmer economics, future crop nutrient prices and availability, and transportation costs, among other matters; market trends in raw material costs; market prices for crop nutrients; and weather. Furthermore, our crop nutrients business is seasonal to the extent farmers and agricultural enterprises in the markets in which we compete purchase more crop nutrient products during the spring and fall. The international scope of our business, spanning the northern and southern hemispheres, reduces to some extent the seasonal impact on our business. The degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors. The seasonal nature of our businesses requires significant working capital for inventory in advance of the planting seasons. We sell products throughout the world. Unfavorable changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, government policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade; unexpected changes in tax and trade treaties; and strengthening or weakening of foreign economies as well as political relations with the U.S. may cause sales trends to customers in one or more foreign countries to differ from sales trends in the U.S. Our international operations are subject to risks from changes in foreign currencies, or government policy, which can affect local farmer economics.  OTHER MATTERS Employees We had 13,570 employees as of December\u00a031, 2022, consisting of approximately 9,868 salaried and 3,702 hourly employees. There are also approximately 198 salaried and 493 hourly employees at the Miski Mayo Mine, of which we own 75% and its results are consolidated within our results of operations. Labor Relations As of December\u00a031, 2022: \u2022We had ten collective bargaining agreements with unions covering certain hourly employees in the U.S. and Canada. Of these employees, approximately 5% are covered under agreements that expire in 2023. All are expected to collectively bargain for new contracts in 2023. \u2022We had agreements with 35 unions covering all employees in Brazil. More than one agreement may govern our relations with each of these unions. In general, the agreements are renewable on an annual basis. Failure to renew any of our union agreements could result in a strike or labor stoppage that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. However, we have not experienced a significant work stoppage in many years and historically have had good labor relations.  17  17  17 Table of Content Table of Content Information Available on our Website Our Annual Report Form on 10-K (\u201cForm 10-K\u201d), Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (\u201cForm 10-Q\u201d), Current Reports on Form 8-K (\u201cForm 8-K\u201d), and amendments thereto, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) pursuant to Section\u00a013(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder are made available free of charge on our website (www.mosaicco.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

We announced global 2030 diversity goals and are driving accountability into the business units by establishing business-level initiatives and programs to address opportunities to progress toward the goals. We also established our first executive-led Employee Inclusion Networks to create community and allyship, develop awareness and enhance workforce engagement.   \u2022In 2022, Mosaic continued to evolve and build upon foundational learning by driving conscious inclusion education deeper into the organization and providing an enhanced, self-directed learning platform to our leaders. We refocused our recruitment efforts on creating a more diverse talent pipeline, partnering with a U.S.-based public historically black college to create an immersive internship program; and identifying additional opportunities to attract and retain diverse talent.  Additional information about our human capital, including our diversity and inclusion goals for 2030, is available in the sustainability report posted on our website. The information contained on our website is not being incorporated in this report.  \u2022Pay equity is fundamental to our compensation philosophy and our commitment to diversity and inclusion. Mosaic annually evaluates pay equity and compensation practices to ensure fair and equitable treatment of employees based on our pay-for-performance framework. In 2022, Mosaic retained an independent consultant to assist with our pay equity analysis across our global operations and to help us enhance our internal capabilities to annually assess pay disparities. The results revealed 19 outliers without adequate business justifications. Mosaic intends to address each of the instances during our 2023 compensation cycle. Pay equity will be reviewed internally every year and we expect to conduct external independent reviews every three years.  19  19  19  Table of Content Table of Content INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS  Information regarding our executive officers as of February\u00a023, 2023 is set forth below: NameAgePositionPhilip E.
