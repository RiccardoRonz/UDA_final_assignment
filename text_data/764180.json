General Development of Business When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cForm 10-K\u201d), the terms \u201cAltria,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to either (i) Altria Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries or (ii) Altria Group, Inc. only and not its consolidated subsidiaries, as appropriate in the context. We have a leading portfolio of tobacco products for U.S. tobacco consumers age 21+.  Our Vision by 2030 is to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future (\u201cVision\u201d).  We are Moving Beyond SmokingTM, leading the way in moving adult smokers away from cigarettes by taking action to transition millions to potentially less harmful choices - believing it is a substantial opportunity for adult tobacco consumers, our businesses and society. Our wholly owned subsidiaries include Philip Morris USA Inc. (\u201cPM USA\u201d), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; John Middleton Co. (\u201cMiddleton\u201d), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly owned subsidiary of PM USA; UST LLC (\u201cUST\u201d), which, through its wholly owned subsidiary U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC (\u201cUSSTC\u201d), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of moist smokeless tobacco products (\u201cMST\u201d) and snus products; and Helix Innovations LLC (\u201cHelix\u201d), which operates in the United States and Canada, and Helix Innovations GmbH and its affiliates (\u201cHelix ROW\u201d), which operate internationally in the rest-of-world, are engaged in the manufacture and sale of oral nicotine pouches.  Other wholly owned subsidiaries include Altria Group Distribution Company, which provides sales and distribution services to our domestic tobacco operating companies; Altria Client Services LLC (\u201cALCS\u201d), which provides various support services to our companies in areas such as legal, regulatory, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs; and Philip Morris Capital Corporation (\u201cPMCC\u201d), which completed the wind-down of its portfolio of finance assets in 2022 and had no finance assets remaining at December 31, 2022. In October 2022, Altria, through PM USA, entered into a joint venture with JTI (US) Holding, Inc. (\u201cJTIUH\u201d), a subsidiary of Japan Tobacco Inc. (\u201cJapan Tobacco\u201d), for the U.S. marketing and commercialization of heated tobacco stick (\u201cHTS\u201d) products.  The joint venture entity, Horizon Innovations LLC (\u201cHorizon\u201d), is structured to exist in perpetuity and is responsible for the U.S. commercialization of HTS products owned by either party.  PM USA holds a 75% economic interest in Horizon with JTIUH having a 25% economic interest.  The parties plan to collaborate on a global smoke-free partnership.  Horizon is governed by a board of managers, which is comprised of four individuals designated by PM USA and three individuals designated by JTIUH.  For further information, see Other Tobacco Products below. In October 2021, UST sold its subsidiary, International Wine & Spirits Ltd. (\u201cIWS\u201d), which included Ste.

Michelle\u201d), in an all-cash transaction with a net purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion and the assumption of certain liabilities of IWS and its subsidiaries (the \u201cSte. Michelle Transaction\u201d). In December 2020 and April 2021, we purchased the remaining 20% interest in (i) Helix ROW and (ii) Helix, respectively.  The total purchase price of the December 2020 and April 2021 transactions was approximately $250 million. Our reportable segments are smokeable products and oral tobacco products.  The financial services business, the IQOS System (as defined below) heated tobacco business and Helix ROW are included in an all other category due to the relative financial contribution of these businesses to our consolidated results.  Prior to the Ste. Michelle Transaction, wine produced and/or sold by Ste. Michelle was a reportable segment.  For further information, see Note 14. Segment Reporting to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K (\u201cItem 8\u201d).

We account for our investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag.  We account for our investment in JUUL at fair value. For further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 5. Investments in Equity Securities to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (\u201cNote 5\u201d). Description of Business Portions of the information relating to this Item are included in Operating Results by Business Segment in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K (\u201cItem 7\u201d). Tobacco Space Our tobacco operating companies include PM USA, USSTC and other subsidiaries of UST, Middleton and Helix. The products of our tobacco operating companies include: (i) smokeable tobacco products, consisting of combustible cigarettes manufactured and sold by PM USA and machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco manufactured and sold by Middleton; and (ii) oral  1 1  1 Table of Contents Table of Contents tobacco products, consisting of MST and snus products manufactured and sold by USSTC and oral nicotine pouches manufactured and sold by Helix. \u25aaCigarettes: PM USA is the largest cigarette company in the United States and substantially all cigarettes are manufactured and sold to customers in the United States.  Marlboro, the principal cigarette brand of PM USA, has been the largest-selling cigarette brand in the United States for over 45 years.  Total smokeable products segment\u2019s cigarettes shipment volume in the United States was 84.7 billion units in 2022, a decrease of 9.7% from 2021. \u25aaCigars: Middleton is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco.  Middleton contracts with a third-party importer to supply a majority of its cigars and sells substantially all of its cigars to customers in the United States.  Black & Mild is the principal cigar brand of Middleton.  Total smokeable products segment\u2019s cigars shipment volume was approximately 1.7 billion units in 2022, a decrease of 4.0% from 2021. \u25aaOral tobacco products: USSTC is the leading producer and marketer of MST products.  The oral tobacco products segment includes the premium brands, Copenhagen and Skoal, and a value brand, Red Seal, sold by USSTC.  In addition, the oral tobacco products segment includes on! oral nicotine pouches sold by Helix.  Substantially all of the oral tobacco products are manufactured and sold to customers in the United States.  Total oral tobacco products segment\u2019s shipment volume was 800.6 million units in 2022, a decrease of 2.4% from 2021. \u25aaOther tobacco products: In December 2013, we entered into a series of agreements with Philip Morris International Inc. (\u201cPMI\u201d), including an agreement that granted us an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI\u2019s heated tobacco products in the United States.  In 2019, PM USA began commercialization of PMI\u2019s IQOS Tobacco Heating System (\u201cIQOS System\u201d) in select markets. In connection with a patent dispute, the U.S. International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d) issued a limited exclusion order barring the importation of the IQOS System electronic device, Marlboro HeatSticks and the infringing components into the United States and a cease and desist order barring domestic sales, marketing and distribution of these imported products effective November 29, 2021.  Due to this litigation, we removed the IQOS System electronic device and Marlboro HeatSticks from the marketplace.  For a further discussion of the ITC decision, see Note 17. Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (\u201cNote 17\u201d). In October 2022, we entered into an agreement with PMI to, among other things, transition and ultimately conclude our relationship with respect to the IQOS System in the United States.  We have agreed to assign to PMI exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to the IQOS System effective April 30, 2024.  PMI will not have access to the Marlboro brand name or other brand assets, as PM USA owns the Marlboro trademark in the United States.  For further discussion see Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (\u201cNote 4\u201d). In connection with the joint venture agreement with JTIUH, Horizon will market and commercialize HTS products, which are defined in the joint venture agreement as products that include both (i) a tobacco heating device intended to heat the consumable without combusting and (ii) a consumable that meets the definition of a cigarette under the U.S. Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.  Horizon is responsible for the U.S. commercialization of current and future HTS products owned by either party and, upon authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) of a pre-market tobacco application (\u201cPMTA\u201d), will become the exclusive entity through which the parties market and commercialize HTS products in the United States.  Upon PMTA authorization of Ploom HTS products, JTIUH will supply Ploom HTS devices and PM USA will manufacture Marlboro HTS consumables for U.S. commercialization. \u25aaDistribution, Competition and Raw Materials: Our tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers (including distributors) and large retail organizations, including chain stores. The market for tobacco products is highly competitive, characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition.  Promotional activities include, in certain instances and where permitted by law, allowances, the distribution of incentive items, price promotions, product promotions, coupons and other discounts. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (\u201cFSPTCA\u201d) provides the FDA with broad authority to regulate the design, manufacture, packaging, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products; the authority to require disclosures of related information; and the authority to enforce the FSPTCA and related regulations. In the United States, under a contract growing program, PM USA purchases the majority of its burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos directly from domestic tobacco growers.  Under the terms of this program, PM USA agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts that meets PM USA\u2019s grade and quality standards.  PM USA also purchases a portion of its tobacco requirements through leaf merchants. USSTC purchases dark fire-cured, dark air-cured and burley leaf tobaccos from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program.  Under the terms of this program, USSTC agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts that meets USSTC\u2019s grade and quality standards. 2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents Middleton purchases burley, dark air-cured and flue-cured leaf tobaccos through leaf merchants.  Middleton does not have a contract growing program. Helix, through an affiliate, purchases tobacco-derived nicotine materials from suppliers and believes its suppliers can satisfy current and anticipated future production requirements. Our tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements. For further discussion of the foregoing matters, the tobacco business environment, trends in market demand and competitive conditions, and related risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K (\u201cItem 1A\u201d) and Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7. Other Matters \u25aaCustomers: For a discussion of PM USA, USSTC, Helix and Middleton\u2019s largest customers, including their percentages of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December\u00a031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 14. Segment Reporting to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (\u201cNote 14\u201d). \u25aaExecutive Officers of Altria: The disclosure regarding executive officers is included in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance - Information about Our Executive Officers as of February 15, 2023 of this Form 10-K. \u25aaHuman Capital Resources: We believe our workforce is critical to achieving our Vision.  Attracting, developing, deploying and retaining the best talent with the skills to make significant progress toward our Vision is a key business priority.  Moreover, we recognize the importance of doing business the right way.  We believe culture influences employee actions and decision-making.  This is why we dedicate resources to promoting a vibrant, inclusive workplace; attracting, developing and retaining talented, diverse employees; promoting a culture of compliance and integrity; creating a safe workplace; and rewarding and recognizing employees for both the results they deliver and, importantly, how they deliver them. Oversight and Management Our Human Resources department is responsible for managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding, compensation and benefits design and implementation, performance management, career management and succession planning and professional and learning development.  Our inclusion, diversity and equity (\u201cID&E\u201d) programs are managed by our Corporate Citizenship department.  Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard of Directors\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) and the Compensation and Talent Development Committee provide oversight of human capital matters, including reviewing initiatives and programs related to corporate culture and enterprise-wide talent development, including our ID&E initiatives. Inclusion, Diversity and Equity We recognize the critical importance of ID&E in pursuing our Vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures.  In 2020, we established the following aspirational Inclusion & Diversity Aiming Points to help guide our efforts: \u25aaBe an inclusive place to work for all employees, regardless of level, demographic group or work function. \u25aaHave equal numbers of men and women among our vice president and director-level employees. \u25aaIncrease our vice president and director-level employees who are Asian, Black, Hispanic or two or more races to at least 30%. \u25aaIncrease our vice president and director-level employees who are LGBTQ+, a person with a disability or a veteran. \u25aaHave diverse functional leadership teams that reflect the organizations they lead. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 34% of vice president-level and 41% of director-level roles; Asian, Black, Hispanic or employees of two or more races represented 21% of our vice president-level and 26% of our director-level roles. Compensation and Benefits Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract, retain and motivate strong talent.  However, we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent.  We work to manage this risk by, among other things, targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies with which we compete for talent.  Depending on employee level, total compensation includes different elements \u2013 base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity and cash incentives and benefits.  We design our compensation program to deliver total compensation at levels between the 50th and 75th percentiles of compensation paid to employees in comparable positions at our peer companies.  Actual total compensation can exceed the 75th percentile or be below the 50th percentile depending on business and individual performance. We are committed to pay equity across our companies.  Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in December 2022, adjusting for factors generally considered to be legitimate differentiators of salary, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 99.6% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our non-white employees were 100% of those of our white employees. 3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents In addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plan coverage, vacation and holiday pay, disability and life insurance, and up to 12 weeks paid parental and family leave for birth, adoption and foster placement and an additional six weeks paid leave for birth mothers.  Our benefits also include physical, emotional and financial wellness programs and family creation assistance benefits, such as adoption assistance and coverage for fertility treatments.  While there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies, the examples we provide are available to most employees. We are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through an unlimited tuition refund program for job-related courses or company-related degrees.  We also provide eligible employees with a company-funded contribution applied to the employee\u2019s qualified higher education student loans to help reduce student loan debt. Attracting, Developing and Retaining Talent Our salaried entry-level recruitment efforts focus on recruiting relationships with universities, internship opportunities and partnerships with organizations that support diverse students.  We complement these recruiting efforts with hiring experienced employees with demonstrated skills and/or leadership capabilities. To help our employees succeed in their roles and develop in their careers, we emphasize ongoing training and leadership development opportunities.  Building skills that drive innovation and aligning our employees to our Vision is important for our long-term success.  The Human Resources department leads our learning and development efforts partnering with learning professionals embedded in functions throughout our operating and services companies.  Employees have access to a wide variety of development programs, including new employee onboarding, in-person, virtual and self-guided training programs, technical training, including training to maintain professional certifications, and our educational refund program for continuing education. An additional tool we use to motivate and recognize employees is our employee recognition program, Snap, which allows leaders and employees to reward and recognize colleagues for their outstanding performance and everyday excellence. We regularly conduct confidential employee engagement surveys to seek feedback on a variety of topics, including employee satisfaction, support from leadership, corporate culture and culture of compliance.  In addition, in 2022, we conducted quarterly employee surveys to gauge overall engagement and to obtain feedback on topics such as workplace flexibility, workload, inclusion, development opportunities, management support, compliance and understanding of business strategy.  Survey results, including comparisons to prior results, are shared with our employees and our Board and are used to modify or enhance our human capital management programs. Workplace Safety Our goal is for every Altria employee to experience an injury-free career, which is supported by our Safety Management System (\u201cSMS\u201d).  We strive for continuous improvement in our employee safety program through SMS infrastructure.  Our Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable injury rate for 2022 was 1.3% (versus 1.7% for 2021) and remains below the benchmark for companies in the U.S. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing industry classification. Number of Employees and Labor Relations At December\u00a031, 2022, we employed approximately 6,300 people.  Twenty-eight percent of our employees were hourly manufacturing employees who are members of labor unions subject to collective bargaining agreements.  We believe we engage and collaborate effectively with our hourly employees, as demonstrated by the positive working relationship between our companies and the unions.  We also have long-term agreements that resolve any collective bargaining dispute through binding arbitration, which further demonstrates our trust-based relationship with the unions. Supply Chain Human Capital Matters We support efforts to address human capital concerns in the tobacco supply chain.  For example, in our domestic tobacco supply chain, in 2022, all of our domestic tobacco growers participated in the Good Agricultural Practices Certification Program to assess growers\u2019 compliance with practices related to labor management and all of our tobacco suppliers participated in the tobacco industry\u2019s Sustainable Tobacco Program, which includes standards related to human and labor rights.  Our tobacco companies also establish contract terms and conditions with tobacco growers and leaf suppliers addressing child and forced labor and conduct social compliance audits at leaf supplier facilities in high-risk tobacco growing regions within the United States and internationally.  In addition, all suppliers of goods and services that maintain operations in high-risk countries are subject to social compliance audits of those operations. More information about efforts discussed in this section can be found in our Corporate Responsibility Reports at www.altria.com/responsibility. \u25aaIntellectual Property: Trademarks are of material importance to us and are protected by registration or otherwise.  In addition, as of December\u00a031, 2022, the portfolio of United States patents owned by our businesses, as a whole, was material to us and our tobacco businesses.  However, no one patent or group of related patents was material to our business or our tobacco businesses as of  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents December\u00a031, 2022.  Our businesses also have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are protected by appropriate confidentiality measures.  Certain trade secrets are material to us and our tobacco businesses. \u25aaGovernment Regulations: We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations.  For discussion of laws and regulations impacting our tobacco operating companies, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7. We and our subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are also subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as \u201cSuperfund\u201d), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party.  Our subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are involved in several matters subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under Superfund or other laws and regulations.  Our subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations.  As discussed in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (\u201cNote 2\u201d), we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.  Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that our subsidiaries may undertake in the future.  In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.
