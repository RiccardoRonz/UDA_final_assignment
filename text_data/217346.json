Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Textron Aviation Segment Textron Aviation is a leader in general aviation. Textron Aviation manufactures, sells and services Beechcraft and Cessna aircraft, and services the Hawker brand of business jets. The segment has two principal product lines: aircraft and aftermarket parts and services. Aircraft includes sales of business jets, turboprop aircraft, military trainer and defense aircraft and piston engine aircraft.  Aftermarket parts and services includes commercial parts sales and maintenance, inspection and repair services. Textron Aviation markets its products worldwide through its own sales force, as well as through a network of authorized independent sales representatives.   The family of jets currently offered by Textron Aviation includes the Citation M2 Gen2, Citation CJ3+, Citation CJ4 Gen2, Citation XLS Gen2, Citation Latitude and the Citation Longitude. Textron Aviation\u2019s turboprop aircraft include the Beechcraft King Air 260, King Air 360ER and King Air 360, and the Cessna Caravan, Grand Caravan EX and SkyCourier, which was certified in March 2022.

In addition, Able Aerospace Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Textron Aviation, provides component and maintenance, repair and overhaul services in support of commercial and military fixed- and rotor-wing aircraft. Product Development Programs Textron Aviation is developing the Denali, a high-performance single engine turboprop aircraft that will be powered by an engine expected to be up to 20% more efficient than similarly sized engines. The Denali achieved its first flight in November 2021 and is currently in the flight testing process. 3 3 3 Table of Contents  Table of Contents Bell Segment Bell is one of the leading suppliers of military and commercial helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and related spare parts and services in the world.  Bell supplies advanced military helicopters and provides parts and support services to the U.S. Government and to military customers outside the United States. Bell\u2019s primary U.S. Government programs are for the production and support of V-22 tiltrotor aircraft, primarily for the U.S. Department of Defense, and H-1 helicopters for the U.S. Marine Corps. Bell is one of the leading suppliers of helicopters to the U.S. Government and, in association with The Boeing Company, the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft. Tiltrotor aircraft are designed to provide the benefits of both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. The H-1 helicopter program includes a utility model, the UH-1Y, and an advanced attack model, the AH-1Z, which have 84% parts commonality between them. Under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program, Bell offers its V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and H-1 helicopter products for sale to other countries. Through its commercial business, Bell is a leading supplier of commercially certified helicopters and support to corporate, private, law enforcement, utility, public safety and emergency medical helicopter operators, and U.S. and foreign governments.  Bell produces a variety of commercial aircraft types, including light single- and twin-engine helicopters and medium twin-engine helicopters, along with other related products. The commercial helicopters currently offered by Bell include the 429, 407GXi, 412EPX, 412EPI, 505 Jet Ranger X and Huey II.  For both its military programs and its commercial products, Bell provides post-sale support and service for an installed base of approximately 13,000 helicopters through a network of eight Company-operated service centers, four global parts distribution centers and approximately 85 independent service centers located in approximately 35 countries. Collectively, these service sites offer a complete range of logistics support, including parts, support equipment, technical data, training devices, pilot and maintenance training, component repair and overhaul, engine repair and overhaul, aircraft modifications, aircraft customizing, accessory manufacturing, contractor maintenance, field service and product support engineering. Product Development Programs Bell is developing the V-280 Valor, a next generation vertical lift aircraft for the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program, which is part of the U.S. Army\u2019s Future Vertical Lift (FVL) initiative. The V-280 achieved its first flight in December 2017, conducted over 200 hours of flight testing, and has demonstrated all key performance objectives established by the U.S. Army, including flying in excess of 300 knots airspeed. After an extended competitive process, in December 2022, Bell was awarded the development contract for the next stage of the FLRAA program. A competitor has filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) regarding the award of the FLRAA contract to Bell, and a stop-work order has been issued pending resolution of the protest. We expect the GAO to issue its decision on the protest by April 7, 2023. Bell is developing a new rotorcraft, the Bell 360 Invictus, for the U.S. Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Competitive Prototype Program, which is also part of the U.S. government's FVL initiative. The FARA program was initiated by the U.S. Army to develop a successor to the retired Bell OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter. In March 2020, the U.S. Army selected the 360 Invictus to move to the second phase of the Competitive Prototype Program.  Bell continues to progress on its development of the 360 Invictus Prototype under this phase. Bell\u2019s first super medium commercial helicopter, the 525 Relentless, is currently in the certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts, such as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contracts. Our backlog at the end of 2022 and 2021 is summarized below: (In millions)December 31,2022January 1,2022Textron Aviation$6,387\u00a0$4,120\u00a0Bell4,781\u00a03,871\u00a0Textron Systems2,098\u00a02,144\u00a0Total backlog$13,266\u00a0$10,135\u00a0 U.S. Government Contracts and Other Governmental Regulation Our operations, products and services are subject to various government regulations, including regulations related to U.S. government business, international regulation of aviation products and services, and environmental regulations.  Contracts with the U.S. Government, including contracts under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program, generated approximately 22% of our consolidated revenues in 2022, primarily in our Bell and Textron Systems segments. We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things, require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation; define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts; and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified and  covered defense information and the export of certain products and technical data. New laws, regulations or procurement requirements, or changes to current ones, can significantly increase our costs, reducing our profitability.  Our contracts with the U.S. Government generally may be terminated by the U.S. Government for convenience or if we default in whole or in part by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract for convenience, we normally will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the effective date of termination, including, if applicable, reasonable profit on such work, as well as reasonable termination costs. If, however, the U.S. Government terminates a contract for default, generally: (a) we will be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted and services rendered, an agreed-upon amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of property, and an amount for partially completed products accepted by the U.S. Government; (b) the U.S. Government may not be liable for our costs with respect to unaccepted items and may be entitled to repayment of advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract; (c) the U.S. Government may not be liable for assets we own and utilize to provide services under the \u201cfee-for-service\u201d contracts; and (d) we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. See Aerospace and Defense Industry section in Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information related to regulation of U.S. Government business. Our commercial aircraft manufacturing businesses are regulated by the FAA in the U.S. and by similar aviation regulatory governing authorities internationally, including, the European Aviation Safety Agency. Maintenance facilities and aftermarket services must also comply with FAA and international regulations. These regulations address production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness. Aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority. See Strategic Risks section in Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information with respect to risks related to obtaining certification of new aircraft products. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. For additional information regarding environmental matters, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and Business and Operational Risks and Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal and Other Matters sections in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and we do not expect it to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, laws and regulations may be changed or adopted that impose additional compliance requirements which could necessitate capital expenditures or otherwise increase our costs of doing business, reducing our profitability and negatively impacting our operating results.  6 6 6 Table of Contents  Table of Contents Human Capital Resources At December\u00a031, 2022, we employed approximately 34,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 80% located in the U.S. and the remainder located outside of the U.S. Approximately 7,300, or 27%, of our U.S. employees, most of whom work for our Bell and Textron Aviation segments, are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements, and certain of our non-U.S. employees are represented by organized works councils. From time to time our collective bargaining agreements expire. Historically, we have been successful in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without any material disruption of operating activities, and management considers employee relations to be good.  Our success is highly dependent upon our ability to hire and retain a workforce with the skills necessary for our businesses to develop and manufacture the products desired by our customers. We need highly skilled personnel in multiple areas including, among others, engineering, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, flight operations, business development and strategy and management. In order to attract and retain highly skilled employees, we are committed to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment, offering comprehensive compensation and benefit programs, creating great career opportunities and building an engaging, inclusive environment where all employees are treated with dignity and respect. Health and Safety To maintain and enhance the safety of our employees, we promote a culture of continuous improvement and individual accountability to provide safe workplaces. We use an annual goal setting process to drive injury rate improvements, and the injury rate reduction goal is a performance metric that is tracked and reported to senior leadership and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  The health and safety of our employees has been a priority throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our enterprise-wide pandemic response teams, formed early in the pandemic, guided our operations in the processes and procedures to comply with applicable government-imposed health and safety-related operating restrictions, to enhance the safety of our facilities to protect the health of our employees and to monitor trends. During 2022, these teams continued to operate as needed, updating response actions as government guidance and orders evolved, and we have continued to communicate with our employees as appropriate.  Talent and Career Development Our talent development programs are designed to prepare our employees at all levels to take on new career and growth opportunities at Textron. Leadership, professional and functional training courses are tailored for employees at each stage of their careers and include a mix of enterprise-wide and business unit-specific programs. Textron University, an internal corporate function, provides (i) facilitated face-to-face professional and leadership development programs, (ii) web-based  general and specialized  functional and technical courses and (iii) an online portal to access advanced skills technical training, manage recertification of existing qualifications and other career planning tools and resources. The current and future talent needs of each of our businesses are assessed annually through a formal talent review process which enables us to develop leadership succession plans and provide our employees with potential new career opportunities. In addition, leaders from functional areas within each business belong to enterprise-wide councils which conduct annual talent reviews. These processes enable us to fill talent needs by matching employees who are ready to assume significant leadership roles with opportunities that best fit their career path, which may be in other businesses within the enterprise. Diversity and Inclusion Textron is committed to having a diverse workforce and inclusive workplaces throughout our global operations. We believe by employing highly talented, diverse employees, who feel valued, respected and are able to contribute fully, we will improve performance, innovation, collaboration and talent retention, all of which contributes to stronger business results and reinforces our reputation as leaders in our industries and communities. For over a decade, Textron has allocated five percent of annual incentive compensation for management-level employees toward achievement of diversity goals. Beginning in 2020, we focused these goals specifically on hiring diversity. To improve our outreach to diverse candidates, we have increased our recruiting efforts at historically black colleges and universities, enhanced our partnerships with diverse professional organizations and participated in diverse STEM conferences. In addition, we provide inclusion and unconscious bias training to our employees and recruiters to improve diversity in recruiting.
