From time to time, we also make strategic minority investments in other companies, mainly in the beauty industry.

Social Impact and Sustainability  We continue to integrate social impact and sustainability into our strategy and business operations. Our social impact and sustainability initiatives help drive innovation, growth and efficiency across the business and within our brand portfolio. These initiatives also aim to foster employee engagement and build consumer trust and loyalty.  Areas of focus include climate and energy; packaging; sourcing; green chemistry and ingredient transparency; inclusion, diversity and equity; employee health and safety; and social investments. We have set goals or made commitments within these focus areas. For example, our goals related to climate and energy support efficiency and conservation within our facilities, internal supply chain and value chain. Certain goals are also intended to help us reduce cost and waste.   Our Nominating and ESG Committee, one of our Board committees, has oversight responsibility for our Company\u2019s environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) activities and practices, including citizenship and sustainability matters. Our social impact and sustainability efforts are led by our Executive Chairman and our President and Chief Executive Officer. Other members of senior management, along with employees across the organization, help to drive our strategic initiatives concerning social impact and sustainability.  Additional information related to our social impact and sustainability matters can be found at www.elcompanies.com.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Distribution  We sell our prestige products through distribution channels that complement the luxury image and prestige status of our brands, and we provide \u201cHigh-Touch\u201d consumer experiences across our distribution channels. Our products are sold on our own and authorized retailer websites, on third-party online malls, in stores in airports, in duty-free locations and in our own and authorized freestanding stores. In addition, our products are sold in brick-and-mortar retail stores, including department stores, specialty-multi retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas.\u00a0Our general practice is to accept returns of our products from customers if properly requested and approved. Online, we sell products from most of our brands direct-to-consumer through our brand.com sites and third-party online malls. We also sell our products wholesale to authorized retailers that resell online through retailer.com and pure-play sites.\u00a0Our sites are in approximately 50 countries. While today a majority of these online sales are generated in mainland China, the United States and the United Kingdom, we continue to expand in other markets globally. As of June\u00a030, 2023, we operated approximately 1,600 freestanding stores.\u00a0The total reflects the net impact during fiscal 2023 of store closures related to the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program and closures due to natural lease expirations, offset by new door openings. Most freestanding stores are operated by us under a single brand name, such as M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Jo Malone London and Aveda. We also operate over 250 multi-branded company stores in outlet malls.\u00a0 We maintain dedicated sales teams that manage our retail accounts.\u00a0We have wholly-owned operations in over 50 countries through which we market, sell and distribute our products.\u00a0In certain countries, we sell our products through carefully selected distributors who we believe share our commitment to protecting the image and position of our brands.\u00a0For information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2013 Note 22 \u2013 Segment Data and Related Information. Our \u201cemerging markets\u201d in Europe, the Middle East & Africa are India, the Middle East, Turkey, South Africa, Central Europe, Israel, Russia and Kazakhstan; in Asia/Pacific are Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore; and in The Americas are Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Peru and Argentina. Customers  Our strategy is to build strong relationships globally with select retailers, and our senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis in support of these relationships. We believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers. In addition, we connect with our consumers directly through freestanding stores, e-commerce sites and social media to build a robust omnichannel experience that allows a consumer to shop in these and other channels.\u00a0  Marketing Our strategy to market and promote our products begins with our well-diversified portfolio of distinctive brands across four product categories.\u00a0Our portfolio can be deployed in multiple distribution channels, key travel corridors and geographies where our global reputation and awareness of our brands benefit us.\u00a0Our geographic and distribution channel diversity allows us to engage local consumers across an array of developed and emerging markets by emphasizing products and services with local relevance, inclusiveness and appeal. This strategy is built around \u201cBringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.\u201d\u00a0Our founder, Mrs.\u00a0Est\u00e9e Lauder, formulated this unique marketing philosophy to provide \u201cHigh-Touch\u201d service and high-quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base.\u00a0Our \u201cHigh-Touch\u201d approach is demonstrated through our integrated consumer engagement models that leverage our product specialists and technology to provide the consumer with a distinct and truly personalized experience that can include personal consultations with beauty advisors, in person or online, who demonstrate and educate the consumer on product usage and application.\u00a0As our business has grown and channel mix has evolved, we have further expanded our marketing philosophy and \u201cHigh-Touch\u201d execution to build both online and offline personalized consumer experiences through digital and physical demonstration, targeted digital media and tailored trial-to-loyalty pathways.\u00a0We plan to continue to leverage our core strengths, including the quality of our products, our \u201cHigh-Touch\u201d consumer engagement and a diversified portfolio of brands, channels and geographies.         9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Our marketing strategies vary by brand, local market and distribution channel.\u00a0We have a diverse portfolio of brands, and we employ different engagement models suited to each brand\u2019s equity, distribution, product focus, understanding of the core consumer and local relevance.\u00a0This enables us to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new consumers, create trial, build loyalty, drive consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors.\u00a0Hero products are at the core of our brand marketing strategies. They are the pillars of our brands and historically have provided strong results through high repeat sales and consumer loyalty. In addition to continuing to attract existing consumers, our hero products provide an opportunity for new consumers to be introduced to our desirable products, creating consumer traffic across all channels of distribution. We aim to further strengthen our hero products through continuous review of our product portfolio and strategic innovation. Our marketing planning approach leverages local insights to optimize allocation of resources across different media outlets and retail touch points to resonate with our most discerning consumers most effectively.\u00a0This includes strategically deploying our brands and tailoring product assortments and communications to fit local tastes and preferences in cities and neighborhoods.\u00a0Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house teams, in collaboration with external resources, that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand.\u00a0For a number of products, we create and deploy 360\u00b0 integrated consumer engagement programs.\u00a0We build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our own and authorized retailers\u2019 websites through digital and social media, magazines and newspapers, television, billboards in cities and airports, and direct mail and email.\u00a0In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products in digital and social media and print, to drive influencer amplification.  We are increasing our brand awareness and sales through our strategic emphasis on technology, by continuing to elevate our digital presence encompassing e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital, social media and influencer marketing.\u00a0We are investing in new analytical capabilities to promote a more personalized experience across our distribution channels.\u00a0We continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), support e-commerce and m-commerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and \u201cHigh-Touch\u201d consumer engagement, in order to continue to offer better experiences and services and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online.\u00a0We also support our authorized retailers to strengthen their e-commerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites.\u00a0We have opportunities to expand our brand portfolio online around the world, and we continue to invest in new omnichannel concepts in the United States, China and other markets to increase brand loyalty by better serving consumers as they shop across channels and travel corridors.\u00a0We have dedicated resources to implement creative, coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers.  Promotional activities, in-store displays, and online navigation are designed to attract new consumers, build demand and loyalty and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings from the respective brands.\u00a0Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as sampling programs, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase. Sampling is a key promotional activity as the quality and perceived benefits of sample products are very effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers.\u00a0Such activities attract consumers and keep existing consumers engaged.\u00a0Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers, retailers, beauty advisors and makeup artists at the points of sale to enable us to offer a seamless experience across channels of distribution.  As consumer behaviors, digital-first consumer journeys and e-commerce evolve, we adjust our direct-to-consumer business models and consumer engagement programs. These models and programs are designed to provide distinct one-to-one and one-to-many \u201cHigh-Touch\u201d omnichannel services and personalized experiences by leveraging technology and our talented beauty advisors, consultants, and makeup artists.  Information Technology Information technology, including operational technology and our websites, is a key enabler of all aspects of our business, from research and development, product development, production and distribution, to marketing, sales and order processing, consumer experiences as well as finance and human resources.\u00a0We continue to make strategic investments to align with our long-term strategy and to maintain and enhance our information technology and cybersecurity infrastructure. We are focused on optimizing adoption of such investments to maximize return on investment and realized value. The modernization and simplification of our technology ecosystem remains a key focus, as we increasingly leverage the benefits of the cloud.  We recognize that technology presents opportunities for competitive advantage, and we continue to invest in new capabilities and the use of emerging technologies across various aspects of our business.\u00a0In fiscal 2023, we made investments in research and pilots of technologies that serve and attract new consumers. As the working environment for our team members evolve, including hybrid ways of working for our employees, we continue to invest in hardware, software, education and support structures that drive productive, collaborative facilities and meeting spaces, both virtually and in person.  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Research and Development  We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products.\u00a0Our research and development group, which includes scientists, engineers, analysts, and other employees involved in product and packaging innovation, works closely with our marketing and product development teams and third-party suppliers to generate ideas, develop new products and product-line extensions, create new packaging concepts, and improve, redesign or reformulate existing products.\u00a0In addition, these research and development personnel provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver environmentally responsible products that meet or exceed consumer expectations.\u00a0The research and development group has both long-standing and continually growing research-based working relationships with several U.S. and international dermatology and medical institutions, research universities and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities. Members of the research and development group are also responsible for product safety, registration and regulatory compliance matters.\u00a0As our business continues to grow globally, and to satisfy the demand for locally relevant consumer products, we have increased our focus on innovation in Asia/Pacific, especially in China, as well as in Japan and Korea. In fiscal 2023, we completed construction of a newly leased site for our new Research and Development facility in China, to better meet the needs of the Chinese consumer through local relevancy with superior capabilities in product and package design and consumer and clinical testing.  Our research and development costs totaled $344 million,\u00a0$307 million and $243 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.\u00a0As of June\u00a030, 2023, we had approximately 1,290 employees engaged in research and development activities.\u00a0We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see Item 2. Properties. Manufacturing, Warehousing and Raw Materials We manufacture our products primarily in our own facilities in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada and also leverage global third-party manufacturing networks.\u00a0We continue to evaluate our manufacturing facilities and processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment, ensure supply sufficiency and reduce costs.\u00a0Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated.\u00a0In fiscal 2023, we began limited production in our new owned manufacturing facility near Tokyo as we continued construction, which is expected to enable us to better meet demand, further drive our sustainability efforts, optimize costs and increase speed to market in the Asia/Pacific region, including our travel retail business within the region. We expect the remainder of the site to be completed and operational in early fiscal 2024, with production levels scaling over the next few years. While we believe that our manufacturing network of internal and external sites is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated increased requirements, we continue to implement improvements in capacity, technology, and productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand to be more agile.\u00a0From time to time, demand changes may challenge our capacity for certain subcategories on a short-term basis, but we believe that these changes will not impact our ability to meet our long-term strategic objectives.\u00a0 We have established a flexible global distribution network that is managed by us or third parties. The network is designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.\u00a0We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network, particularly as we work to anticipate and respond to channel shifts.\u00a0We have established regional and local distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers and consumers. In fiscal 2022, we opened a new, state-of-the-art distribution center in Switzerland to support the growth of our travel retail business and further drive our sustainability efforts. During fiscal 2023, we continued to support the growth of our business in China with the opening of an additional distribution center in Guangzhou.  As discussed above, we continue to focus on social impact and sustainability across our operations. Focus areas include employee health and safety and minimizing our impact on the environment. This is achieved, in part, through investment in equipment while enhancing the work environment through safe practices and capabilities. We also engage in initiatives to improve our equipment and buildings to support and deliver our sustainability goals and reduce our impact on the environment. Environmental efforts include waste reduction, zero industrial waste to landfill, investments in renewable energy sources and packaging that incorporates recyclable and recycled content.     11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents  The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals.\u00a0We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications.\u00a0Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations function.\u00a0We also partner with an extensive and reliable network of third-party manufacturers that help us access innovation and capacity. We review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation and speed-to-market, ensuring supply sufficiency and reducing costs.\u00a0In addition, we focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies, lead-time reduction and reduced emissions.\u00a0  Some of our products rely on single-source or a limited number of suppliers; however, we believe we have a robust business continuity strategy, sophisticated capacity planning tools and strategic inventory buffer and multi-sourcing solutions.\u00a0In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and packaging components for virtually all materials used in the production of our products. From time to time, we may experience supply disruptions on a short-term basis, but we currently believe we have adequate resources of supply and that our portfolio of suppliers has the resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.   We are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain, and we augment our supply base and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing plants and networks based upon the changing needs of the business.\u00a0As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance. Competition There is significant competition within each market where our skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products are sold.\u00a0Brand recognition, product quality and effectiveness, distribution channels, accessibility, and price point are some of the factors that impact consumers\u2019 choices among competing products and brands.\u00a0There continues to be increased interest and awareness from our customers and consumers in responsibly-sourced ingredients and environmentally sustainable products, and we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the resulting change in consumer preferences due to our social impact and sustainability efforts. Marketing, merchandising, in-store and online experiences and demonstrations, and new product innovations also have an impact on consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. With our portfolio of diverse brands sold in a variety of channels, we are one of the world\u2019s leading manufacturers, marketers and sellers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, and are a steward of luxury and prestige brands globally.

Our Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight to management on a range of human capital matters, including inclusion and diversity, health and safety, pay equity and compensation and benefits. We had approximately 62,000 and 63,000 employees worldwide, including demonstrators at points of sale who are employed by us, as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At June 30, 2023, approximately 71% of our global employees were full-time, approximately 16% were temporary and approximately 13% were part-time employees, with approximately 28% of our global employees located in the United States and approximately 72% located outside of the United States. We recognize the importance of female representation, and, as of June 30, 2023, approximately 80% of our employees were female and approximately 59% of our employees at the level of Vice President and above were female. We have no employees in the United States that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by works council agreements or other syndicate arrangements. Inclusion, Diversity and Equity  We are committed to supporting an inclusive and diverse workplace that better enables us to create innovative products and services as we continually strive to meet the evolving needs of our diverse global consumers. Our objective in creating an environment of inclusion, diversity and equity is to enhance our ability to attract and retain the best talent globally and promote a sense of belonging. We continuously encourage a culture of fairness, equal access to opportunities, including positions of leadership, and transparency in employment matters. We have enhanced our strategy in many areas including hiring, employee engagement, development and talent management to further support inclusion, diversity and equity across the organization.   We are proud of our history of driving awareness and acceptance around the world and for standing up for the rights of individuals in the workplace and beyond. We remained resolute in our commitment to prioritize racial equity, diligently advancing our previously announced series of commitments across the business, with a focus on U.S. operations. Areas where we have made commitments include programs related to listening and learning, talent and opportunity, representation, suppliers and investing in change.   We are also committed to gender equity and equitable pay practices. We have a number of programs to help accelerate the development and promotion of women, such as our Women's Leadership Network, and remain committed to the achievement of gender pay equity across the organization.  We continue to prioritize cross-generational inclusion and diversity to help cultivate talent within our workforce. We are committed to various programs to continue our investment at all levels of seniority and tenure, including our Global Reverse Mentor Program that pairs seasoned leaders with more junior talent and was designed to give insights to the leadership team on current millennial and Gen Z habits, preferences and trends.     13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Talent Recruitment, Retention, Learning and Development  Hiring, retaining and developing the best talent globally is key to our success in sustaining long-term growth. Our talent strategy is focused on employee engagement and investments in career development, as well as measuring, recognizing and rewarding business and leadership performance. Our investments include providing programs to ensure our employees are equipped with the right skillsets and knowledge, as well as opportunities to transfer to other functions or regions through short-term and long-term assignments. We believe these programs and opportunities create a pipeline of talent and leadership, necessary to drive and deliver on our long-term strategy.  To enhance our culture and measure our human capital objectives, we regularly engage with our employees. We provide several mechanisms for our employees to provide their feedback, including direct discussions with managers, employee surveys and interactive townhall meetings. Key topics covered during employee engagement include inclusion, diversity and equity, learning and development, work-life structure, leadership effectiveness, and employee benefits. Based on our review of employee survey results, action plans are implemented to enhance employee satisfaction and to ensure alignment with our overall human capital strategy. In fiscal 2022, we responded to employee need for more access to career opportunities by launching our first Talent Marketplace, ELC Grow, which enables employees to explore personalized roles, projects, and networking opportunities that can empower employees to grow their skills and career. We are expanding access to this marketplace to all employees globally in fiscal 2024. An important element of our talent strategy is succession planning and building leadership at various levels across the organization. We regularly discuss potential successors to key roles, review relevant backgrounds and capabilities and develop succession plans accordingly.  To enhance innovation, productivity and our speed to market, we aim to foster an environment of curiosity and to create a workplace that encourages continuous learning and development. We offer training and development programs that are focused on strengthening leadership and professional skills at various stages of an employee\u2019s career. Our programs are offered through in-person, online or virtual learning experiences. As our ways of working continue to evolve, we have adjusted and reprioritized our training and development programs and delivery methods to meet the needs of our employees who are working from home. These changes included delivering learning experiences around subject matters such as managing remotely, mental health awareness and building resilience during uncertain times, as well as pivoting traditional in-person sessions to virtual instructor-led learning. In addition, we continue to curate digital content to support \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d focus areas, such as performance development, as well as socially relevant information around racial justice and inclusion and diversity.  Health and Safety  We are committed to providing a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We establish and update safety policies and procedures, train employees on our safety guidelines and local requirements, and create a culture focused on safety through ongoing communication, awareness and engagement. As we plan for the future,  our focus is on flexibility, work-life harmonization, and ensuring that our employees have what they need to succeed personally and professionally.   Employee Rewards  We offer compelling and competitive compensation packages with the objectives to attract, motivate and retain world-class talent, and we are committed to fair and equitable pay across the organization. Employee compensation is based on specific circumstances, including role and experience, geographic location and performance. In addition to base pay, we offer annual incentive awards and equity awards for employees at certain job grades.   To support the health and well-being of our employees, we offer competitive benefit packages that may include pension and post-retirement benefit plans, health and wellness benefits, flexible working arrangements, parental (maternal and paternal) leave, adoption assistance and education-related benefits, which may vary by country.      14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Volunteerism and Community Engagement  We are dedicated to being active and respectful citizens, and we engage in philanthropic and employee volunteering efforts to enhance the communities we touch. We are inspired by the generosity of our employees and encourage them to become involved in their communities by offering programs to support the causes that matter to them. To empower employees, ELC Good Works, our global charitable and volunteerism program, allows eligible employees to create and participate in volunteer activities, with their cash donations matched by the Company and volunteer hours rewarded through additional cash donations by the Company.  Government Regulation  We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.\u00a0Such laws and regulations relate to a wide range of matters including ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, transport and the sale, disposal and safety of our products, as well as environmental matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s capital expenditures, including capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, earnings or competitive position.  Seasonality Our results of operations in total, by geographic region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.\u00a0The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by consumers for special events and by retailers for holiday selling seasons.\u00a0Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions or the particular retail calendars followed by our customers that are retailers, which may impact their order placement and receipt of goods.\u00a0Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by holiday and key shopping moments, as well as variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.
