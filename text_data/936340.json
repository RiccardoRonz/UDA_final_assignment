Refer to Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this Report for an in-depth analysis of each segment\u2019s financial results.  A description of each business unit follows.   ELECTRIC Description DTE Energy's Electric segment consists principally of DTE Electric, an electric utility engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity to approximately 2.3 million customers in southeastern Michigan.  DTE Electric is regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC, the FERC, the NRC, the EPA, and EGLE.  Electricity is generated from fossil-fuel plants, a hydroelectric pumped storage plant, a nuclear plant, wind and solar assets, and is supplemented with purchased power.  The electricity is sold, or distributed through the retail access program, to three major classes of customers: residential, commercial, and industrial, throughout southeastern Michigan. Weather, economic factors, competition, energy waste reduction initiatives, and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers.  DTE Electric's peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year, driven by air conditioning and other cooling-related demands.  DTE Electric's operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of DTE Electric. The Electric segment also includes non-utility operations relating to renewable energy projects at DTE Sustainable Generation, which were acquired to support DTE Energy's renewable energy goals. For a summary of Electric segment operating revenues by service, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Revenue.\" Fuel Supply and Purchased Power DTE Electric's power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power.  DTE Electric expects to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet its obligation to serve customers.  DTE Electric's generating capability is dependent upon the availability of coal and natural gas. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms.  DTE Electric expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through long-term contracts, with the balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot purchases.  DTE Electric has long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase of approximately 10 million tons of low-sulfur western coal and approximately 1 million tons of Appalachian coal to be delivered from 2023 to 2024.  All of these contracts have pricing schedules.  DTE Electric has 96% of its expected coal requirements under contract for 2023.  DTE Electric leases a fleet of rail cars and has the expected western and eastern coal rail requirements under multi-year contracts.  DTE Electric's 2023 rail transportation is covered under long-term agreements.  DTE Electric expects to cover all of its 2023 vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to electric generating facilities through existing agreements.  DTE Electric's natural gas supply requirements are expected to be met through a combination of short and long-term agreements, agreements with local distribution companies, and spot market purchases.  Natural gas purchase requirements for 2023 are expected to be approximately 64 Bcf.  DTE Electric has contracts for firm gas transportation and storage capacity to ensure reliable and flexible gas supply to its power plants.  Given the geographic diversity of supply, DTE Electric believes it can meet its expected generation requirements. DTE Electric participates in the energy market through MISO.  DTE Electric offers its generation in the market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve its load.  DTE Electric is a net purchaser of power that supplements its generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Properties DTE Electric owns generating facilities that are located in the State of Michigan.  Substantially all of DTE Electric's property is subject to the lien of a mortgage.

Of the 560 MW, currently 52 MW relate to power purchase agreements with DTE Sustainable Generation. See \"Capital Investments\" in Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this Report for information regarding plant retirements and future capital expenditures. DTE Electric owns and operates 697 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 37,178,000 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and approximately 451,900 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 33,079,000 kVA. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Circuit miles of electric distribution lines owned and in service as of December\u00a031, 2022 are shown in the following table: Circuit MilesOperating Voltage-Kilovolts (kV)OverheadUnderground4.8 kV to 13.2 kV28,548\u00a015,772\u00a024 kV177\u00a0732\u00a040 kV2,353\u00a0465\u00a0120 kV59\u00a08\u00a031,137\u00a016,977\u00a0 There are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between DTE Electric and electricity providers external to the DTE Electric service area.  These interconnections are generally owned and operated by ITC Transmission, an unrelated company, and connect to neighboring energy companies. Regulation DTE Electric is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC, the FERC, and the NRC.  The MPSC issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting, and operating-related matters.  DTE Electric's MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on investments.  The FERC regulates DTE Electric with respect to financing authorization, wholesale electric market activities, certain affiliate transactions, the acquisition and disposition of certain generation and other facilities, and, in conjunction with the NERC, compliance with mandatory reliability standards. The NRC has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation, construction, licensing, and decommissioning of DTE Electric's nuclear plant operations.  DTE Electric is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment, and health. See Notes 8, 9, 12, 18, and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Fair Value,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" and \" Nuclear Operations.\" Energy Assistance Programs Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain critical to DTE Electric\u2019s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses.  DTE Electric\u2019s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded assistance that qualifying customers receive.  DTE Electric works continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of low-income individuals in the service territory.  DTE Electric also partners with federal, state, and local officials to attempt to increase the share of low-income funding allocated to customers. Strategy and Competition DTE Electric's electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a cost-effective manner and support DTE Energy's goal to reduce carbon emissions by 32% by 2023, 65% in 2028, 85% in 2035, and 90% by 2040 from 2005 carbon emissions levels, as well as net zero emissions by 2050.  These represent accelerated goals compared to DTE Electric's prior targets to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2028 and 80% by 2040.  With potential capacity constraints in the MISO region, there will be increased dependency on DTE Electric's generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers. To maintain reliability and meet targeted carbon reduction goals in the near-term, DTE Electric will continue its energy waste reduction initiatives and transition away from coal-fired plants to renewable energy and other sources, including leveraging existing infrastructure at the Belle River power plant through a coal to natural gas conversion.  To achieve long-term carbon reduction goals, DTE Electric plans to end the use of coal-fired power plants in 2035 and plans significant investments in solar, wind, and battery storage.  DTE Electric expects this transition to renewables and natural gas to reduce future operating and fuel costs.  DTE Electric will also continue to monitor the advancement of emerging technologies such as long-duration storage, modular nuclear reactors, hydrogen, and carbon capture and sequestration, and how these technologies may support clean, reliable generation and customer affordability. 10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents DTE Electric's distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe, cost-effective, and reliable manner to customers.  An increasing intensity of wind storms and other weather events, coupled with increasing electric vehicle adoption, will drive a continued need for substantial grid investment over the long-term.  DTE Electric is hardening and upgrading its infrastructure and has plans to build substations to provide additional capacity as customers shift to more electrification, including electric vehicles.  DTE Electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to maintain rate affordability and increase reliability and customer satisfaction through tree trimming, pole maintenance, and other projects. DTE Electric expects opportunities to enhance customer affordability as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in August 2022, which includes production tax credits for wind and solar production and existing nuclear generation, as well as investment tax credits for energy storage.  DTE Electric expects these tax incentives to reduce the cost of owning assets that support its clean energy transition, thereby reducing customer rate impacts from any future cost recoveries. The electric retail access program in Michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers, subject to limits.  Energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan has placed a 10% cap on total retail access.  This cap mitigates some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on DTE Electric's financial performance and full-service customer rates.  Customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers and represented approximately 10%, 10%, and 8.5% of retail sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.   DTE Electric expects that customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will remain at approximately 10% of retail sales in 2023 and future years. Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the on-site generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers.  DTE Electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term. Revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions, economic factors, regulatory events, and other risk factors as discussed in the \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A. of this Report.   GAS Description DTE Energy's Gas segment consists principally of DTE Gas, a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase, storage, transportation, distribution, and sale of natural gas to approximately 1.3 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers throughout Michigan, and the sale of storage and transportation capacity. DTE Gas' natural gas sales, end-user transportation, and intermediate transportation volumes, revenues, and Net Income are impacted by weather.  Given the seasonal nature of the business, revenues and earnings are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year.  By the end of the first quarter, the heating season is largely over, and DTE Gas typically realizes substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter, and losses in the third quarter.  The impacts of changes in annual average customer usage may be minimized by Revenue Decoupling Mechanisms authorized by the MPSC. DTE Gas operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of DTE Gas. For a summary of Gas segment operating revenues by service, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Revenue.\" Natural Gas Supply DTE Gas' gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily send-out capacity of 2.4 Bcf, with approximately 64% of the volume coming from underground storage for 2022.  Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, and purchased gas supplies.  Because of the geographic diversity of supply and its pipeline transportation and storage capacity, DTE Gas is able to reliably meet supply requirements.  DTE Gas believes natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future. 11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents DTE Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and maintains a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts.  Supplier, producing region, quantity, and available transportation diversify DTE Gas' natural gas supply base.  Natural gas supply is obtained from various sources in different geographic areas (Appalachian, Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Canada, and Michigan) under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms.  Gas supply pricing is generally tied to the New York Mercantile Exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with MPSC-approved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2025. DTE Gas is directly connected to interstate pipelines, providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the Appalachian, Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Canadian regions.  The primary long-term transportation supply contracts at December\u00a031, 2022 are listed below.

The distribution system includes approximately 21,000\u00a0miles of distribution mains, approximately 1,352,000 service pipelines, and approximately 1,316,000 active meters.  DTE Gas also owns approximately 2,000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect DTE Gas storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas. DTE Gas owns storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 139 Bcf.  These facilities are important in providing reliable and cost-effective service to DTE Gas customers.  In addition, DTE Gas sells storage services to third parties. Most of DTE Gas' distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by DTE Gas through easements, permits, or licenses.  Substantially all of DTE Gas' property is subject to the lien of a mortgage. DTE Gas leases a portion of its pipeline system through a finance lease arrangement.  See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Leases.\" Regulation DTE Gas is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting, and operating-related matters.  DTE Gas' MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on investments.  DTE Gas operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in Michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the MPSC and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to a MPSC-approved tariff. DTE Gas also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an Operating Statement on file with the FERC.  The FERC's jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates, non-discriminatory requirements, and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by DTE Gas in interstate markets.  FERC granted DTE Gas authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at market-based rates.  DTE Gas provides transportation services in interstate commerce at cost-based rates approved by the MPSC and filed with the FERC. DTE Gas is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment, and health. See Notes 9 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Commitments and Contingencies.\" 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents Energy Assistance Programs Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain critical to DTE Gas' ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses.  DTE Gas' uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded assistance its qualifying customers receive.  DTE Gas works continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of low-income individuals in the service territory.  DTE Gas also partners with federal, state, and local officials to attempt to increase the share of low-income funding allocated to customers. Strategy and Competition DTE Gas' strategy is to ensure the safe, reliable, and cost-effective delivery of natural gas service within its franchised markets in Michigan.  In addition, DTE Gas is promoting the extension of its distribution system to underserved markets and the increased use of natural gas furnaces, water heaters, and appliances within its current customer base.  DTE Gas continues to focus on the reduction of operating costs and the delivery of energy waste reduction products and services to its customers, making natural gas service the preferred fuel and even more affordable for its customers. Competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers, as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources.  The primary focus of competition for end-user transportation is cost and reliability.  Some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal, electricity, oil, and steam.  If these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source, they would not have a need for DTE Gas' end-user transportation service.  DTE Gas competes against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service, supported by its storage capacity. Having an extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled marketing of DTE Gas' storage and transportation services to gas producers, marketers, distribution companies, end-user customers, and other pipeline companies.  The business operates in a central geographic location with connections to major Midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the Midwest, eastern United States, and eastern Canada. DTE Gas' storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to its customers and is also sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements.  Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions, weather, and natural gas pricing. DTE Energy plans to reduce the carbon emissions from its gas utility operations by 65% by 2030 and 80% by 2040, and is committed to a goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 from internal gas operations and gas suppliers.  To achieve net zero, DTE Gas is working to source gas with lower methane intensity, reduce emissions through its main renewal and pipeline integrity programs, and if necessary, use carbon offsets to address any remaining emissions.  DTE Energy also aims to help DTE Gas customers reduce their emissions by 35% by 2040 by increasing energy efficiency, pursuing advanced technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and sequestration, and through the CleanVision Natural Gas Balance program which provides customers the option to use carbon offsets and renewable natural gas.   DTE VANTAGE Description DTE Vantage is comprised primarily of renewable energy projects that sell electricity and pipeline-quality gas and projects that deliver customer energy solutions to industrial, commercial, and institutional customers.  This business segment provides services using project assets usually located on or near the customers' premises in the agricultural, steel, automotive, airport, chemical, and other industries as follows: 13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents Renewable Energy \u2022Renewable Gas Recovery \u2014 DTE Vantage has ownership interests in, and operates, twenty-two gas recovery sites in nine states.  The sites recover methane from landfills and agricultural businesses and convert the gas to generate electricity and replace fossil fuels in industrial and manufacturing operations.  Certain sites also refine the methane to produce pipeline-quality gas and generate environmental attributes, including environmental credits from California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and in some cases may generate tax credits.  The gas is then sold to off-takers, along with the environmental attributes, to be used as low carbon transportation fuel. \u2022Wholesale Power and Renewables \u2014 DTE Vantage holds ownership interests in, and operates, four renewable generating plants with a capacity of 139 MWs.

DTE Vantage will also continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties.  There are limited competitors for DTE Vantage's existing disparate businesses who provide similar products and services.  DTE Vantage's operations are dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of DTE Vantage. DTE Vantage anticipates building around its core strengths in the markets where it operates.  In determining the markets in which to compete, DTE Vantage examines closely the regulatory and competitive environment, new and pending legislation, the number of competitors, and its ability to achieve sustainable margins.  DTE Vantage plans to maximize the effectiveness of its related businesses as it expands.  DTE Vantage also expects enhanced opportunities as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in August 2022, including increased tax credits for renewable natural gas and carbon capture and sequestration. DTE Vantage intends to focus on the following areas for growth: \u2022Acquiring and developing renewable energy projects and other energy projects \u2022Providing energy and utility-type services to commercial and industrial customers \u2022Developing decarbonization opportunities related to carbon capture and sequestration projects   ENERGY TRADING Description Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power, natural gas and environmental marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions.  Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power, environmental and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers\u2019 behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers.  Energy Trading's customer base is predominantly utilities, local natural gas distribution companies, pipelines, producers and generators, and other marketing and trading companies.  Energy Trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within DTE Energy. Energy Trading enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its marketing and hedging activities.  These financial instruments are generally accounted for under the MTM method, which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives.  Energy Trading utilizes forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with marketing and trading activity, as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines.   Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged.  Most financial instruments, physical power and natural gas contracts, and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives; whereas, natural gas and environmental inventory, contracts for pipeline transportation, storage assets, and some environmental contracts are not derivatives.  As a result, this segment will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets.  The business\u2019 strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps, and options.  This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods. Regulation Energy Trading has market-based rate authority from the FERC to sell power and blanket authority from the FERC to sell natural gas at market prices.  Energy Trading is subject to FERC reporting requirements and market behavior rules.  Energy Trading is also subject to the applicable laws, rules, and regulations related to the CFTC, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and DOE.  In addition, Energy Trading is subject to applicable laws, rules, and regulations in Canada. 15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents Strategy and Competition DTE Energy's strategy for the Energy Trading business is to deliver value-added services to DTE Energy customers.  DTE Energy seeks to manage this business in a manner complementary to the growth of DTE Energy's other business segments.  Energy Trading focuses on physical marketing and the optimization of its portfolio of energy assets.  The segment competes with electric and gas marketers, financial institutions, traders, utilities, and other energy providers.  The Energy Trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating.  DTE Energy believes it has ample available capital capacity to support Energy Trading activities.  DTE Energy monitors its use of capital closely to ensure that its commitments do not exceed capacity.  A material credit restriction would negatively impact Energy Trading's financial performance.  Competitors with greater access to capital, or at a lower cost, may have a competitive advantage.  DTE Energy has risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk.   CORPORATE AND OTHER Corporate and Other includes various holding company activities, holds certain non-utility debt, and holds certain investments, including funds supporting regional development and economic growth.   ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers.  The following table summarizes DTE Energy's, including DTE Electric's, estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations.  Pending or future reconsideration of current regulations may impact the estimated expenditures summarized in the table below.  Actual costs to comply could vary substantially.  Additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented.
