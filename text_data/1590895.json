{"cik": 1590895, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business Overview We are a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, we grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. in 2017 and Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018 and a merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation (\u201cFormer Caesars\u201d) on July 20, 2020, pursuant to which Former Caesars became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the \u201cMerger\u201d) and our ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market changed from \u201cERI\u201d to \u201cCZR\u201d. In addition, on April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC (the \u201cWilliam Hill Acquisition\u201d). Our primary source of revenue is generated by casino properties\u2019 gaming operations, including retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming, and we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we own, lease or manage an aggregate of 51 domestic properties in 16 states with approximately 52,800 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 2,800 table games and approximately 47,200 hotel rooms. We also operate and conduct sports wagering across 28 jurisdictions in North America, 20 of which are mobile for sports betting, and operate regulated online real money gaming in six jurisdictions in North America. We continue to expand into additional markets as jurisdictions legalize forms of retail and online gaming and sports betting. In addition, we have other domestic and international properties that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. We lease certain real property assets from third parties, including GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (\u201cGLPI\u201d) and VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (\u201cVICI\u201d). See Item 2, \u201cProperties,\u201d for more information about our properties.  Significant Transactions in 2022 On April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for \u00a32.9\u00a0billion, or approximately $3.9\u00a0billion with the intent to divest William Hill PLC\u2019s non-U.S. operations, which included the United Kingdom and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, \u201cWilliam Hill International\u201d). We entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately \u00a32.2\u00a0billion which, on April 7, 2022, we amended for a revised enterprise value of approximately \u00a32.0\u00a0billion. The amended agreement reflected a \u00a3250\u00a0million reduction in consideration payable at closing and up to \u00a3100\u00a0million of deferred consideration to be paid to Caesars, subject to 888 Holdings Plc meeting certain 2023 financial targets. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, we recorded impairments to assets held for sale of $503\u00a0million within discontinued operations based on the revised and final sales prices. On July 1, 2022, we completed the sale of William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc and outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement, between the Company and certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as administrative agent and collateral agent, were immediately repaid. After the repayment of the Bridge Credit Agreement, other permitted leakage, and the settlement of related forward contracts, we received net proceeds of $730\u00a0million. Including open market repurchases and repayments, we utilized all $730\u00a0million to reduce our outstanding debt. On May 5, 2022, we consummated the sale of the equity interests of Belle of Baton Rouge Casino & Hotel (\u201cBaton Rouge\u201d) to CQ Holding Company, Inc., subject to customary closing conditions, resulting in a loss of $3\u00a0million. Baton Rouge was within the Regional segment. Table of Contents4 Table of Contents4 Table of Contents 4   Developments related to COVID-19 Despite the resurgence of the COVID-19 Omicron variant at the beginning of the year, operations at many of our properties experienced positive trends during much of the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, including higher hotel occupancy, particularly in Las Vegas, and increased gaming and food and beverage volumes. The reduction in mandates and restrictions, combined with pent up consumer demand and supplemental discretionary spend from governmental stimulus, resulted in strong results across our properties during 2021. Future variants, mandates or restrictions imposed by various regulatory bodies are uncertain and could have a significant impact on our future operations. Business Operations Our consolidated business is composed of complementary businesses that reinforce, cross-promote, and build upon each other: casino, which includes our online sports betting and iGaming, food and beverage, hotel, casino management services, entertainment, retail and other business operations. Casino Operations Our casino operations generate revenues from approximately 52,800 slot machines, 2,800 table games, including poker, sports betting from our retail and online sportsbooks, iGaming and other games such as keno, all of which comprised approximately 55% of our total net revenues in 2022. Slot revenues generate the majority of our casino revenues. Online Sports Betting and iGaming As a result of our acquisition of William Hill PLC on April 22, 2021, we significantly expanded our online sports betting and iGaming presence. We operate and conduct sports wagering across 28 jurisdictions in North America as of December\u00a031, 2022. Additionally, we operate regulated online real money gaming businesses in six jurisdictions in North America and continue to leverage the World Series of Poker (\u201cWSOP\u201d) brand, and license the WSOP trademarks for a variety of products and services. We offer hundreds of online casino games including slots, table games, live dealer and video poker and we expect to increase our product offerings as iGaming is legalized in additional states. Extensive usage of digital platforms, continued legalization in additional jurisdictions, and growing bettor demand are driving the market for online sports betting platforms in the United States and the William Hill Acquisition positioned us to address this growing market. On August 2, 2021, we launched our Caesars Sportsbook app on our owned and integrated technology platform we have labeled Liberty (\u201cLiberty\u201d). We launched a significant marketing campaign with distinguished actors, athletes and media personalities promoting the launch of the Caesars Sportsbook app. The app offers extensive pre-match and live markets, extensive odds and flexible limits, player props, and same-game parlays. Caesars Sportsbook has partnerships with the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and several individual teams, while being the exclusive odds provider for ESPN and CBS Sports. We have continued to create new partnerships among professional sports teams and, in 2021, entered into a 20-year exclusive naming-rights partnership branding the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. In addition to the Caesars Sportsbook app, the Company and NYRABets LLC, the official online wagering platform of the New York Racing Association, Inc., launched the Caesars Racebook app. The Caesars Racebook app operates in eight states and provides access for pari-mutuel wagering at over 300 racetracks around the world as well as livestreaming of races. Wagers placed can earn credits towards the Caesars Rewards loyalty program or points which can be redeemed for free wagering credits. Growth in the Caesars Digital segment continues to be realized with the strategic expansion into new states as jurisdictions legalize retail and online sports betting and online horse race wagering. Sports Brand Partnerships \u2014 Our strategy includes developing local and national partnerships that align our sportsbooks, casinos, resorts and brands with sports fans. We have high-profile exclusive sports entertainment partnerships with the NFL, making Caesars the first-ever \u201cOfficial Casino Sponsor\u201d in the history of the league. This historic partnership combines the NFL\u2019s legendary events with our properties to bring unique experiences to Caesars\u2019 patrons. This includes exclusive rights to use NFL trademarks to promote our properties and enabling Caesars to host exclusive special events and experiences. Caesars expects to continue to host brand activations at prominent, high-profile NFL events, including the NFL Draft, NFL playoffs, and the Super Bowl during this multi-year partnership. Food and Beverage Operations Our food and beverage operations generate revenues from our dining venues, bars, nightclubs, and lounges located throughout our casinos and represented approximately 15% of our total net revenues in 2022. Many of our properties include several dining options, ranging from upscale dining experiences to moderately-priced restaurants, some of which offer pickup or in-room delivery options. Table of Contents5 Table of Contents5 Table of Contents 5   Hotel Operations Hotel operations generate revenues from hotel stays at our properties in our approximately 47,200 guest rooms and suites worldwide and represented approximately 18% of our total net revenues in 2022. Our properties operate at various price and service points, allowing us to host a variety of casino guests, who are visiting our properties for gaming and other casino entertainment options, and non-casino guests who are visiting our properties for other purposes, such as vacation travel or conventions.  Management and Branding Arrangements We earn revenue from fees paid for the management of domestic and international hotels and casinos. Managed properties represent Caesars-branded properties where we provide certain staffing and management services under management agreements. In addition, we authorize the use of certain brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc from which we earn revenue from fees received based on the arrangements. Entertainment and Other Non-Gaming Operations We provide a variety of retail and entertainment offerings at our properties. We operate various entertainment venues across the United States, including the Colosseum at Caesars Palace and Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood. These award-winning entertainment venues host or have announced plans to host, prominent headliners, such as Garth Brooks, Sting, Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert. The LINQ Promenade is an open-air dining, entertainment, and retail development located between The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Flamingo Las Vegas, which features The High Roller, a 550-foot observation wheel, and Fly LINQ, the first and only zipline on the Las Vegas Strip. The retail stores offer guests a wide range of options from high-end brands and accessories to souvenirs and decorative items. CAESARS FORUM is a 550,000 square-foot state-of-the-art conference center located at the center of the Las Vegas Strip. CAESARS FORUM can accommodate more than 10,000 participants and features more than 300,000 square feet of flexible meeting space, the two largest pillarless ballrooms in the world, a LEED silver-rated FORUM Plaza, and the first 100,000 square-foot outdoor meeting and event space in\u00a0Las Vegas. Market Activities Trends Economic Factors Impacting Discretionary Spending \u2014 Gaming and other leisure activities we offer represent discretionary expenditures which may be sensitive to economic downturns. The resurgence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 continued to impact the beginning of the year, however, many of our properties experienced positive trends during much of the year ended December 31, 2022 including higher hotel occupancy and rates, particularly in Las Vegas, and increased gaming and food and beverage volumes coupled with improved product mix. During 2021, mandates and restrictions on maximum capacities and amenities available were eased, discretionary consumer spending was supplemented via governmental stimulus, and pent-up consumer demand from the prolonged impact of COVID-19 resulted in strong results across our properties. We continue to monitor the effects of recent inflation and the possible implications on certain customers most affected by lower discretionary income. Although we have seen periods of reduced visitation from those customers, visitation from customers who are not as affected by inflation remains steady or has slightly improved. In addition, our leases with VICI are impacted by inflation as they are subject to annual escalators based on the Consumer Price Index (\u201cCPI\u201d).  We are also continuing to monitor rising interest rates which have a direct impact on certain of our debt instruments, in addition to an effect on consumer spending. We evaluate projected changes in interest rates when entering into borrowing arrangements and manage our mix of fixed versus variable debt. We continue to manage the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on the economy, our industry and our Company, with challenges arising at times from labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, increased costs of goods and services, among other impacts. Further discussion of the effects of these trends are described throughout this Form 10-K. The extent and duration of these trends is uncertain and may intensify. Online Betting and Gaming \u2014 Online betting and gaming is a rapidly developing sector of the e-commerce industry and we believe the digital segment of the global betting and gaming industry will continue to grow in popularity and consumer confidence. The market for online betting platforms is being driven by the increased use of digital processes and global, growing bettor demand. We anticipate that the United States market will begin to have a strong and steady uptake in active  Table of Contents6 Table of Contents6 Table of Contents 6   wagers as state-by-state legislation in the United States continues to evolve resulting in new opportunities in the United States sports betting market. The extent and future effects of online betting and gaming on our casino properties is uncertain but we expect that our online betting and gaming offering will be complementary to our brick-and-mortar casino business. Competition The casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition.\u00a0In most regions, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. In Las Vegas, our largest jurisdiction, competition is expected to increase in the coming years. In response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. There have also been proposals for other large scale gaming and non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers. Our Las Vegas Strip hotels and casinos also compete, in part, with each other.  In recent years, many casino operators, including us, have been reinvesting in existing facilities, developing or rebranding new casinos or complementary facilities, and acquiring established facilities.\u00a0These reinvestment and expansion efforts combined with aggressive marketing strategies by us and many of our competitors have resulted in increased competition in many regions. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has grown at a faster pace than demand in some areas. The expansion of properties and entertainment venues into new jurisdictions also presents competitive issues. Our properties also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands. While the competitive impact on operations in Las Vegas from the continued growth of Native American gaming establishments in California remains uncertain, the proliferation of gaming in California and other areas located in the same regions as our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes.\u00a0In addition, certain states have legalized, and others may legalize, casino gaming in specific areas, including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers. These factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment products that enable us to remain competitive. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming, such as state lotteries, on-track and off-track wagering, video lottery terminals, and card parlors. Our non-gaming offerings also compete with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues. Internet gaming and sports betting also create additional competition for our brick-and-mortar operations. We face significant competition in our online sports betting, online horse racing wagering and iGaming businesses in jurisdictions where we currently operate and those jurisdictions in which we wish to expand. Although we have experienced recent success in obtaining approval for sports betting and iGaming licenses in new jurisdictions, new state launches may require significant upfront investment and may not be successful.  Resources Material to Business  Rewards Programs We believe Caesars Rewards, with a network of more than 60 million people, enables us to compete more effectively and capture a larger share of our customers\u2019 entertainment spending when they travel among regions or engage in online wagering and gaming versus that of a standalone property, which is core to our cross-market strategy. Caesars Rewards members earn Reward Credits for qualifying gaming activities, including sports betting, online gaming and wagering in the Caesars Sportsbook and Caesars Racebook apps. Members also earn Reward Credits for qualifying hotel, dining and retail spending at all Caesars Entertainment destinations in the United States and Canada. Additionally, Reward Credits are earned when members use their Caesars Rewards VISA credit card or make a purchase through a Caesars Rewards partner. Members can redeem their earned Reward Credits for those same experiences.  Caesars Rewards is a tier based loyalty program (designated as Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Diamond Plus, Diamond Elite or Seven Stars), each with increasing benefits and privileges. Members are provided promotional offers based on their tier level, their retail and gaming engagement at Caesars Entertainment destinations, and their preferred spending choices outside of gaming. Member information is also used in connection with various marketing promotions, including campaigns involving direct mail, email, our websites, mobile devices, social media, and interactive slot machines. Table of Contents7 Table of Contents7 Table of Contents 7   Intellectual Property and Resources We use a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have the rights necessary to conduct our continuing operations. The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy. We regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. We file applications for and obtain patents, trademarks and copyrights in the United States and foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one patent, trademark, or copyright, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. Our United States patents have varying expiration dates.  We have not applied for the registration of all of our trademarks, copyrights, proprietary technology, or other intellectual property rights, as the case may be, and may not be successful in obtaining all intellectual property rights for which we have applied. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe upon our intellectual property and use information that we regard as proprietary, and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great of an extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. We own or have the right to use proprietary rights to a number of trademarks that we consider, along with the associated name recognition, to be valuable to our business, including Eldorado, Silver Legacy, Isle, Lady Luck, Tropicana, Circus Circus, Caesars, Flamingo, Harrah\u2019s, Horseshoe, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Caesars Rewards, Caesars Sportsbook, William Hill and WSOP. As of December\u00a031, 2022, our Caesars Sportsbook app is powered by our Liberty platform in 20 mobile sports betting jurisdictions. The Liberty platform resulted in a significant upgrade to our user interface and significant product upgrades including numerous pre-match and live markets, extensive odds and flexible limits, player props, and same-game parlays. Our Liberty platform also integrates customers with the Caesars Rewards loyalty program. We continue to use legacy sportsbook and iGaming platforms in certain states. In addition to the Caesars Sportsbook app, we and NYRABets LLC, the official online wagering platform of the New York Racing Association, Inc., launched the Caesars Racebook app. The Caesars Racebook app provides access for pari-mutuel wagering at over 300 racetracks around the world. Wagers placed can earn credits towards the Caesars Rewards loyalty program. Industry Overview See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d See also Exhibit 99.1, \u201cGaming Overview,\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.  Seasonality We believe that business at our regional properties outside of Las Vegas is subject to seasonality, including seasonality based on the weather in the region in which they operate and the travel habits of visitors. Business in our properties can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events, particularly when a holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year, the timing of the WSOP tournament (with respect to our Las Vegas properties), city-wide conventions, large sporting events or concerts, or visits by our premium players. We also believe that any seasonality, holiday, or other significant event may affect our various properties or regions differently. We may also experience seasonality with retail and online sports betting which coincides with certain sporting events, as well as seasons of professional sports teams. Gaming Licenses and Governmental Regulations The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and characters of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in legislatures of jurisdictions in which we have operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or when such legislation will be enacted. Gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us. Table of Contents8 Table of Contents8 Table of Contents 8   Some jurisdictions, including those in which we are licensed, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. Under provisions of gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations, and under our organizational documents, certain of our securities are subject to restriction on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities. The restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities or, if the holder refuses, or is unable to dispose of the securities, we may be required to repurchase the securities. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit\u00a099.1 to this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Internal Revenue Service Regulations The Internal Revenue Service requires operators of casinos and online sports betting apps located in the United States to file information returns for U.S. citizens, including names and addresses of winners for certain table games, keno, bingo, slot machine and retail and online sports betting winnings in excess of stipulated amounts. The Internal Revenue Service also requires operators to withhold taxes on some table games, keno, bingo, slot machine and retail and online sports betting winnings of nonresident aliens. We are unable to predict the extent to which these requirements, if extended, might impede or otherwise adversely affect operations of, and/or income from, other games. Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (\u201cFINCEN\u201d) requires the reporting of currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. This reporting obligation began in May 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the United States which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations. In addition to currency transaction reporting requirements, suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to FINCEN.  Other Laws and Regulations Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. The sale of alcoholic beverages is subject to licensing, control and regulation by applicable local regulatory agencies. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon our operations. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d for additional discussion. Taxation Gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to air quality, indoor air quality, water quality, bulk storage of regulated materials, and disposal of waste, including hazardous waste. Such laws and regulations can impose liability on potentially responsible parties (owner/operators of real property) to clean up, or contribute to the cost of cleaning up, sites at which regulated materials were disposed of or released. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws and regulations, we could face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance, contamination or exposure to hazardous conditions. Environmental regulatory violations also include monetary penalties assessed by the  Table of Contents9 Table of Contents9 Table of Contents 9   jurisdictional regulatory agency and civil or criminal penalties for intentional negligence. Occasionally and under certain circumstances, we have investigated and remediated (or contributed to remediation costs) contamination located at or near our facilities. Examples included contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain facilities are located. In addition, we have and continue to contain, manage, and dispose of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations; manage, abate, or remove indoor air quality concerns such as mold, lead, or asbestos-containing materials; and manage operations within applicable environmental permitting requirements. Although we have incurred and expect to incur costs related to various environmental matters such as investigations, remediation, and management of hazardous materials or conditions known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, such matters in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business. Climate Change There has been an increasing focus of international, national, state, regional and local regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d), including carbon emissions, and climate change issues. The United States is a member of the Paris Agreement, a climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (\u201cCOP 21\u201d) in Paris, that set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. The Paris Agreement requires set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Stronger GHG emission targets were set at COP 26 in Glasgow in November 2021. Future regulation could impose stringent standards to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress. The current Administration has taken steps to further regulate GHG emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement or estimate. Beyond financial and regulatory effects, the projected severe effects of climate change \u2013 such as property damage or supply chain issues stemming from extreme weather events \u2013 has already and may continue to directly affect our facilities and operations. Caesars recognizes the impacts of climate change and is engaged in long-term initiatives to identify, assess, and manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change (see \u201cEnvironmental Stewardship\u201d below). Reporting and Record-Keeping Requirements We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us and our subsidiaries that gaming authorities may require. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may, and in certain jurisdictions do, require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws. Human Capital Management We aim to provide a workplace that is engaging, empowering, inclusive and respectful for all employees (our \u201cTeam Members\u201d), embracing a culture of openness, passion for service and recognition. Our ongoing investment in professional training and development, safety, health and wellbeing, and Team Member recognition linked to guest satisfaction are all important drivers of our success in delivering strong financial results and creating value for our communities. We have approximately 49,000 employees at our domestic properties throughout our organization. Labor Relations Approximately 21,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain of our subsidiaries. The majority of these employees in various job positions are covered by the following agreements: Employee GroupApproximate Number of Active Employees RepresentedUnionDate on which Collective Bargaining Agreement Becomes AmendableLas Vegas Culinary Employees10,000Culinary Workers Union, Local 226May 31, 2023Atlantic City Food & Beverage and Hotel Employees2,700UNITE HERE, Local 54May 31, 2026Las Vegas Dealers2,000United Auto WorkersSeptember 30, 2023Las Vegas Teamsters1,200Teamsters, Local 986March 31, 2024Las Vegas Bartenders1,100Bartenders Union, Local 165May 31, 2023 Table of Contents10 Table of Contents10 Table of Contents 10   Hiring and Development We aim to support Team Members throughout their career with Caesars. We\u2019re committed to providing opportunities to help Team Members achieve their professional goals. We maintain a wide range of channels for diverse recruiting, including outreach to academic institutions and nonprofits that help us source diverse candidates. Our leadership receives training on our inclusive and equitable talent management recruitment and retention processes. Additionally, to support hiring initiatives across the enterprise, we maintain a recruiting website that includes information describing our culture, benefits and diversity initiatives. The website highlights our commitment to corporate social responsibility (\u201cCSR\u201d) diversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d), and we welcome candidates from all backgrounds. We strive to inspire our Team Members through our mission, vision and values, and our Code of Commitment (described below). To evaluate our Team Member experience and our retention efforts, we monitor a number of Team Member measures, such as turnover rates and Team Member satisfaction. In 2021, we implemented new Team Member experience surveys to help us further understand the drivers of engagement and areas where we can improve. These surveys are completed on a regular basis alongside additional surveys targeted at specific events within a Team Member cycle, including new hires, anniversary milestones and exit inquiries. Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate our Team Members. In addition to competitive salaries and wages, we provide a variety of short-term, long-term and incentive-based compensation programs to reward performance relative to key metrics relevant to our business. We offer comprehensive benefit options including, but not limited to, retirement savings plans, health insurance coverage (including medical, mental health, dental, vision and pharmacy), parental leave, educational assistance, training opportunities, company-paid life insurance and an employee assistance program.  We place utmost importance on creating a safe workplace for our Team Members, embedding procedures so that all our Team Members have the awareness, knowledge and tools to make safe working a habit. We also maintain a wellness program to help our Team Members improve their health and wellbeing. This program has demonstrated improved health metrics for participating Team Members and their covered family members helping reduce the cost of healthcare for Team Members and for the Company. Effective in 2022, we consolidated our group health plans and made significant enhancements to our offerings and wellness program including a wide range of affordable options, mental health initiatives and expanded onsite and virtual primary care clinics across the US. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion We embrace diversity and aim to create an inclusive working environment that celebrates all our Team Members as individuals. Our diversity, equity and inclusion framework identifies five pillars of activity: advocacy, Team Members, suppliers, communities and guests for a holistic approach to embedding DEI in everything we do. We publish our DEI data in our annual CSR report (described below).  We set targets to increase the representation of women and people of color in leadership roles (supervisory and above). Our 2025 goals outlined 50% of management roles to be held by women in both the mid-level and senior leadership populations, and 50% of leadership roles to be held by people of color. We also committed to increase the representation of people of color in senior leadership roles by 50%. As of year-end, 45% of mid-level roles and 30% of senior leadership roles in the Company are held by women. Additionally, 43% of leadership roles are held by people of color and the representation of people of color in senior leadership positions has increased by 106%. Corporate Social Responsibility Caesars\u2019 Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and senior executives view CSR as an integral element in the way we do business, with the belief that being a good corporate citizen helps protect the Company against risk, contributes to improved performance and helps foster positive relationships with all those with whom we connect. The Board and our executive management are committed to being an industry leader in CSR (which includes diversity, equity and inclusion, social impact, and environmental sustainability). In 2022, the Board and our leadership continued to engage with our CEO-level external CSR Advisory Board comprised of experts representing DEI, business strategy, academia and investors, and used their guidance to confirm our CSR priorities. These priorities are reflected in our 13th annual CSR report, published in 2022 in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative Standards. CSR Committee of the Board  Caesars\u2019 Board has a CSR committee that defines the duties and responsibilities of the Board in supporting delivery of our corporate purpose and CSR strategy as well as CSR-related aspects of corporate governance such as Board diversity. Table of Contents11 Table of Contents11 Table of Contents 11   Code of Commitment Caesars is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and environmental steward through our CSR strategy, PEOPLE PLANET PLAY. This is reflected in our Code of Commitment which is our public pledge to our guests, Team Members, communities, business partners and all those we reach that we will honor the trust they have placed in us through ethical conduct and integrity. We commit to: \u2022PEOPLE: Supporting the wellbeing of our Team Members, guests and local communities. \u2022PLANET: Taking care of the world we all call home. \u2022PLAY: Creating memorable experiences for our guests and leading responsible gaming practices in the industry. PEOPLE PLANET PLAY Strategy Our PEOPLE PLANET PLAY strategy defines how we meet the obligations of our Code of Commitment and is aligned with global priorities articulated by the United Nations as the Sustainable Development Goals. PEOPLE PLANET PLAY establishes multi-year targets in key areas of impact, including science-based greenhouse gas emissions-reduction, formally approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (\u201cSBTi\u201d), aligning with global best practices on climate change action. In early 2022, we conducted a comprehensive CSR assessment to evaluate our assumptions. We also used the assessment period to review our business transformations following the COVID-19 pandemic, along with expectations related to social justice and CSR. With the help of an external specialist, our assessment gathered input from internal and external stakeholders, reviewed multiple industry and environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) disclosures, standards and frameworks and yielded 21 material topics. This process allowed us to reassess the role our business plays in society, the way we impact people and the environment and the needs of our stakeholders. Our materiality assessment is available on our website at www.investor.caesars.com within the ESG resource hub on our Corporate Social Responsibility page. Responsible Gaming For more than thirty years, Caesars has maintained its Responsible Gaming (\u201cRG\u201d) program. We train tens of thousands of Team Members each year and a cadre of RG Ambassadors throughout our properties to identify guests in need of assistance and provide support. In recent years, Caesars has contributed to the National Center for Responsible Gaming, the National Council on Problem Gaming and other state programs to help advance responsible practices in the gaming industry. Caesars Digital also maintains responsible gaming programs tailored to each state in which it operates and offers users in-application RG tools such as time on device restrictions and wagering limits. Caesars maintains a comprehensive risk-based Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) and Anti-Money Laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) program. It includes strong governance and effective internal controls and procedures to comply with applicable BSA requirements, regulatory guidance, and any related laws, and to take measures to prevent its affiliated casinos from being used for money laundering or other criminal activity. Execution of the program is governed with reference to FINCEN\u2019s guidance on the Culture of Compliance. Caesars\u2019 internal AML Policy, Know Your Customer Policy and BSA Identification Policy outline the Caesars AML Program and set the minimum standards for the related procedures and internal controls of the Caesars casino affiliates. Employees are required to complete annual trainings related company policies, including AML. Caesars also maintains a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the \u201cCode\u201d) that includes standards designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote, amongst other standards, honest and ethical conduct and full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Caesars\u2019 Chief Legal Officer serves as the compliance officer of the Code and Caesars provides periodic training regarding the contents and importance of the Code. Caesars also maintains an Amended and Restated Gaming Compliance Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), which is approved by various gaming regulators. The Plan is designed to implement procedures to enhance the likelihood that no activities of the Company or any affiliate of the Company will impugn the reputation and integrity of Caesars. The Plan also establishes a Compliance Committee that assists the Company in implementing its strict policy that its business be conducted with honesty and integrity, and in accordance with high moral, legal and ethical standards. Caesars\u2019 Senior Vice President & Assistant General Counsel \u2013 Regulatory & Compliance serves as the Compliance Officer as defined by the Plan. Table of Contents12 Table of Contents12 Table of Contents 12   Environmental Stewardship We take a proactive approach to environmental sustainability through our CodeGreen strategy established in 2007, striving to improve our performance across energy and GHG emissions efficiencies, reduction of water consumption and increasing diversion of waste from landfills. Caesars recognizes the impact climate change can play both on our business and the guests we serve. Identifying, assessing, and managing the risks and opportunities therefore plays a vital role in our long-term strategic thinking on climate and water, and how we approach our CSR goals. We adopted Science Based Targets (\u201cSBTs\u201d) as part of our strategy to reduce our environmental impact. These targets, approved to be in line with well below 2 degrees Celsius per SBTi, are (i) reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 35% by 2025, and 100% by 2050, from a 2011 base-year and (ii) having 60% of suppliers by spend institute science-based GHG reduction targets for their operations by 2023. In 2023, we expect to establish a new baseline to reaffirm GHG emission reduction goals as a combined company, while increasing our ambition to meet a 1.5-degree reduction target. We modeled our GHG emissions data to create an estimate for 2018 and prior years back to 2011. This enabled us to compare our progress against our SBTs using actual data against a modeled 2011 base year. Between 2011 and 2021, Caesars estimated a reduction in absolute Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions of 33.9%. Caesars is pursuing renewable energy sources and low-carbon options, including on site solar developments. Our long-term goals include a continued focus on energy efficiency and conservation as well as evaluating renewable energy supply opportunities for each of our properties in pursuit of our forthcoming SBTs. We voluntarily participate in the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), an international nonprofit that runs a global disclosure system for investors, companies, and regions to manage their environmental impacts. In 2022, Caesars achieved A-List status for both climate change and water security and in 2021 earned a spot on the Supplier Engagement Leaderboard from CDP. Less than 3% of companies assessed by CDP in 2022 made the A List for either climate change or water security. We are engaged in extensive waste reduction efforts across our facilities, including recycling, food donation, and manure composting. In 2021, we diverted 40% of our total waste from landfills. Community Investment Caesars contributes to our local communities to help them develop and prosper, through funding community projects, Team Member volunteering and cash donations from the Caesars Foundation, a private foundation funded from our operating income. In 2022, the Caesars Foundation contributed $3.3\u00a0million to communities across the United States. The Caesars Foundation also continued to support significant national relationships that support diversity, equity and inclusion. During 2022, our Team Members volunteered over 75,000 hours through the HERO program. Many of our community partners are long-term collaborations. For example, in 2022 we celebrated the 20th anniversary of our partnership with Meal on Wheels America working together to combat the issues of senior hunger and isolation. We also implemented an expanded partnership with Boys and Girls Club of America supported by a $500,000 grant from the Caesars Foundation to support the mission of enabling young people to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. We seek to encourage DEI dialogue in our communities as part of our advocacy approach to raise awareness. In 2022, we hosted a DEI Summit bringing together corporate and nonprofit partners and suppliers in supporting and promoting efforts to advance DEI initiatives. The Summit included several educational sessions, keynotes and panel discussions led by notable DEI leaders and practitioners, as well as a panel discussion involving diverse suppliers.
