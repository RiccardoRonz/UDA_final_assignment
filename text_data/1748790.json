{"cik": 1748790, "item_1A": "Item 1. - Business  The Company    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey. Our history dates back more than 150 years, with origins in both Australia and the USA. Today, we are a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other products. Our innovation excellence and global packaging expertise enables us to solve packaging challenges around the world every day, producing packaging that is more functional, appealing, and cost effective for our customers and their consumers and importantly, more sustainable for the environment.  Sustainability \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sustainability is central to our business and one of our most exciting opportunities for growth. Working daily to embed sustainability deeper into everything we do, Amcor has been a leader in the industry in promoting sustainability. We aspire to improve the quality of lives, protect ecosystems, and preserve natural resources for future generations by offering a unique range of responsible packaging solutions, leveraging our global scale, reach, and expertise to meet our customers\u2019 growing sustainability expectations. In January 2018, we became the world\u2019s first packaging company to pledge that all our packaging would be designed to be recycled, compostable, or reusable by 2025 and also committed to increasing the amount of recycled content we use. We are delivering against these commitments and continue to lead in the development of a responsible packaging value chain through our innovations and partnerships. We have identified a clear path to meeting our sustainability ambitions and those of our customers by focusing on the three elements of responsible packaging \u2013 product innovation, consumer participation, and infrastructure development.  Differentiated Solutions \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our product portfolio is diverse and dynamic due to our constant innovation and close partnerships with our customers. Behind every one of our products stands a unique combination of technical know-how, business experience, and expertise. We work closely with our customers to identify feasible, high-performance, responsible packaging solutions based on their unique needs. Where solutions do not currently exist, we work to innovate new ones. We invest approximately $100 million every year in our industry-leading research and development capabilities, bringing together the best in packaging design, science, manufacturing, and people.   Expertise across Packaging Materials  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We believe that we are uniquely positioned to offer a variety of packaging solutions with a wide, differentiated portfolio of products. Our packaging expertise covers all main packaging materials including paper, metal, plastic, recycled, and bio-based materials and the sustainable use of recyclable plastics. Our expertise and track record translate across many innovative solutions that customers can explore with ease and convenience to meet their growing packaging needs, while improving environmental impact.  Business Strategy  Strategy \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our business strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differentiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company. To fulfill our aspiration, we are determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders, and the environment.  Focused portfolio \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our portfolio of businesses share certain important characteristics:  \u2022A focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods, \u2022good industry structure, \u2022attractive relative growth, and \u2022multiple paths for us to win through our leadership position, scale, and ability to differentiate our product offering through innovation.  5 5 5   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closures.  Differentiated capabilities \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The Amcor Way\" describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent, Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership, Innovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline. Our values of Safety, Integrity, Collaboration, Accountability, and Results and Outperformance guide our behavior, driving our winning aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company.  Shareholder value creation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through our portfolio of focused businesses and differentiated capabilities, we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior value for shareholders. The nature of our consumer and healthcare end markets means that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time, value creation has been strong and consistent and has reflected a combination of dividends, organic growth in the base business, and using free cash flow to pursue targeted acquisitions and/or returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks. 6 6 6   Segment Information  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 280, \"Segment Reporting,\" establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, we have determined we have two reportable segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reportable segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to Note 21, \"Segments,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reportable segments.  Flexibles Segment  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 35,000 employees at 166 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 37 countries as of June 30, 2023, the Flexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic, aluminum, and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2023, Flexibles accounted for approximately 76% of consolidated net sales.  Rigid Packaging Segment  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Rigid Packaging Segment manufactures rigid packaging containers and related products in the Americas. As of June 30, 2023, the Rigid Packaging Segment employed approximately 5,000 employees at 52 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 11 countries. In fiscal year 2023, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 24% of consolidated net sales.  Marketing, Distribution, and Competition  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but primarily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, field service technicians, and customer service teams.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales in the last three fiscal years.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, sustainability, innovation, quality, and price. Competitors include AptarGroup, Inc., Ball Corporation, Berry Global Group, Inc, CCL Industries Inc., Crown Holdings, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company, Huhtamaki Oyj, International Paper Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, O-I Glass, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., Sonoco Products Company, and WestRock Company, and a variety of privately held companies.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we operate; however, due to the diversity of our business, our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable.   Backlog  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the markets in which we operate.  Raw Materials  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, solvents, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources, and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While we have experienced industry-wide shortages of certain raw materials in the past, we have been able to manage supply disruptions by working closely with our suppliers and customers. Supply shortages, along with other factors, can lead and have in the past led to increased raw material price volatility. Increases in the price of raw materials are generally able to be passed on to customers through contractual price mechanisms over time and other means. We manage the risks associated with our supply chain and have generally been able to maintain adequate raw materials through relationship management, inventory management and evaluation of alternative sources when practical. For more information, see \"Item 1A.  7 7 7   - Raw Materials \u2014 Price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials, energy and other inputs could adversely affect our business.\u201d  8 8 8   Intellectual Property  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are the owner or licensee of more than a thousand United States and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. We have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our reportable segments. Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms, or otherwise.  Sustainability and Innovation  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sustainability is comprehensively embedded across our business, from the investments we are making in packaging innovation and design, to our global collaboration strategy, to the work we undertake within our own operations and with our upstream and downstream partners to develop a more responsible packaging value chain.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We believe there will always be a role for the primary packaging we produce to preserve food, beverages, and healthcare products, protect consumers, and promote brands. Consumers also want cost effective, convenient, and easy to use packaging with a reduced environmental footprint and a responsible end of life solution. We have identified a clear path to provide food, beverages, and healthcare products to people around the world in a more sustainable way and meet our sustainability ambitions and those of our customers, by focusing on three key elements of responsible packaging: product innovation, consumer participation, and waste management infrastructure. We believe our commitment to responsible packaging is integral to our success. Our responsible packaging solutions address both how the product is made, as well as what happens after the consumer uses it, offering a wide variety of options to advance sustainability while meeting our customers\u2019 specific packaging needs.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Innovation is central to Amcor\u2019s approach to sustainability and we spend approximately $100 million a year on research and development (\"R&D\"), not including ongoing investment in incremental continuous improvements. We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and have more than 1,000 active patents, as well as a global network of Innovation Centers focused on bringing advanced packaging technologies and more sustainable material science to our markets around the world. We solve packaging challenges, developing differentiated products, services, and processes to protect our customers' products and fulfil the needs of the consumers who rely on them. Drawing on unrivaled heritage in design, science, and manufacturing, our more than 1,000 R&D professionals and engineers are constantly innovating across new materials, formats, functions, and technologies.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We collaborate with like-minded partners, including customers and suppliers, in pursuit of innovative solutions to address some of the world\u2019s most urgent challenges, including increasing recycling and reuse and reducing our environmental impacts. We also partner with non-governmental organizations, promising startups, and cross-industry initiatives and bodies. These partnerships enable us to learn, experience other perspectives, share our expertise, and expand our innovation. With our partners, we advocate for sound global design standards, better waste management infrastructure, and higher levels of consumer participation in recycling that will be required to develop a true circular economy for packaging.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We believe that our environmental footprint goes well beyond the products we create. We also strive to continuously reduce the environmental impacts of our operations. For more than a decade, our EnviroAction program has helped us significantly improve how we manage energy, water, and waste in every one of our manufacturing locations. In January 2022, we further increased our efforts by committing to set science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. These new commitments have been recognized by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and build on years of progress under our EnviroAction program. In June 2023, we took the next step forward in our science-based targets journey by submitting our proposed targets to the SBTi for review.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With our global scale, deep industry experience, and strong capabilities, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the design and development of more sustainable packaging, and this is one of the most important growth opportunities for Amcor.  Governmental Laws and Regulations  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our operations and the real property we own, or lease, are subject to broad governmental laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations pertain to employee health  9 9 9   and safety, the discharge of certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, other rules to control pollution and manage natural resources, and other government regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable health and safety laws, environmental laws and regulations based on the execution of our Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System and regular audits of those processes and systems. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not, in the future, incur liability with respect to noncompliance with health and safety laws, environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, or other broad government regulations which could be significant. In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we cannot always anticipate these changes. Refer to Note 20, \"Contingencies and Legal Proceedings,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see \"Item 1A. - Risk Factors.\"  Seasonal Factors   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our business and operations of each of the reportable segments is not seasonal to any material extent.  Historically, cash flow from operations has been lower in the first half of the fiscal year, and higher in the second half of the fiscal year, due to working capital management and the timing of certain cash payments made in the first half of the year, including incentive compensation.   Research and Development  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Refer to section \"Sustainability and Innovation\" within \"Item 1. - Business\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and to Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements, for further information about our research and development activities, expenditures, and policies.   10 10 10   Human Capital Management  Overview  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amcor\u2019s aspiration is to be \u2018THE leading global packaging company'. Our people are core to the achievement of our aspiration. We believe we are winning for our people when they feel safe, engaged, and are developing as part of a high-performing, global team. We strive to build an outperformance culture in which we consistently deliver results and strive to surpass expectations. At Amcor, we are stronger because of the diverse strengths, styles, cultures, and experiences of our people. We aim to create inclusive working environments to ensure each colleague feels valued, treated with respect, encouraged to speak, and empowered to be their best.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of June 30, 2023, we had approximately 41,000 employees, including part-time and temporary workers, worldwide, with approximately 30% located in North America, 30% located in Europe, 20% located in Latin America, and 20% located in the Asia Pacific region. Collective bargaining agreements cover approximately 45% of our workforce. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 3% of our employees were working under expired contracts and approximately 17% were covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire within one year.   Health and Safety  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Safety is a core value at Amcor. We take care of ourselves and each other, so everyone returns home safely every day. Across every level of our organization, we role model and recognize safe and responsible behavior as we strive to achieve an injury-free Amcor. All our facilities abide by global Environment, Health, and Safety (\"EHS\") standards for safety and environmental management. Our Board of Directors receives monthly reports on safety performance and compliance with our global EHS standards. During fiscal year 2023, we reduced the number of injuries by 31% and 69% of our sites were injury free.   Developing Talent  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Amcor, we are dedicated to attracting, developing, engaging, and retaining the best talent to deliver our 'Winning Aspiration' and ensure a strong succession pipeline for the future. Our fiscal years 2023-2027 Human Capital Strategy is focused on ensuring that we have the right people in the right jobs at the right time to drive our growth agenda.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our approach to talent is guided by the understanding that by creating a truly differentiated, industry-leading pool of talent which can be deployed consistently across our business, we will better enable Amcor\u2019s success. Amcor is dedicated to attracting, developing, engaging, and retaining the best talent and strengthening our succession pipeline for the future. We have a range of executive development, leadership training, education, and awareness programs to help employees progress across all functions and experience levels.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We deploy systems and processes to ensure our people have clear goals and are empowered to achieve them. Through performance management, we align these goals to business targets, providing line of sight so each employee understands how they contribute to our success. Through formal reviews, performance coaching, and feedback, our leaders implement a rigorous cycle to foster talent.  Learning & Development  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have implemented training and education programs to help our employees progress across functions and experience levels. Examples of these programs include a Leading to Outperform program (\"LTO\") to further advance high-potential talent, a Senior Leader Development program (\"SLDP\") focusing on developing strategic management skills and inclusive leadership.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fiscal year 2023, we introduced a new aspect to our Executive Development program (\"EDP\"). This annual program targets our most senior leaders and provides them an immersive experience in Strategy Development and leading Talent. For fiscal year 2023, we selected a handful of the organization's most high potential leaders and kicked off our EDP 2.0 experience where we seek to expand the participants' capabilities. In each of these programs, we partner with leading academic and executive education institutions from around the world.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognizing the importance of the learning journey, our employees can also access our \"Masterclass\" program which delivers an annual series of executive education briefings on topics of functional excellence and business initiatives. Our focus  11 11 11   this year has been on Accelerating Growth with showcase presentations from Marketing, R&D, Product Branding, and Innovation Leaders.  Diversity, Equity & Inclusion  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Amcor, we\u2019re committed to providing an inclusive environment that empowers us to achieve our full potential. Becoming THE leading global packaging company requires us to create a culture in which everyone feels encouraged to speak and compelled to listen.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amcor values the diverse experience, strengths, styles, nationalities, and cultures of all our people. Our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy is focused on three main areas: (1) building awareness through training and education to help our leaders be more inclusive, (2) diversifying our global talent pool by removing bias from talent attraction and development, and (3) by sharing best practices and learning across the organization.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amcor believes that with different perspectives come different solutions that enable us to win for our stakeholders. We are one global team in which everyone has a voice and can make a difference. With this in mind, we work to create a team environment that develops inclusive leaders, where we learn from our people, and where listening, trust, and respect are key behaviors that form the foundation of our interactions and foster mutual understanding.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We focus on strengthening 'talent through diversity' and progress is reported to our Board annually. We continually review opportunities to strengthen our diversity transparency practices while adhering to privacy legislation in certain regions where we operate. The Board receives an annual report on our progress towards its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.  Engagement  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Amcor, we believe strongly in Engagement being a key driver of performance and so we track the engagement of our employees in every region and across multiple dimensions, including against other global manufacturing companies through engagement surveys. Our engagement surveys provide employees with an opportunity to share anonymous and confidential feedback on a variety of topics and provide management with insight on areas we can focus on to improve our employees' experience and effect positive change.  Ethics  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good corporate governance and transparency are fundamental to achieving our aspirations. Our employees are expected to act with integrity and objectivity and to always strive to enhance our reputation and performance.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy which is signed by every Amcor employee and provides our framework for making ethical business decisions. We provide targeted training across the globe to reinforce our commitment to ethics and drive adherence to the national laws in each country in which we operate.   12 12 12   Information about our Executive Officers   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following sets forth the name, age, and business experience for at least the last five years of our executive officers.
