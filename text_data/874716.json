Our Purpose is to be a great company that creates exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees, and stockholders by enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT  We operate primarily through three business segments: Companion Animal Group, Water quality products, and Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. Our Other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic products and services business with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.  Companion Animal Group (\u201cCAG\u201d) - Diagnostic and information management-based products and services for the companion animal veterinary industry, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions, outside reference laboratory services, and veterinary software and services.  CAG Diagnostics   We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians\u2019 diverse needs through a variety of modalities, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. Regardless of modality utilized, veterinarians are provided with clinically relevant data which is integrated within our information management technologies. The result is a comprehensive view of patient diagnostic information that is easily accessible by both the veterinarian and pet owner.  Integrated Diagnostic Information Management. VetConnect PLUS is a cloud-based technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients\u2019 data from all of IDEXX\u2019s diagnostic modalities. These integrated diagnostic results provide the veterinarian with a visualization of patient-specific testing results, allowing the veterinarian to easily see and trend diagnostic results, enabling greater medical insight and enhanced decision-making. In addition, VetConnect PLUS provides instant mobile or browser-based access to results, which can be printed or emailed to pet owners and other veterinarians.  In-Clinic Diagnostic Solutions. Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions are comprised of our IDEXX VetLab suite of in-clinic chemistry, hematology, immunoassay, urinalysis, and coagulation analyzers, as well as associated consumable products that provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results. Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions also include a broad range of single-use, IDEXX SNAP\u00a0rapid assay test kits that provide quick, accurate, and convenient point-of-care diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal disease causing pathogens and health conditions. Additionally, we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Blood and Urine Chemistry. We have three blood and urine chemistry analyzers that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting  6 6 6   in diagnosing physiologic conditions. We actively sell the Catalyst One Chemistry analyzer. We continue to support our Catalyst Dx and VetTest Chemistry analyzers.\u00a0We also support the VetStat Electrolyte and Blood Gas analyzer. Sales of consumables to customers who use our chemistry analyzers provide the majority of our instrument consumables revenues from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab instruments.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hematology. We sell three hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (also called a complete blood count). These analyzers include the ProCyte One and ProCyte\u00a0Dx hematology\u00a0analyzers. We also sell the Coag Dx analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders. While we currently do not sell the LaserCyte Dx hematology\u00a0analyzer and the IDEXX VetAutoread hematology\u00a0analyzer, we continue to support these analyzers.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rapid Assay. The SNAP rapid assays are single-use, handheld test kits that can work without the use of instrumentation, although many kits may also be activated with results automatically captured and interpreted by the SNAP Pro Analyzer. This device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results with the pet owner on the SNAP Pro Analyzer screen, or via VetConnect PLUS. Our SNAPshot Dx analyzer can run multiple patient samples at once. The principal canine SNAP rapid assay tests include SNAP 4Dx Plus, which tests for the six vector-borne diseases causing pathogens, including Lyme disease as well as canine heartworm, and SNAP Heartworm RT, which tests for heartworm. Sales of our canine vector-borne disease tests are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practices in the Northern\u00a0Hemisphere. The principal feline SNAP rapid assay tests include SNAP Feline Triple, which tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (\u201cFIV\u201d) (which is similar to the virus that leads to AIDS in humans), feline leukemia virus\u00a0(\u201cFeLV\u201d) and heartworm, and SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test, which tests for FIV and FeLV.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Urinalysis. The SediVue Dx analyzer is designed to provide automated real-time results in a fraction of the time of manual microscope analysis, which allows veterinary staff to perform a urine sediment analysis in approximately 3 minutes. The IDEXX VetLab UA analyzer provides rapid, automated capture of semi-quantitative chemical urinalysis from IDEXX UA strips and is validated specifically for veterinary use.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IDEXX VetLab Station. The IDEXX VetLab Station (\u201cIVLS\u201d) connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the IDEXX VetLab analyzers, and thus, provides reference laboratory information management system capability. IVLS also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to VetConnect PLUS. We sell IVLS as an integral component for our in-clinic analyzer suite.

Water testing. Our principal products are the Colilert, Colilert-18, and Colisure tests, which detect the presence of total coliforms and E. coli in water. These organisms are broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. Our products utilize nutrient-indicators that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities, and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, wastewater, and water from private wells. We also sell consumables, parts, and accessories to be used with many of our water testing products. During the third quarter of  8 8 8   2022, we acquired TECTA-PDS, a Canadian-based water testing company with customers in more than 50 countries. Through this acquisition, we are able to provide an automated rapid microbiology monitoring system to detect total coliforms and E. coli or enterococci in water. The TECTA-PDS test has also been approved by the EPA for detecting total coliforms and E. coli for drinking water compliance testing. IDEXX also offers the following products:   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enterolert. Our Enterolert products detect the presence of enterococci in drinking, waste, and recreational waters. Enterococci, bacteria normally found in human and animal waste, are organisms broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pseudalert. Our Pseudalert products detect the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pool, spa, and bottled water. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen that can cause \u201chot-tub rash,\u201d \u201cswimmer\u2019s ear,\u201d and potentially fatal infections in individuals with weakened immune systems.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filta-Max and Filta-Max\u00a0xpress. Our Filta-Max and Filta-Max\u00a0xpress products are used in the detection of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in water.

PATENTS AND LICENSES  We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third parties. Patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties are considered important to us based on a variety of factors, including providing protection for our inventions and other intellectual property; affording protection from competitors in certain sectors; enabling the use of more effective and efficient technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings; strengthening our reputation and standing among customers, employees, and key suppliers; and acting as a deterrent against counterfeiters, imitators, and other copiers of technologies.\u00a0  Important patents and licenses include those related to: \u2022Catalyst\u00a0consumables that began to expire in 2020 and will continue into 2035; \u2022Catalyst instruments that expire beginning in 2026 and will continue into 2032; \u2022Reagents and methods for the detection of canine pancreatic lipase that expire in 2026; and \u2022Patents relating to reagents and methods for the detection of SDMA that expire beginning in 2029 and will continue into 2037.  10 10 10   While we consider these technology rights to be important to us, a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position. These factors include publications, including peer-reviewed third-party studies, that demonstrate the accuracy of our products; our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace; the breadth, quality and integration of our product offerings; our existing customer relationships and our customer support; our sales force; our online ordering platform that enables direct ordering of (including establishing automatic reorder schedules for) our consumables, tests and other products by our customers; the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies and/or additional patents; our investment in diagnostic innovations that results in new product offerings that often are patentable and that expand the test menu for our in-clinic instruments and/or reference laboratory business;\u00a0and our significant know-how, scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments. Although we have certain patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that are expected to expire in future years, the expiration of these patents and licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations. In addition, we already face robust competition as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market, despite the protections afforded by these technology rights.  To the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights, or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. Refer to \u201cPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d  PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY  Many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties.\u00a0We rely on third parties in our supply chain to supply us, and our direct suppliers, with certain important components, raw materials, and consumables used in or with our products. In some cases, these third parties are sole or single-source suppliers. From time to time, we seek to qualify alternative suppliers.  Instruments and consumables. Significant products supplied by sole and single-source providers include certain Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One\u00a0consumables (other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine, T4, CRP, progesterone, and SDMA, and Bile Acid slides), VetTest slides, VetLyte consumables, LaserCyte Dx consumables, VetAutoread and ProCyte Dx analyzers and consumables, SediVue Dx urinalysis instruments and consumables, and certain components of our internally manufactured analyzers.  Certain Catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by Ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire in December of 2031. We are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of Catalyst chemistry slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements. The agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment. The agreements also prohibit Ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary sector, excluding the EU, other than to IDEXX.\u00a0  We purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2034, which in some cases may be extended at our option. We have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements, and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements. Refer to \u201cPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d  Other components. We purchase certain other products, raw materials, and components from sole and single-source suppliers. These products include certain diagnostic\u00a0imaging systems and certain components used in our SNAP rapid assay and dairy devices, livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products.  We have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single-source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products. Refer to \u201cPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d  Product quality and safety. We believe that product quality and safety are essential to our business.

We compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory Company, Abbott Diagnostics, a division of Abbott Laboratories and Roche Diagnostics Corporation.  GOVERNMENT REGULATION  Many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, product registrations, manufacturing, import, export, distribution, marketing and promotion, labeling, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage, product disposal, environmental compliance, and workplace safety. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.  Veterinary diagnostic products. Our veterinary diagnostic products including instruments, such as Catalyst One and ProCyte One, as well as their corresponding consumables, are veterinary medical devices regulated by the FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the \u201cFDC Act\u201d). Other FDA regulated products include our rapid assay products such as SNAP devices and ELISA plates. While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to FDA inspections or the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (\u201ccGMP\u201d), the FDA Act specifies that these products must not be adulterated, mislabeled, or misbranded.  A subset of our veterinary diagnostic products, including our diagnostic test kits for companion and food animal infectious diseases, as well as most of our livestock and poultry products and many of our rapid assay products, are licensed and regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (\u201cAPHIS\u201d). These products must be approved by APHIS before they may be sold in and from the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product validation data, including manufacturing process and facility documentation. Following regulatory licensure to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for test review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS\u00a0approval to support product registration for sale, distribution, and use within their countries. However, compliance with extensive country-specific regulatory processes is required in connection with importing and marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, Canada, Brazil, the Netherlands, China, and many other countries. We are also required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine which also covers our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. Our LPD manufacturing facility in Montpellier, France is a USDA-permitted site, and has been approved by APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products.  Water testing products. Our water tests are generally not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is regulated by the EPA, the test method must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA, and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Quanti-Tray, Filta-Max xpress, Enterolert, and SimPlate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the EPA for use under various regulatory programs. Water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world.  Dairy testing products. Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (\u201cNCIMS\u201d) milk-monitoring programs in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA as veterinary medical devices. Before these products can be sold in the U.S., performance data must be submitted in accordance with an FDA-approved protocol administered by an independent body, such as the Association of Analytical Chemists Research Institute (\u201cAOAC RI\u201d). Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be accepted by NCIMS, an oversight body that includes state, federal, and industry representatives. Our SNAP Beta-Lactam antibiotic residue test product has been accepted by the FDA, NCIMS, and AOAC RI for sale in the U.S. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI certification as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes.  Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. Our OPTI instrument systems are classified by the FDA as Class I and/or Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture, and marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our OPTI products. The FDA\u2019s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, and provide for  13 13 13   inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA via a 510(k) application before marketing or sale of such products. These OPTI products are also subject to the regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold, including the EU Medical Devices Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulation.  Human COVID-19 test products. OPTI manufactures, sells, and distributes PCR and antibody ELISA test kits for the detection of the virus that causes COVID-19. These test kits are subject to regulation by the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act, and more specifically, are sold and distributed pursuant to FDA Emergency Use Authorization. These products are also subject to the regulations governing the manufacturing and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold, including the EU Medical Devices Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulations.  Other Chemical, Environmental, and Human Health Safety Regulations. All IDEXX products must comply with applicable global product regulations, including those governing consumer product safety and materials requirements such as the Europeans Union's Electromagnetic Compatibility (\u201cEMC\u201d) Directive, the European Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (\u201cREACH\u201d), the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (\u201cRoHS\u201d) Directive, and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cWEEE\u201d) Directive. These complex regulatory requirements create risk to IDEXX\u2019s ability to market and sell our products, our business, and our financial performance. For more information about the risks associated with various U.S. and foreign government regulation, refer to \u201cVarious U.S. and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business\u201d under \u201cPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d  In the European Union, our analyzers and certain associated equipment are subject to the requirements of the RoHS Directive, which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. Other countries, including China, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey have implemented or anticipate implementing regulatory regimes similar to the RoHS Directive. Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are not subject to regulation under the European Medical Device Directive or the In Vitro Diagnostic Directive, which are both strictly applicable to human use products. However, these systems are required to meet CE certification, which require compliance with the RoHS Directive, the EMC Directive, and other safety requirements. Most countries in which we sell our products impose similar registrations and/or certification requirements.  The European Union was among the first to regulate and restrict the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products. These requirements include the Biocidal Products Regulation, which requires the use of only approved biocides in our products imported to or used in the European Union, and REACH, which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the European Union. Compliance with these regulations (and similar regulations that have been or may be adopted elsewhere, such as Australia, China, Russia, Turkey, Korea, and other countries) may require registration, notification, or certification regarding regulated substances, imposition of import restrictions, or in certain cases the redesign or reformulation of our products. Some of our products, including some of our Companion Animal products, may be subject to pending restriction of microplastics pursuant to REACH.  In the U.S., the EPA regulates chemical use similarly to the European Union. In addition, certain states have their own chemical regulations, such as California's Proposition 65, which requires businesses to provide\u00a0warnings\u00a0to California residents about significant risk of exposures to chemicals in products that are known to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm. PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which may be contained in certain IDEXX products, are a subject of increasing regulatory attention. Both the EPA and the European Union have proposed draft regulations regarding PFAS, which include restrictions, data gathering and/or phase-out requirements. In the U.S., a number of states, including Maine, where we manufacture many of our products, have also developed product reporting and/or phase-out requirements. Maine\u2019s statute requires that effective as of January 1, 2023, manufacturers of products with intentionally-added PFAS report the presence of such substances, and specifies that (subject to certain exceptions to be promulgated by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection) no product containing intentionally-added PFAS may be sold in Maine after January 1, 2030. We have applied for an extension for compliance with the reporting requirement.  In addition to the foregoing, our business is generally subject to various U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and other anti-competition authorities, and we are also subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, import and export laws and regulations, including U.S. import and export control and sanctions laws, and laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Development or acquisition of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation. These may involve medical device, water-quality and other regulations of the FDA, the EPA, the USDA, the FTC, and other federal agencies, as well as state, local and foreign governments. 14 14 14   HUMAN CAPITAL  As innovation and customer focus are important parts of our strategy to create long-term value, we aim to attract, motivate, develop, and retain talented employees at all levels who are aligned with and passionate about our Purpose by:  \u2022Building and sustaining an inclusive, ethical culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d);  \u2022Offering competitive and locally relevant compensation and benefits; and  \u2022Providing growth and development opportunities.

We provide free counseling for employees and their dependents globally through our mental wellness partner and Employee Assistance Program. Interactive holistic well-being resources are available to employees globally, including monthly educational webinars, ergonomic support, team fitness challenges, nutrition programs, and self-guided courses on a broad range of topics. In addition, all employees have access to financial education and our employees, their spouses and adult dependents in North America, can engage with a financial coach for help reaching their personal financial goals.   As the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally in early 2020, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These included having employees work from home, if their job duties allowed, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.  15 15 15   As of December 31, 2022, our offices are open and we follow public health guidance and protocols, while continuing to support flexible work options. We promote a positive workplace environment and build a collaborative culture through in-person and virtual events, including town halls, in-office celebrations, and employee-led communities. We monitor the state of the pandemic to ensure the continued safety and health of our employees.  Ensuring the health, safety, and well-being of our employees is a top priority at IDEXX. We provide our employees with the training, tools, and resources they need to safeguard their health and we empower them to put safety first. Our Environmental Health & Safety (\u201cEH&S\u201d) team oversees the IDEXX EH&S management system and our company-wide safety programs, ensuring that all of our locations implement health and safety processes to maintain and improve employee safety, reduce workplace risks, and drive continuous improvement.  Growth and Development. We are steadfast in our focus on cultivating the diverse leaders of tomorrow and making career development opportunities more accessible across the company. Much of training programs are 100% virtual and available in multiple languages. Our career development programs are designed to build capabilities and enable career progression. We also encourage employees to enhance their career development through job-related courses and degree programs.  Employee Turnover and Engagement. We monitor employee turnover and engagement to identify opportunities to strengthen our approach to human capital management. During 2022, our overall voluntary employee turnover rate was 13.3%. Our voluntary turnover among managerial employees was 6.6%.   We regularly conduct company-wide employee surveys through a third party to collect employee input on our culture, their experiences, and workplace conditions. These survey results provide insights that help us to improve employee engagement. Our most recent global employee survey received a high level of response and indicated an 84% engagement level. We leverage the insights gained from the survey to develop a roadmap for improving engagement and retention.
