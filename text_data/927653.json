Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment distributes branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar and over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) pharmaceutical drugs, and other healthcare-related products in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d). This segment provides practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment sells financial, operational, and clinical solutions to pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate sites) and provides consulting, outsourcing, technological, and other services. Our Prescription Technology Solutions segment helps solve medication access, affordability, and adherence challenges for patients by working across healthcare to connect patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma companies. RxTS serves our biopharma and life sciences partners, delivering innovative solutions that help people get the medicine they need to live healthier lives. RxTS also offers prescription price transparency, benefit insight, dispensing support services, third-party logistics, and wholesale distribution support designed to benefit stakeholders.  Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers, including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, and home health care agencies. We offer more than 285,000 national brand medical-surgical products as well as McKesson\u2019s own line of high-quality products through a network of distribution centers in the U.S. Our International segment provides distribution and services to wholesale, institutional, and retail customers in Europe and Canada where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies, and support better, safer patient care by delivering vital medicines, supplies, and information technology solutions.  U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment: Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment provides distribution and logistics services for branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and OTC pharmaceutical drugs along with other healthcare-related products to customers. This business provides solutions and services to pharmacies, hospitals, oncology and other specialty practices, pharmaceutical manufacturers, biopharma partners, physicians, payers, and patients throughout the U.S. We also source generic pharmaceutical drugs through our ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP joint venture with Walmart Inc. (\u201cClarusONE\u201d).  Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment operates and serves customers through a network of 29 distribution centers in the U.S., including two strategic redistribution centers. We invest in technology and other systems at all of our distribution centers to enhance safety, reliability, and product availability. For example, we offer McKesson ConnectSM, an internet-based ordering system that provides item look-up and real-time inventory availability as well as ordering, purchasing, third-party reconciliation, and account management functionality. We make extensive use of technology as an enabler to ensure customers have the right products at the right time in the right place. To maximize distribution efficiency and effectiveness, we follow the Six Sigma methodology, which is an analytical approach that emphasizes setting high-quality objectives, collecting data, and analyzing results to a fine degree in order to improve processes, reduce costs, and enhance service accuracy and safety. We provide solutions to our customers including supply management technology, world-class marketing programs, managed care, repackaging products, and services to help them meet their business and quality goals. We continue to implement information systems to help achieve greater consistency and accuracy both internally and for our customers. We have four primary customer pharmaceutical distribution channels: (i) retail national accounts, which include national and regional retail chains, food and drug combinations, mail order pharmacies, and mass merchandisers, (ii) community pharmacies and health (formerly described as independent, small, and medium chain retail pharmacies), (iii) institutional healthcare providers such as hospitals, health systems, integrated delivery networks, and long-term care providers, and (iv) oncology, biopharma, and other specialty partners. 4 4 4 Table of ContentsItem 1 IndexMcKESSON CORPORATION Table of ContentsItem 1 Index Table of Contents Item 1 Index McKESSON CORPORATION Retail National Accounts: We provide business solutions that help our retail national account customers increase revenues and profitability.

Oncology, Biopharma, and Other Specialty Partners: The U.S. Pharmaceutical segment provides a range of solutions to oncology and other specialty practices and offers community specialists (oncologists, rheumatologists, ophthalmologists, urologists, neurologists, and other specialists) an extensive set of customizable solutions and services designed to strengthen core practice operations, enhance value-based care delivery, and expand their service offering to patients. Community-based physicians in this business have broad flexibility and discretion to select the products and commitment levels that best meet their practice needs. Services in provider solutions include specialty drug distribution, group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPO\u201d) like Onmark\u00ae, technology solutions, practice consulting services, and vaccine distribution, including our exclusive distributor relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (\u201cCDC\u201d) Vaccines for Children program. Additionally, to support the U.S. efforts to fight the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), this segment has been distributing certain COVID-19 vaccines since December 2020 at the direction of the U.S. government.  This business provides a variety of solutions, including practice operations, healthcare information technology, revenue cycle management and managed care contracting solutions, evidence-based guidelines, and quality measurements to support The U.S. Oncology Network (\u201cUSON\u201d), one of the nation\u2019s largest networks of physician-led, integrated, community-based oncology practices dedicated to advancing high-quality, evidence-based cancer care. In October 2022, McKesson completed a transaction with HCA Healthcare, Inc. (\u201cHCA\u201d) to form an oncology research business, combining McKesson\u2019s U.S. Oncology Research (\u201cUSOR\u201d) and HCA\u2019s Sarah Cannon Research Institute (\u201cSCRI\u201d), which is one of the world\u2019s leading oncology research organizations, to enhance clinical trial access and availability across the country. This segment includes Ontada\u00ae, McKesson\u2019s oncology technology and insights business providing software to support the clinical, financial, and operational needs of our oncology practice customers. Ontada also partners with oncology providers and biopharma partners to perform real-world evidence studies, retrospective research, and to provide clinical data insights, advisory solutions and education opportunities. When we discuss specialty products or services, we consider the following factors: diseases requiring complex treatment regimens such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis; plasma and biologics products; ongoing clinical monitoring requirements, high-cost, special handling, storage, and delivery requirements and, in some cases, exclusive distribution arrangements. Our use of the term \u201cspecialty\u201d may not be comparable to that used by other industry participants, including our competitors. 6 6 6  Table of ContentsItem 1 IndexMcKESSON CORPORATION Table of ContentsItem 1 Index Table of Contents Item 1 Index McKESSON CORPORATION Prescription Technology Solutions Segment: Our Prescription Technology Solutions segment works across healthcare to connect patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma companies to deliver medication access, affordability, and adherence solutions that support patients from first prescription fill to ongoing therapy, regardless of their insurance coverage. RxTS has connections with most electronic health record systems, over 50,000 pharmacies, approximately 900,000 providers, most pharmacy benefit managers and health plans, and has supported over 650 biopharma brands representing most therapeutic areas. Through its industry connections and ability to navigate the healthcare ecosystems, RxTS offers innovative solutions created to benefit healthcare stakeholders. Its comprehensive solution suites span across the entire patient journey, including medication access and affordability, prescription decision support, prescription price transparency, benefit insight and dispensing support services, as well as third-party logistics and wholesale distribution support, to help increase speed to therapy, reduce prescription abandonment, and support improved health outcomes for the patient. In the past year, RxTS helped patients save more than $8 billion on brand and specialty medications, helped to prevent an estimated 9.9 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and helped patients access their medicine more than 78 million times.  Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment:  Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivers medical-supply distribution, logistics, biomedical maintenance, and other services to healthcare providers across the alternate-site spectrum. Our more than 275,000 customers include physician offices, surgery centers, post-acute care facilities, hospital reference labs, and home health agencies. We partner with manufacturers and channel partners to support our key target end-markets, including primary care, extended care, government, and other markets. We distribute medical-surgical supplies (such as gloves, needles, syringes, and wound care products), infusion pumps, laboratory equipment, and pharmaceuticals. Through a network of distribution centers in the U.S., we offer more than 285,000 products from national brand manufacturers and McKesson\u2019s own brand of high-quality products. Through the right mix of products and services, we help improve efficiencies, profitability, and compliance. We also never lose focus on helping customers improve patient and business outcomes. We develop customized plans to address the product, operational, and clinical support needs of our customers, including inventory management, reducing administrative burdens, and training and educating clinical staff. We deliver for our customers, so they can deliver and care for their patients. Additionally, under contracts with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) and Pfizer, Inc., McKesson\u2019s Medical-Surgical business leverages its expertise to manage the assembly, storage, and distribution of supply kits needed to administer COVID-19 vaccines, as well as some of the sourcing of those supplies. The kits are produced and distributed at the direction of HHS to support the administration of all COVID-19 vaccines approved in the U.S.   International Segment: Our International segment provides distribution and services to wholesale, institutional, and retail customers in Europe and Canada where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies. Our operations in Canada also support better, safer patient care by delivering vital medicines, supplies, and information technology solutions to customers, and through several retail health and wellness brands, across Canada. In July 2021, we announced our intention to exit our businesses in Europe. On January 31, 2022, we completed the sale of our Austrian business to Quadrifolia Management GmbH. On April 6, 2022, we completed the sale of our retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K. disposal group\u201d) to Aurelius Elephant Limited. On October 31, 2022, we completed the sale of certain of our businesses in the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) located in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and Slovenia, our German headquarters and wound-care business, part of a shared services center in Lithuania, and our ownership stake in a joint venture in the Netherlands (\u201cE.U. disposal group\u201d) to the PHOENIX Group. In executing our strategy to exit Europe, we continue to evaluate suitable exit alternatives for our remaining retail and distribution businesses in Norway. Refer to Financial Note 2, \u201cBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our European divestiture activities. Prior to the European divestiture activities described above, we operated through two businesses in Europe: Pharmaceutical Distribution and Retail Pharmacy. Our European Pharmaceutical Distribution business delivered pharmaceutical and other healthcare-related products to pharmacies across Europe. This business functioned as a vital link, using technology-enabled management systems at our regional wholesale branches to connect manufacturers to retail pharmacies, supplying medicines and other products sold in pharmacies. 7 7 7 Table of ContentsItem 1 IndexMcKESSON CORPORATION Table of ContentsItem 1 Index Table of Contents Item 1 Index McKESSON CORPORATION Our European Retail Pharmacy business served patients and consumers in European countries directly through our own pharmacies and participant pharmacies operating under brand partnership arrangements. This business provided customers with traditional prescription pharmaceuticals, non-prescription products, and medical services, as well as e-commerce operating under the Lloyds pharmacy branding in Belgium, Ireland, and Italy up until the sale of the E.U. disposal group. In addition, we partnered with independent pharmacies under local banner programs. McKesson Canada is one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and retail distributors in Canada. The wholesale business delivers products to retail pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care centers, clinics and institutions in Canada through a national network of distribution centers and provides logistics and distribution services for manufacturers. Beyond wholesale pharmaceutical logistics and distribution, McKesson Canada provides automation and technology solutions to its retail and hospital customers. Additionally, McKesson Canada provides comprehensive specialty health services to Canadians, including a national network of specialty pharmacies, personalized patient care and support programs, and INVIVA, Canada\u2019s first and largest accredited network of private infusion clinics. McKesson Canada also owns and operates PDCI, Canada\u2019s leading market access consultancy, supporting manufacturers as they introduce new products into the Canadian market. The Canada retail business includes approximately 2,700 banner pharmacies under the IDA\u00ae, Guardian\u00ae, The Medicine Shoppe\u00ae, Remedy\u2019sRx\u00ae, Proxim\u00ae, and Uniprix\u00ae banners, and approximately 400 owned pharmacies under the RexallTM brand where we provide patients with greater choice and access, integrated pharmacy care and industry-leading service levels. McKesson Canada also owns and operates Well.caTM, a leading Canadian online health and wellness retailer.  Restructuring, Business Combinations, Investments, and Divestitures  We have undertaken additional strategic initiatives in recent years designed to increase operational efficiencies, focus on our core healthcare businesses, execute on our business strategy, and enhance our competitive position. These initiatives are detailed in Financial Note 2, \u201cBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d and Financial Note 3, \u201cRestructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.  Competition We operate in highly competitive environments in North America and Europe. In recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. In the pharmaceutical distribution environment in which our U.S. Pharmaceutical and International segments operate, we face strong competition from international, national, regional, and local full-line, short-line, and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies, and large payer organizations. We consider our largest competitors in distribution, wholesaling, and logistics to be AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. Our retail businesses, which primarily operate in our International segment, face competition from various global, national, regional, and local retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies. Our RxTS business experiences substantial competition from many companies, including other biopharma services companies, software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition in this business varies in size from large to small companies, in geographical coverage, and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers, including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, home health care agencies, and other alternative sites with competition from a wide range of national and regional medical supply and equipment distributors throughout the U.S. In addition, we compete with other service providers and healthcare manufacturers, as well as other potential customers of our businesses, which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that might otherwise be provided by our businesses. We believe that our scale and diversity of product and service offerings are our primary competitive advantages. In all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer.  8 8 8  Table of ContentsItem 1 IndexMcKESSON CORPORATION Table of ContentsItem 1 Index Table of Contents Item 1 Index McKESSON CORPORATION Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Licenses McKesson and its subsidiaries hold patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets related to McKesson products and services. We pursue patent protection for our innovations and obtain copyright protection for our original works of authorship, when such protection is advantageous. Through these efforts, we have developed a portfolio of patents and copyrights in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, we have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in foreign countries. We believe that, in the aggregate, McKesson\u2019s confidential information, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses are important to its operations and market position, but we do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or any family or families of the same. We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property portfolio will be sufficient to deter misappropriation, theft, or misuse of our technology, nor that we can successfully enjoin infringers. We periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims may result in McKesson entering settlement agreements, paying damages, discontinuing use or sale of accused products, or ceasing other activities. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is inherently uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement notices would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  We hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in McKesson\u2019s products or services. While in the future it may be necessary to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations as well as our products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party.  Human Capital  Our vision for a healthier world begins with our employees, who bring our mission to life every day. We deliver programs that focus on improving employee health and wellness, creating opportunities for growth and development, and providing an inclusive workplace where our employees can reach their full potential. At March 31, 2023, we had approximately 51,000 employees worldwide, including 6,000 part-time employees. We had approximately 35,000 employees in the U.S., 13,000 employees in Canada, and 3,000 employees in Europe. Our employees in Europe primarily relate to our remaining operations in Norway. Our headcount at March 31, 2023 decreased compared to the same prior year period due to the completed divestitures of the E.U. disposal group and U.K. disposal group during fiscal 2023. Approximately 26,000 former employees were associated with these divestitures. Refer to Financial Note 2, \u201cBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our European divestiture activities. We also supplement our work force with contractors and/or consultants for certain business projects, processes, and/or operations as demand requires, including for programs such as the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and related ancillary supply kit programs.  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d): We are committed to making the principles of DEI integral to everything we do because we believe building a healthier future is everyone\u2019s business. We build successful teams by recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent and we recognize our culture of inclusion and belonging as an important element that drives long-term shareholder value. We offer various ongoing learning opportunities, such as our company-wide inclusion curriculum, to recognize, value, and leverage the diversity of our workforce, enhance the inclusiveness of our culture, and candidly discuss DEI topics. We also offer our employees the opportunity to join employee resource groups (\u201cERGs\u201d), which are voluntary, employee-led, company-sponsored groups that focus on making a difference among our employees in North America. ERGs can help employees make authentic connections, showcase leadership skills, and create a positive impact. Our ERGs make our community even stronger by connecting people of all backgrounds and experiences and enabling them to feel that they are a part of something greater. Our 11 ERGs provide community and insights into the perspectives and experiences across different ethnicities, genders, generations, disability or military/veteran status, as well as members and allies of the LGBTQIA+ community. We hold regular town hall meetings where employees can ask questions of executives and make their voices heard. 9 9 9 Table of ContentsItem 1 IndexMcKESSON CORPORATION Table of ContentsItem 1 Index Table of Contents Item 1 Index McKESSON CORPORATION At March 31, 2023, women and people of color represented the following: \u00a0McKessonOverallMcKessonLeadership (2)Metric (1)Women62\u00a0%42\u00a0%People of Color (3) (4)47\u00a0%26\u00a0% McKesson Leadership (2) Metric (1) People of Color (3) (4) (1)The data for our metrics is derived from our voluntary self-identification process as of March 31, 2023 and therefore represents our best estimate at this time.

Culture and Leadership: What sets McKesson apart as an exceptional place is our people. Our employees understand that together, unified by our global I2CARE and ILEAD principles, we fulfill our mission of improving care in every setting. Our I2CARE values (Integrity, Inclusion, Customer-First, Accountability, Respect, Excellence) are foundational to all that we do, and who we are as a company. ILEAD (Inspire, Leverage, Execute, Advance, Develop) is our common definition of and shared commitment to leadership. By embracing this commitment, we bring out the best in ourselves and position McKesson to continue to drive better health \u2013 for our company, our customers, and the patients they serve \u2013 for years to come. We promote leadership behaviors through culture initiatives that offer practical tips on how to debate, decide, and commit, be open and candid, and maintain an enterprise-first mindset when navigating conversations affecting operations within and across our business segments. These values and behaviors help make McKesson unique. Investment in Employees: To support employee growth and development, we provide regular feedback and training, and work to create and maintain an inclusive environment where everyone can bring their authentic self to work and know they are appreciated, with their perspectives heard and considered. Through training, we encourage leaders to embrace diverse perspectives and lead inclusively. Employee development programs include training, coaching, and 360-degree assessments, which can support the careers of future leaders and their teams. We offer financial assistance programs for higher education opportunities that support employees\u2019 career growth at the company.  To provide compensation that is focused on attracting and retaining talent with the skills and experience necessary for a specific role, our compensation program is built on a set of quantifiable factors defined by our guiding principles of internal equity, market competitiveness, and pay for performance. We operate in several countries and our benefits vary accordingly. Our compensation philosophy is rooted in a commitment to our people by offering a fair and transparent program that regularly assesses the competitive job market based on geography and cost of labor. We use external resources to provide competitive benchmarking analyses against other companies and set pay ranges around the median of the competitive market.\u202f\u202fAs part of our commitment to pay transparency, during fiscal 2023, we enhanced the insight and visibility of our employee compensation. The majority of our employees in North America can view the competitive base pay range for their roles as well as for new internal and external job postings. Also, the pay range for new external job postings is included on McKesson\u2019s website (www.mckesson.com under the \u201cCareers\u201d caption).  We offer health and wellness benefits to advance the physical, mental, and social well-being of our people, savings programs to help prepare them for retirement, and flexible work arrangements, among other offerings, when possible. We seek employee feedback through annual and mid-year employee opinion surveys, which assesses our employees\u2019 levels of engagement, commitment, and overall satisfaction using industry benchmarks, and then design action plans to improve those metrics. We seek feedback on our people leaders through our annual manager quality survey, which is an opportunity for employees to help their managers grow professionally and build valuable leadership skills that create a positive, productive, and inclusive workplace at McKesson. 10 10 10 Table of ContentsItem 1 IndexMcKESSON CORPORATION Table of ContentsItem 1 Index Table of Contents Item 1 Index McKESSON CORPORATION As broader U.S. labor markets continue to be challenging and evolving, we continue our dedication to recruiting and retaining qualified employees across the organization. In fiscal 2022, we made investments in our talent acquisition team by adding recruiters, systems, and process improvements to strengthen our ability to attract employees and reduce the lead time to fill open positions as well as updating and enhancing the benefits, rewards, and experiences we offer to our employees, making McKesson a great place to work. This is known as our \u201cEmployee Value Proposition\u201d (\u201cEVP\u201d). Our EVP reflects what makes McKesson unique and which is demonstrated through the care we show to our employees and communities, the meaning we find in our work, and the sense of belonging we build across the organization. We continued to make investments in fiscal 2023 to retain our top talent, including providing long-term incentive awards for certain job markets and job classes. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we approved changes to our real estate strategy to increase efficiencies and support flexibility for our employees, as discussed in Financial Note 3, \u201cRestructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Our North American future of work approach is based on the following for certain employees: purposeful collaboration, flexibility, co-location, and leader-driven connections. We embraced a hybrid work model and certain of our employees have been coming together in person to collaborate with a purpose. While we remain committed to working flexibly, collaboration will continue to be a cornerstone of our philosophy. We believe that collaboration is critically important to staying connected and maintaining our culture.  Health and Safety: Our security and safety departments employ systems designed to continually monitor our facilities and work environment to help identify and prevent or mitigate potential risks. This includes having procedures in place and investing in equipment for both physical and electronic security. We routinely assess facilities to closely monitor adherence to established security and safety standards. If we identify a vulnerability, it is documented, and the facility prepares an action plan. Our employees receive specialized training related to their role, work setting, and equipment used in their work environment. As our processes evolve, we update relevant safety training modules, which may include new employee training programs.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has been, and continues to be, protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers, patients, and communities while also safeguarding the healthcare supply chain. We offer medical benefits covering COVID-19 related visits, testing (including over-the-counter tests), treatment and vaccines, telehealth options, and paid time off (\u201cPTO\u201d). We also have COVID-19 protocols in place, which have been designed, and updated as necessary, to be consistent with federal, state, and local laws and with customer requirements for our U.S. and Canada employees.  Government Regulation We operate in many highly regulated industries and are subject to oversight by various federal, state, and local governmental entities in the U.S. and elsewhere. We incur significant expense and make large capital expenditures and investments to enable us to comply with regulations and guidance promulgated by governmental entities. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I below for information regarding material risks associated with our compliance with governmental regulations.  Controlled Substances: We are subject to the operating and security standards of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), HHS, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, and comparable agencies in the U.S. and other countries. Certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with government agencies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. For example, we are required to hold valid DEA and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards, and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, distribution, and disposal of controlled substances. We maintain extensive controlled substance monitoring and reporting programs at considerable expense in order to help us meet those standards.  Government Contracts: Our contracts with government entities typically are subject to procurement laws that include socio-economic, employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting, and other requirements. These statutory and regulatory requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden. We are subject to audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings about our compliance with contractual and legal requirements.  11 11 11 Table of ContentsItem 1 IndexMcKESSON CORPORATION Table of ContentsItem 1 Index Table of Contents Item 1 Index McKESSON CORPORATION Federal, state, and local governmental entities in the U.S. and elsewhere continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny of practices that may indicate fraud, waste, and abuse affecting government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers, healthcare providers, and other companies and individuals, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to statutes, regulations, and government guidance that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse. Among other things, those laws: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of an individual for, or to induce the ordering or purchasing of, items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose many restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under Medicare and Medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many of these laws are vague or indefinite and are often subject to varied and evolving interpretations by courts, regulators, and enforcing agencies and, as such, may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations at added expense.  Healthcare Regulation: In the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. The implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cIR Act\u201d) is anticipated to change benefit design and how Medicare pays for drugs, which are all intended to reduce the price of drugs. Three central features of the IR Act would authorize the government to negotiate drug prices for certain Parts B and D drugs over time, establish an inflation rebate program, and cap patient cost sharing under Medicare.  Provincial governments in Canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. For example, provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic drug manufacturers. McKesson continues to advocate for policies that would improve drug cost transparency under a patient's drug plan to better inform prescribing decisions, and also address access to care, affordability, and treatment regimen adherence, all designed to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the health spending burden. Additionally, there have been increasing efforts by governments to regulate the pharmaceutical drug supply chain in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. For example, the U.S. Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (\u201cDQSA\u201d) requires us to participate in a federal prescription drug track and trace system that preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 requires the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies, such as track and trace or authentication technologies, to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act requires standardized, unit-level traceability of pharmaceutical products along the entire drug supply chain, with a goal of end-to-end unit-level traceability by November 27, 2023. Pedigree tracking laws such as these increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs. Data Security and Privacy: We are subject to many privacy and data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our efforts to comply with these laws complicates our operations and adds to our costs. For example, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) we must maintain administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to protect individually identifiable health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information. We are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d) in Canada, and an expanding list of comprehensive state privacy laws in the United States. Some privacy laws prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions or otherwise limit our use of data. Many of these laws also require us to provide access or other data rights (modification, deletion, portability, etc.) to consumers\u2019 and patients\u2019 individual personal data records within specified periods of time. Laws such as the federal Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 may require us to provide notifications of significant data privacy breaches or cybersecurity incidents before our investigations are complete. We are subject to privacy and data protection compliance audits or investigations by various government agencies.  12 12 12 Table of ContentsItem 1 IndexMcKESSON CORPORATION Table of ContentsItem 1 Index Table of Contents Item 1 Index McKESSON CORPORATION Environmental Regulation: We are subject to many environmental and hazardous materials regulations, including those relating to radiation-emitting equipment operated at U.S. Oncology Network practices. Additionally, our operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites.  We sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations. Agreements with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These matters are described further in Financial Note 17, \u201cCommitments and Contingent Liabilities,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Climate Change Regulation: Governments in the U.S. and abroad are considering new or expanded laws to address climate change. Such laws may require reductions of greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions, mandates that companies implement processes to monitor and disclose climate-related matters, additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources, and other requirements. Compliance with climate-related laws may be further complicated by disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions. New or expanded climate-related laws could impose costs on us, including capital expenditures to develop data gathering and reporting systems and additional GHG reduction measures. Until the timing and extent of climate-related laws are clarified, we cannot predict their potential effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position.  Other Information about the Business Customers: During fiscal 2023, sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d) accounted for approximately 68% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (\u201cCVS\u201d), accounted for approximately 27% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2023, we extended our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS to June 2027. Our ten largest customers comprised approximately 42%, and CVS was approximately 21%, of our total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2023. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies, and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. Substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.  Suppliers: We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which accounted for more than our largest supplier at 12% of our total purchases in fiscal 2023. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally sound. The ten largest suppliers in fiscal 2023 accounted for approximately 70% of our total purchases. Some of our distribution arrangements with manufacturers provide us consideration based on a percentage of our purchases. In addition, we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflation-based consideration component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices. For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us, could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin. Research and Development: Research and development expenses were $89\u00a0million, $70\u00a0million, and $74\u00a0million for the years ended March 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
