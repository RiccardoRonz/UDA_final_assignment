{"cik": 1170010, "item_1A": "Item 1.\u00a0\u00a0Business. BUSINESS OVERVIEW  CarMax Background CarMax, Inc. delivers an unrivaled customer experience by offering a broad selection of quality used vehicles and related products and services at competitive, no-haggle prices using a customer-friendly sales process.\u00a0\u00a0We are the nation\u2019s largest retailer of used cars, and we sold 807,823 used vehicles at retail during the fiscal year ended February\u00a028, 2023.\u00a0\u00a0We are also one of the nation\u2019s largest operators of wholesale vehicle auctions, with 585,071 vehicles sold during fiscal 2023, and one of the nation\u2019s largest providers of used vehicle financing, servicing approximately 1.1 million customer accounts in our $16.77\u00a0billion portfolio of managed receivables as of February\u00a028, 2023.  Our omni-channel platform, which gives us the largest addressable market in the used car industry, empowers our retail customers to buy a car on their terms \u2013 online, in-store or an integrated combination of both. CarMax was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1996.\u00a0\u00a0CarMax, Inc. is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries.\u00a0\u00a0Under the ownership of Circuit City Stores, Inc. (\u201cCircuit City\u201d), we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first CarMax store in Richmond, Virginia.\u00a0\u00a0On October\u00a01,\u00a02002, the CarMax business was separated from Circuit City through a tax-free transaction, becoming an independent, publicly traded company.\u00a0\u00a0As of February\u00a028, 2023, we operated 240 used car stores in 109 U.S. television markets.\u00a0\u00a0Our home office is located at 12800 Tuckahoe Creek Parkway, Richmond, Virginia. On June 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Edmunds Holding Company (\u201cEdmunds\u201d), one of the most well established and trusted online guides for automotive information and a recognized leader in digital car shopping innovations.  With this acquisition, CarMax has enhanced its digital capabilities and further strengthened its role and reach across the used auto ecosystem while adding exceptional technology and creative talent.  CarMax Business We operate in two reportable segments:\u00a0\u00a0CarMax Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance (\u201cCAF\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0Our CarMax Sales Operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations, excluding financing provided by CAF.\u00a0\u00a0Our CAF segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from CarMax.  Our consolidated financial statements include the financial results related to our Edmunds business, which does not meet the definition of a reportable segment.    CarMax Sales Operations. \u00a0Our CarMax Sales Operations segment sells used vehicles, purchases used vehicles from customers and other sources, sells related products and services, and arranges financing options for customers, all for competitive, no-haggle prices.  We enable our customers to separately evaluate each component of the sales process based on comprehensive information about the terms and associated prices of each component.  Customers can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer. Purchasing a Vehicle:\u00a0 The vehicle purchase process at CarMax differs fundamentally from the traditional auto retail experience.\u00a0\u00a0Our no-haggle pricing removes a frequent customer frustration with the purchase process and allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for other consumer products.\u00a0\u00a0Our omni-channel platform further empowers our customers to buy a car on their own terms \u2013 online, in-store, or an integrated combination of both.  Our omni-channel platform provides multiple ways for our customers to interact with us, including completely online.  A customer may interact with our customer experience consultants via phone, text messages or chat. These employees are paid a fixed hourly rate and receive incentive bonuses based on their ability to effectively progress the customer through their car-buying journey.  Customers may also interact in-person with our sales consultants who are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollars-per-unit standard, thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold, the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate.  These pay structures align our associates\u2019 interests with those of our customers, in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates, or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits. We recondition every used vehicle we retail to meet our CarMax Quality Certified standards, and each vehicle must pass an inspection before being offered for sale.\u00a0\u00a0We stand behind every used vehicle we sell with our Love Your Car Guarantee.  This guarantee gives customers the ability to take 24-hour test drives before committing to purchase as well as provides a 30-day/1,500 mile money-back guarantee and a 90-day/4,000-mile limited warranty.  Our CarMax Quality Certified standards were developed internally by CarMax and are not affiliated with any third party or original equipment manufacturer program. 5 5 5   We maximize customer choice by offering a large selection of inventory on our lots and by making our nationwide inventory available for viewing on carmax.com as well as our mobile app.\u00a0 As of February\u00a028, 2023, we had approximately 56,000 saleable retail vehicles in our inventory.  Vehicles in-transit or on customer hold are not visible on our website.  Upon request by a customer, we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our inventory.\u00a0\u00a0This gives CarMax customers access to a much larger selection of vehicles than any traditional auto retailer.\u00a0\u00a0In fiscal 2023, approximately 34% of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request. Selling us a Vehicle: We have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions.\u00a0\u00a0We will appraise a customer\u2019s vehicle in-person free of charge and make a written, guaranteed offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us.\u00a0\u00a0This no-haggle offer is good for seven days.\u00a0 We also provide online instant appraisal offers, which quickly give customers an offer on their vehicle.  The success of these offerings strengthens our leadership position as the largest used vehicle buyer from consumers in the U.S. Vehicle purchases are also made through MaxOffer, our digital appraisal product for dealers.  We leverage the Edmunds sales team to open new markets and sign-up new dealers for MaxOffer. In fiscal 2023, we purchased approximately 1.2 million vehicles from consumers and dealers. Based on age, mileage or condition, approximately half of the vehicles acquired through our appraisal processes meet our retail standards.\u00a0\u00a0Those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our wholesale auctions.\u00a0\u00a0Unlike many other auto auctions, we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions, which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate.  This high sales rate, combined with dealer-friendly practices, makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for licensed dealers. \u00a0For fiscal 2023, our average auction sales rate was approximately 95%. Financing a Vehicle: The availability of financing is a critical component of the vehicle purchase process, and having an array of finance sources increases approvals, expands access to financing for our customers and mitigates risk to CarMax.\u00a0\u00a0Our finance program accommodates customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through both CAF and third-party providers.\u00a0\u00a0We believe that our processes and systems, transparency of pricing, and vehicle quality, as well as the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit, enable CAF and our third-party providers to make underwriting decisions in a unique and advantageous environment distinct from the traditional auto retail environment.\u00a0\u00a0All finance offers, whether from CAF or our third-party providers, are backed by a 3-day payoff option, which allows customers to refinance their loan with another finance provider within three business days at no charge.\u00a0 In fiscal 2023, we completed the nationwide rollout of our pre-qualification and finance-based shopping products, which are supported by CAF and multiple third-party providers.  These products enable customers to request pre-qualification online with no impact to credit scores and receive their decisions and terms within minutes, empowering them to conveniently shop with their personalized, pre-qualification terms across our nationwide inventory.  These products seamlessly provide consumers with the information and capabilities they need to shop for financing that best meets their budget and needs, further differentiating CarMax\u2019s customer-centric financing experience.  We have also established an online checkout and purchasing product, which integrates our financing process, allowing eligible customers to apply and accept finance offers online without the assistance of an associate.  We continue to enhance and further expand these products and experiences. Related Products and Services: We provide customers with a range of other related products and services, including extended protection plan (\u201cEPP\u201d) products and vehicle repair service.  EPP products include\u00a0extended service plans (\u201cESPs\u201d)\u00a0and\u00a0guaranteed asset protection (\u201cGAP\u201d), which\u00a0is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft.\u00a0 Our ESP customers have access to vehicle repair service at each CarMax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers.\u00a0\u00a0We believe that the broad scope of our ESPs helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty, and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business.\u00a0\u00a0In fiscal 2023, approximately 60% of the customers who purchased a retail used vehicle also purchased an ESP and approximately 16% purchased GAP. CarMax Auto Finance. \u00a0CAF provides financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from CarMax.\u00a0\u00a0CAF allows us to manage our reliance on third-party finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option.\u00a0 CAF utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history and other credit data of the customer along with CAF\u2019s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment.\u00a0\u00a0Because CAF offers financing solely to CarMax customers, our scoring models are optimized for the CarMax channel.\u00a0\u00a0We believe CAF  6 6 6   enables us to capture additional profits, cash flows and sales.\u00a0\u00a0After the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, CAF financed 42.1% of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2023. CAF also services all auto loans it originates and is responsible for providing billing statements, collecting payments, maintaining contact with delinquent customers, and arranging for the repossession of vehicles securing defaulted loans.\u00a0 Competition\u00a0 CarMax Sales Operations. \u00a0The U.S. used car marketplace is highly fragmented, and we face competition from franchised dealers, who sell both new and used vehicles; online sellers; independent used car dealers; and private parties.  According to industry sources, as of December\u00a031, 2022, there were over 18,000 franchised dealers in the U.S., who sell the majority of late-model used vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0Competition in our industry has evolved with the adoption of online platforms and marketing tools, all of which facilitate increased competition.  Based on industry data, there were approximately 37 million used cars sold in the U.S. in calendar 2022, of which approximately 20 million  were estimated to be age 0- to 10-year old vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0While we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the U.S., in calendar 2022, we estimate we sold approximately 4.0% of the age 0- to 10-year old vehicles sold on a nationwide basis, consistent with calendar 2021.  We estimate we sold approximately 4.8% of the age 0- to 10-year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate in calendar 2022, consistent with 2021.  Our market share is generally correlated to the length of time we have operated in a given market.   We believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the car-buying experience by virtue of our competitive, no-haggle prices and our customer-friendly sales process; our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available; the quality of our vehicles; our proprietary information systems; the transparency and availability of CAF and third-party financing; the locations of our retail stores; and our commitment to evolving our car-buying experience to meet customers\u2019 changing expectations.\u00a0\u00a0We believe our omni-channel platform reinforces our competitive advantages as it empowers customers to buy a car on their own terms, whether online, in-store or through an integrated combination of online and in-store experiences.  Our diversified business model, combined with our exceptional associates and unparalleled omni-channel experience, is a unique advantage in the used car industry that firmly positions us to drive profitable market share gains while creating shareholder value over the long-term. In addition, we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer\u2019s vehicle, whether or not the customer is buying a car from us, provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0Our high volume of appraisal purchases, which has increased further with the rollout of our instant appraisal offers and MaxOffer, supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory, but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that do not meet our retail standards. Our wholesale auctions compete with other automotive in-person and online auctions.\u00a0\u00a0These competitors auction vehicles of all ages, while CarMax\u2019s auctions predominantly sell older, higher mileage vehicles.  Our wholesale auctions were conducted virtually through the majority of fiscal 2023.  In January 2023, we began testing blended in-person and virtual auctions at one location. CarMax Auto Finance. \u00a0CAF operates and is a significant participant in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market.\u00a0\u00a0This sector is primarily comprised of banks, captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers, credit unions and independent finance companies.\u00a0\u00a0According to industry sources, this sector represented more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding receivables as of December\u00a031, 2022. \u00a0CAF\u2019s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing used cars.\u00a0\u00a0 We believe that CAF\u2019s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source for CarMax customers, and that CAF\u2019s primary driver for growth is the growth in CarMax\u2019s retail used unit sales.\u00a0\u00a0We periodically test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness.\u00a0\u00a0We also monitor 3-day payoffs, as the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our offer. Products and Services Retail Merchandising. \u00a0We offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles, including domestic, imported and luxury vehicles, as well as hybrid and electric vehicles, at competitive prices.\u00a0\u00a0Our focus is vehicles that are 0 to 10 years old; these vehicles have historically ranged in price from $11,000 to $37,000, however, similar to fiscal 2022, the past year generally ranged in price from $16,000 to $49,000 due to higher vehicle acquisition costs driven by market  7 7 7   appreciation.\u00a0\u00a0The mix of our used vehicle inventory by make, model and age will vary from time to time, depending on consumer preferences, seasonality and market pricing and availability. Wholesale Auctions. \u00a0The typical vehicle sold at our wholesale auctions is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100,000 miles.\u00a0\u00a0We provide condition disclosures on each vehicle, including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues, possible frame or flood damage, branded titles, salvage history and unknown true mileage.\u00a0\u00a0Professional, licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions.\u00a0 Dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase.\u00a0\u00a0Our auctions are generally held on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.\u00a0\u00a0  Extended Protection Plans. \u00a0In conjunction with the sale of a vehicle, we offer customers EPP products.\u00a0\u00a0We receive revenue for selling these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties, who are the primary obligors.\u00a0\u00a0We have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements.\u00a0\u00a0The ESPs we currently offer on all used retail vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months (subject to mileage limitations).\u00a0\u00a0GAP covers the customer for the term of their finance contract.\u00a0\u00a0The EPPs that we sell have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through private-label arrangements.\u00a0 Periodically, we may receive profit-sharing revenues based upon the performance of the ESP policies administered by third parties.  As of February\u00a028, 2023, our third-party ESP providers included Assurant, Inc., CNA National Warranty Corporation and Fidelity Warranty Services, Inc.  Our third-party GAP provider as of February\u00a028, 2023 was Safe-Guard Products International LLC. Reconditioning and Service. \u00a0An integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process designed to make sure every car meets our internal standards before it can become a CarMax Quality Certified vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0This process includes an inspection of the engine and all major systems.\u00a0\u00a0Based on this inspection, we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our internal quality standards.\u00a0\u00a0Many of our stores depend upon nearby, typically larger, CarMax stores for reconditioning, which increases efficiency and reduces overhead.\u00a0\u00a0We perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs in-house; however, for some reconditioning services, including, but not limited to, services related to manufacturer\u2019s warranties, we engage third parties specializing in those services.  CarMax does not have manufacturer authorization to complete recall-related repairs, and some vehicles CarMax sells may have unrepaired safety recalls.  However, safety recall information, as reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is available on our website, and we review any unrepaired safety recall information with our used vehicle customers before purchase. All CarMax used car stores provide vehicle repair service, including repairs of vehicles covered by the ESPs we sell.  Additionally, we have partnered with third-party providers of auto service and repair.  Through these partnerships, our customers have access to a nationwide network of trusted, quality and fair-priced service and repair locations. Customer Credit. \u00a0We offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through CAF and arrangements with several financial institutions.\u00a0\u00a0Vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0As of February\u00a028, 2023, our third-party finance providers included Ally Financial, American Credit Acceptance, Capital One Auto Finance, Chase Auto Finance, Exeter Finance Corp., Santander Consumer USA and Westlake Financial Services.\u00a0 We have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged and held by third-party providers, and we periodically test additional third-party providers. Generally, credit applications submitted by customers to CarMax are initially reviewed by CAF using our proprietary underwriting standards.  Based on that review, CAF makes financing offers designed to create a loan portfolio that meets our targeted risk profile in the aggregate.\u00a0\u00a0Applications that CAF declines or approves with conditions are generally evaluated by other third-party finance providers.\u00a0\u00a0Third-party providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract.\u00a0\u00a0We refer to the providers who generally pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as Tier 2 providers and we refer to providers to whom we pay a fee as Tier 3 providers.\u00a0\u00a0We are willing to pay a fee to Tier 3 providers because we believe their participation provides us with incremental sales by enabling customers to secure financing that they may not otherwise be able to obtain.\u00a0\u00a0All fees either received or paid are pre-negotiated at a fixed amount and do not vary based on the amount financed,\u00a0the interest rate, the term of the loan or the loan-to-value ratio.\u00a0\u00a0CAF also provides financing for a small percentage of customers who would typically be financed by a Tier 2 or Tier 3 provider. We do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions.\u00a0\u00a0However, we have made arrangements to have third-party financing available to our auction customers. Suppliers for Used Vehicles\u00a0 We acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our in-store and online appraisal processes, as well as through local, regional and online auctions.  Prior to fiscal 2022, our annual self-sufficiency rate was between 36% and 41%.  Driven primarily by our new online instant appraisal offer programs, we achieved record self- 8 8 8   sufficiency rates of approximately 70% during fiscal 2022 and over 70% during fiscal 2023.  The buy rate for customers who engage with us after first receiving an online instant appraisal offer is typically higher than through our traditional appraisal lane.  We also acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers, franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners, such as leasing companies and rental companies.\u00a0\u00a0The used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market.\u00a0 The supply of late-model used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors, including the total number of vehicles in operation; the volume of new vehicle sales, which in turn generate used car trade-ins; and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels, wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions.\u00a0\u00a0According to industry sources, there were approximately 285 million light vehicles in operation in the U.S. as of December\u00a031, 2022.\u00a0\u00a0During calendar year 2022, it is estimated that approximately 14 million new cars and 37 million used cars were sold at retail, many of which were accompanied by trade-ins, and approximately  9.5 million wholesale vehicles were sold at auctions and through other channels. Based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year, consumer acceptance of our appraisal process, our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources, and the large size of the U.S. auction market relative to our needs, we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs. Seasonality Historically, our business has been seasonal.\u00a0\u00a0Our stores typically experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer, with an increase in traffic and sales in February and March, coinciding with federal income tax refunds.  Sales are typically slowest in the fall.\u00a0\u00a0In fiscal 2021 and 2022, traffic and sales were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related federal payments.  In fiscal 2023, sales returned to more normal seasonal patterns. Technology  We leverage a combination of cloud-based solutions and proprietary technologies to run our operations.  We have a strong software engineering discipline and we have adopted Agile, DevOps, Lean and other leading digital delivery practices.  Technology teams are tightly integrated with the rest of the business and are embedded within our cross-functional \u201cProduct\u201d teams.  Our Product teams use a \u201ctest and learn\u201d approach to iterate and deploy new technology-enabled experiences to our associates and customers.  We use advanced data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to optimize our business and the customer experience.  Our business is supported by digital and mobile technologies that provide enhanced customer experience while enabling highly integrated automation of all operating functions, including credit processing and supply chain management.\u00a0\u00a0Buyers and sales consultants are equipped with mobile and centralized tools that allow them to access real-time information to better serve our customers.  Our proprietary digital technology provides our management with real-time information about many aspects of our omni-channel operations, such as inventory management, pricing, vehicle transfers, wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity.  Real-time access to a complete view of our customer interactions from omni-channel allows our associates to provide a tailored and differentiated experience to our customers. Our proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process and allows us to buy the mix of makes, models, age, mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each CarMax location.\u00a0\u00a0Leveraging our more than twenty-five years of experience buying and selling millions of used vehicles, our system generates recommended initial retail price points, as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on algorithms that account for factors including sales history, consumer interest and seasonal patterns.\u00a0\u00a0We believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns, which reduces the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit.\u00a0 Because of the pricing discipline afforded by our inventory management and pricing system, generally 99%\u00a0of our entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail. Marketing and Advertising Our marketing strategies are focused on driving customer growth through building awareness and affinity for the brand and acquiring in-market shoppers and sellers.  These strategies are implemented through a broad range of media including, but not limited to, traditional broadcast, digital, search, social, out-of-home, sports sponsorships and newer influencer and activation programs.\u00a0\u00a0Our website and related mobile app received an average of 31 million monthly visits during fiscal 2023 and are a critical part of the customer\u2019s journey, allowing them to learn about CarMax, explore our full inventory in real time, initiate vehicle transfers, apply for financing pre-qualification, receive an appraisal offer and even buy a car fully online.  Our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2023, approximately 98% of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online.   In fiscal 2023, we continued building the CarMax brand through new creative campaigns and approaches promoting instant offers and our Love Your Car Guarantee. We highlighted our 30-day money back guarantee this fall in our Car Buying  9 9 9   Reimagined campaign.  In addition, our Call Your Shot campaign showcased the flexibility of CarMax\u2019s omni-channel experience.  Human Capital Resources CarMax\u2019s purpose, to drive integrity by being honest and transparent in every interaction, is brought to life each day by our associates\u2019 commitment to living our core values.  We recognize that our associates are the key to our success, and we are proud to provide an award-winning workplace where we value the diversity and contribution of all associates and foster a culture where associates can achieve their career goals.  Our associates are further guided by the policies and procedures we have in place to ensure everyone is treated with respect and has opportunities to reach their full potential.   On February\u00a028, 2023, we had a total of 30,621 full- and part-time associates, of which 936 work in our CAF segment and 474 work for our Edmunds business.  We had 25,632 hourly and salaried associates, as well as 3,430 in-store sales associates,  1,450 sales associates in our Customer Experience Centers (\u201cCECs\u201d) and 109 Edmunds sales associates.  Our in-store sales associates predominantly work on a commission basis while our CEC sales associates are hourly employees who are incentive eligible.  We employ additional associates during peak selling seasons.  No associate is subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  We annually review our pay in each geographic market to ensure we are providing a fair and competitive wage.  As of February\u00a028, 2023, all our associates were paid above the applicable minimum wage.  We also offer health and other benefits to all our full-time associates. Throughout the implementation of our omni-channel car buying experience, the shape of our workforce has evolved and the number of technology, product and data science associates has increased.  As of February\u00a028, 2023, we had 1,386 technology, product and data science associates.  In response, we created a rotational program for college technology hires and implemented a technology and data science reskilling program.  As part of our standard compensation plan, we provide equity for all roles working on our innovation efforts as a meaningful engagement and retention tool.  We believe this evolution in our workforce has been and will continue to be critical to the development of our technology platforms and strategic initiatives. Our commitment to our associates is reflected in our fair and broad-based compensation packages and benefit programs, our continuous investment in talent acquisition, engagement, and development activities, and our comprehensive safety and security program.  We review pay equity annually based on objective factors such as position, tenure, and location.  If we find discrepancies that cannot be explained by these objective factors, we make appropriate adjustments.  Our commitment is to provide equal pay for comparable work regardless of gender, age, race or ethnicity. We have been recognized for 19 consecutive years as one of Fortune magazine\u2019s 100 Best Companies to Work For\u00ae and have also been recognized as one of Training magazine\u2019s \u201cTraining APEX Award\u201d recipients for 16 years in a row.  These awards reflect our ability to provide associates with the tools and environment they need to succeed and grow in their careers.  We have an Associate Experience Team and a cross-functional Associate Experience Advisory Group dedicated to ensuring an inclusive and engaging workplace.  We also continued to measure engagement via biannual associate pulse surveys, and across the company teams created focused plans to continually improve engagement based on survey results.  Our goal is to achieve world-class associate engagement and responding to associate feedback enables us to focus on the issues that matter to our associates. Diversity and Inclusion.  The CarMax culture of diversity and inclusion is built on a foundation of integrity and respect, and we encourage the diverse backgrounds and perspectives our associates bring to locations across the country.  Our diversity and inclusion commitment is based on a company vision to ensure everyone, everywhere has the opportunity to reach their full potential.  As of February\u00a028, 2023, our non-management workforce was 28.3% female and 71.7% male and 43.4% non-diverse and 56.6% diverse.  The breakdown for our management workforce was 24.2% female and 75.8% male and 69.3% non-diverse and 30.7% diverse.  For purposes of workforce diversity, CarMax considers ethnic and racial minorities as diverse and defines management as director and above at the corporate level and the top four managers at the store level and CEC level, as a group.   Our diversity and inclusion governance model includes a council as well as an executive steering committee, of which the CEO is a member.  We also have a Corporate Social Responsibility (\u201cCSR\u201d) team, led by our Vice President, CSR.  The CSR team includes, in part, the Community Relations, Diversity and Inclusion, Employer Brand and Internal Communications teams. We have a company-wide associate training program on diversity and inclusion.  This program includes required trainings for all associates, with a completion rate of over 95% in fiscal 2023.  Our board of directors participated in this training as well, with a 100% completion rate in fiscal 2023.  The program also includes additional self-service training and learning materials as well as leader perspective videos and discussion guides to aid team conversations. 10 10 10   In fiscal 2023, we refined our multi-year diversity and inclusion roadmap with the approval of our board of directors that contains specific actions, objectives, and success measures spanning associate, customer, and community stakeholder groups. In addition, we developed our supplier diversity roadmap to help ensure that our partners have equal opportunities to do business with us; the strategic importance of this roadmap's development was further emphasized by its inclusion as a performance metric in our fiscal 2023 corporate bonus program. Our diversity and inclusion roadmap and incentives are intended to solidify our commitment to diversity and inclusion as we further ingrain diversity and inclusion into the organization, nurturing our talent, increasing our associate engagement, and improving our relationships with customers and suppliers alike. We plan to publish our 2023 Responsibility Report in May 2023, where we will further describe our broader environmental, social and governance efforts.
