{"cik": 1413329, "item_1A": "Item 1.Business. \u00a0 General Development of Business   \u00a0 General \u00a0 Philip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987.  We are a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and to evolve our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, which include heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products. Since 2008, we have invested more than $10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\")  \u2013 a leader in oral nicotine delivery \u2013 creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has authorized versions of our IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables, and Swedish Match's General snus, as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (\"MRTPs\"). We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    In March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").  In 2021, we laid the foundation for our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare, including the milestone acquisitions of Vectura Group PLC and Fertin Pharma A/S, which provide essential capabilities for future product development. Now, through our Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary, with a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, we aim to expand into wellness and healthcare areas.  In the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired Swedish Match, a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition is a key milestone in PMI\u2019s transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. PMI consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022, include the results of operations of Swedish Match from November 11, 2022 (acquisition date) to December 31, 2022. The operating results of Swedish Match are included in a separate segment.   In the fourth quarter of 2022, we also completed an agreement with Altria Group, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering IQOS as of April 30, 2024. Thereafter, PMI will have the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S.  For further details of our 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, see Item 8, Note 3. Acquisitions and Note 13. Segment Reporting.  Smoke-free products (\"SFPs\") is the term we primarily use to refer to all of our products that are not combustible tobacco products, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral nicotine. In addition, SFPs include wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories such as lighters and matches.  Reduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing to smoke. We have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our RRPs are smoke-free products that contain and/or generate far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.  Our IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.\u00a0 Our leading smoke-free platform (\"Platform 1\") uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our BLENDS, HEETS, HEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO (defined collectively as \"HEETS\"), Marlboro Dimensions, Marlboro HeatSticks, Parliament HeatSticks, SENTIA and TEREA, as well as the KT&G-licensed brands, Fiit and Miix (outside of South Korea).  Platform 1 was first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014.  As of December 31, 2022, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 73 markets.    Swedish Match already has a leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the ZYN brand name. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading  1 1 1   heat-not-burn product.  By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.     Our cigarettes are sold in approximately 175 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro, the world\u2019s best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 39% of our total 2022 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament. Our other leading international cigarette brands are Chesterfield, L&M, and Philip Morris. These five international cigarette brands contributed approximately 77% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2022. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna A in Indonesia, and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.    Source of Funds \u2014 Dividends    \u00a0 We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law.  \u00a0 Description of Business  \u00a0 As of December 31, 2022, we managed our business in six geographical segments, a Swedish Match segment and a Wellness and Healthcare segment:    \u2022The European Union Region (\u201cEU\u201d) is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries and also Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and the United Kingdom; \u2022The Eastern Europe Region (\u201cEE\u201d) is also headquartered in Lausanne, and includes Southeast Europe, Central Asia, Ukraine, Israel and Russia; \u2022The Middle East & Africa Region (\u201cME&A\u201d) is also headquartered in Lausanne, and covers the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey and our international duty free business; \u2022The South & Southeast Asia Region (\u201cS&SA\u201d) is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes Indonesia, the Philippines and other markets in this region;  \u2022The East Asia & Australia Region (\u201cEA&A\u201d) is also headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes Australia, Japan, South Korea, the People's Republic of China (\"China\") and other markets in this region, as well as Malaysia and Singapore; \u2022The Americas Region (\u201cAMCS\u201d) is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Canada;  \u2022Swedish Match, which reflects our fourth quarter 2022 acquisition of the company; and \u2022Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&H\"), which includes the operating results of our new Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma.  In the third quarter of 2021, we acquired Fertin Pharma A/S, Vectura Group plc. (also known as Vectura Group Ltd.) and OtiTopic, Inc.  On March 31, 2022, we launched a new Wellness and Healthcare business consolidating these entities, Vectura Fertin Pharma.  The operating results of this new business are reported in the Wellness and Healthcare segment.    To further support the growth of our smoke-free business, reinforce consumer centricity, and increase the speed of innovation and deployment, in January 2023, we rearranged our operations in four geographical segments, down from the current six and as follows: \u2022Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;  \u2022South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.  It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia; 2 2 2   \u2022East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia & Australia; and \u2022Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.    The operations of Swedish Match and our Wellness and Healthcare segment remained unchanged.  We will report our financial results based on the new geographical segments as of the first quarter of 2023.  In November 2022, we completed the relocation of our corporate headquarters, including our AMCS headquarters, from New York, New York, to Stamford, Connecticut.    Our total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 1.6% in 2022 to 731.1 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 109.2 billion units in 2022, up from 95.0 billion units in 2021.  Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro, increased by 2.0% in 2022.  References in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China and/or our duty free business.  Unless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units.    Estimates for total industry volume and market share in certain geographies reflect limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data during pandemic-related restrictions.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro, L&M, Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield, which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we primarily sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the IQOS brand. We also sell other smoke-free products, including those commercialized through Swedish Match. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.  The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; novel products which given their taste characteristics may be more commercially successful; higher tobacco product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our RRPs.   Competitors in our industry include British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Some competitors have different profit, volume and regulatory objectives, and some international competitors may be less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates than we are. Certain new market entrants in the non-combustible product category may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our RRPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.   Procurement and Raw Materials\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 We purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2022, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2022, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 16% of PMI\u2019s global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States. We believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements.  Given the global reach of our value chain, properly managing land and water resources and utilizing a geographically diversified sourcing strategy for agricultural products are priorities as we seek to increase the resilience of our production systems and minimize operational risks. We conduct a global water risk assessment annually in tobacco-growing regions to identify potential hotspots for physical water risks that require adaptation measures. Our water stewardship strategy includes guidance for applying a landscape approach to water optimization projects, protecting natural resources and recharge areas, and improving the efficiency of irrigation systems to integrate better farm water management. These business practices are intended to mitigate the risk that climate change could influence weather patterns in ways that negatively impact the quality or cost of the agricultural products used to manufacture our products.  4 4 4    In addition to tobacco leaf, we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 360 suppliers. In 2022, our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 60% of our total direct materials purchases. The four most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units, as well as susceptors used for the TEREA heated tobacco units. In addition, the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our Indonesian business.  We discuss the details of our supply chain for our RRPs in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cItem 7\u201d) in Business Environment\u2014Reduced-Risk Products.  \u00a0Business Environment   Information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in Item 7, Business Environment to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \u00a0  Other Matters \u00a0 Customers     \u00a0 As described in more detail in \u201cDistribution & Sales\u201d above, in many of our markets we sell our products to distributors. In 2022, sales to a distributor in the European Union Region and a distributor in the East Asia & Australia Region each amounted to 10 percent or more of our consolidated net revenues.\u00a0See Item 8, Note 13. Segment Reporting for more information.  We believe that none of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\u00a0In some of our markets, particularly in the European Union, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and in the East Asia & Australia Regions, a loss of a distributor may result in a temporary market disruption.  \u00a0 Human Capital  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Our Workforce. At December\u00a031, 2022, including Swedish Match's employees, we employed approximately 79,800 people worldwide of more than 130 different nationalities, including full-time, temporary and part-time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business. We engage with legally recognized employee representative bodies and we have collective bargaining agreements in several of the countries in which we operate. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce.  We believe we maintain good relations with our employees and their representative organizations.   Our Internal Transformation. To be successful in our transformation to a smoke-free future, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent with our business needs, successfully integrate acquired businesses and innovate to become a truly consumer-centric business.  To achieve our strategic goals, we need to attract, retain and motivate the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, experience, competencies and skills.  Therefore, we strive to ensure the development of our existing talent while increasingly recruiting those with the expertise in areas that are relatively new to us such as digital and technical solutions. Our compensation and benefit programs are set at the levels that we believe are necessary to attract the best talent and remain competitive with other consumer product companies.  Oversight and Management. Our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") provides oversight of various matters pertaining to our workforce. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board is responsible for executive compensation matters and oversight of the risks and programs related to talent management. Our Code of Conduct highlights our commitment to ethical business conduct and honesty, respect, fairness in our ways of working.  Inclusion & Diversity. At PMI, we believe that a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture are strategic priorities which help fuel innovation and business success. As part of our commitment to workplace diversity, in 2020, our Chief Executive Officer appointed a Chief Diversity Officer. Improving gender balance, especially in management positions, continues to be one of our priorities:  \u2022In 2022, we achieved the global target of 40% female representation in management positions; \u2022In 2021, we started our Women in Leadership program to support our female talents; and \u2022We were the first multinational company to receive a global EQUAL-SALARY certification from the EQUAL-SALARY \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Foundation  in 2019. In 2022, we were re-certified as a global EQUAL-SALARY organization for the second time, verifying that PMI continues to pay female and male employees equally for equal work everywhere where we operate. This achievement is an important milestone toward the creation of a more inclusive gender-balanced workplace and the continuation of our reputation as a top employer.  5 5 5    In recognition of our efforts, we were again added to the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for transparency in gender reporting and advancing women\u2019s equity (among the 414 companies from 11 different sectors in 45 countries, who scored at or above the global threshold established by Bloomberg L.P.).   Creation of employee resource groups (\"ERGs\") was another important milestone to drive further inclusion at PMI. We believe these groups serve as a platform for building an enhanced sense of belonging, visibility, and greater understanding of different experiences and dimensions of diversity in our company. Currently, we have established global ERGs for race and ethnicity, LGBTQ+, gender and disability matters concerning our employees. Each global ERG is sponsored by a member of the PMI senior leadership team, to reinforce the fact that our strong commitment to Inclusion & Diversity comes from the top. In 2022, we continued to focus on the growth of our global ERGs and to expand them locally, to be able to meet the specific needs of different markets and regions.   By the end of 2022, our global parental leave principles were implemented in every market in which we operate, with the exception of Russia. PMI\u2019s minimum leave principles provide primary caregivers with a minimum of 18 weeks fully paid parental leave and secondary caregivers with a minimum of 8 weeks fully paid parental leave. These global and gender-neutral guidelines demonstrate how PMI is creating a more inclusive, diverse work environment to meet the challenges and expectations of our people for the 21st century workplace.  To further strengthen our commitment to drive inclusion and equality, we also commissioned an independent academic study  exploring the methods organizations can adopt to drive lasting cultural change. Findings of this study informed the development of practices and programs focused on employee inclusion at PMI.  Our Initiatives in Response to COVID-19. Since the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on business continuity, health and safety of our employees, and have adapted our ways of working to a new environment. We have implemented additional safety measures for essential employees in our facilities and offices. We have also enhanced remote and flexible work arrangements and digital collaboration, and related risk management, and to date, many of our employees continue to have the ability work remotely for up to 60% of their working time, where applicable.  Government Regulation    As a company with global operations in a heavily regulated industry, we are subject to multiple laws and regulations of jurisdictions in which we operate.  We discuss our regulatory environment in Item 7, Business Environment.    The regulatory landscape related to environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\u201d) matters is rapidly evolving. We closely monitor these developments and implement initiatives addressing PMI\u2019s priority ESG areas in line with our sustainability strategy. In particular, we are subject to international, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce our carbon footprint, wastage, as well as water and energy consumption. We report externally about our climate change mitigation strategy, together with associated targets and results in reducing our carbon footprint, through CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), the leading international non-governmental organization assessing the work of thousands of companies worldwide in the area of environmental impact, including climate change.   Our environmental and occupational health and safety management program includes policies, standard practices and procedures at all our manufacturing centers. Furthermore, we have engaged an external certification body to validate the effectiveness of this management program at our manufacturing centers around the world, in accordance with internationally recognized standards for safety and environmental management. Our subsidiaries expect to continue to make investments in order to drive improved performance and maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We assess and report to our management the compliance status of all our legal entities on a regular basis. Based on current regulations, the management and controls we have in place and our review of climate change risks (both physical and regulatory), environmental expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings or competitive position.  Based on current regulations, compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings, or competitive position.    As discussed in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives that could result in a significant decrease in demand for our brands or by climate-related regulations that increase our cost of operation. More specifically, any regulatory requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our RRPs, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a  6 6 6   material adverse effect on our financial results. Further, tightened climate-related regulation may lead to additional carbon taxation or energy price increases impacting our cost of operation. These shifts in regulation and other market trends could, amongst others, impact current deforestation rates. Availability of deforestation-free materials, could be impacted by increased demand for alternative energy sources and low-carbon fuels, such as biomass, which could result in increased sourcing costs.  We discuss additional information regarding regulatory matters relating to climate change in Item 7, Climate Change Laws and Regulations. \u00a0 Information About Our Executive Officers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    The disclosure regarding executive officers is hereby incorporated by reference to the discussion under the heading \u201cInformation about our Executive Officers as of February 10, 2023\u201d in Part III, Item\u00a010. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cItem 10\u201d).  Intellectual Property     Our trademarks are valuable assets, and their protection and reputation are essential to us. We own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands, including Marlboro, HEETS, IQOS, IQOS ILUMA, TEREA, and ZYN or have the right to use them in all countries in which these brands are advertised or sold. \u00a0 In addition, we have a large number of granted patents and pending patent applications worldwide. Our patent portfolio, as a whole, is material to our business. However, no one patent, or group of related patents, is material to us. We also have registered industrial designs, as well as unregistered proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other unregistered intellectual property rights. \u00a0 Effective January\u00a01, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with Philip Morris USA Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (\u201cPM USA\u201d). The Intellectual Property Agreement allocates ownership of jointly funded intellectual property as follows:  \u2022PMI owns all rights to jointly funded intellectual property outside the United States, its territories and possessions; and \u2022PM USA owns all rights to jointly funded intellectual property in the United States, its territories and possessions.  The parties agreed to submit disputes under the Intellectual Property Agreement first to negotiation between senior executives and then to binding arbitration.  An agreement reached with PM USA in 2022 relating to IQOS commercialization rights in the U.S. includes, among other things, an agreement relating to intellectual property rights consistent with the commercialization rights for relevant IQOS products.  Seasonality       \u00a0 Our business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality, although in certain markets cigarette consumption may be lower during the winter months due to the cold weather and may rise during the summer months due to outdoor use, longer daylight, and tourism.  \u00a0  Available Information\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 We are required to file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).
