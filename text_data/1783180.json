In connection with the Separation, we issued an aggregate principal balance of $11.0 billion of debt and transferred approximately $10.9 billion of cash to UTC on February 27, 2020 and March 27, 2020. In addition, we entered into several agreements with UTC and Otis Worldwide Corporation (\"Otis\") that govern various aspects of the relationship among us, UTC and Otis following the Separation and the Distribution. As of December 31, 2022, only the Tax Matters Agreement (\"TMA\") remains in effect. On April 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, we received cash contributions totaling $590 million from UTC related to the Separation.  Business Strategy  Our business strategy is to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions with a focus on providing differentiated, digitally-enabled lifecycle solutions to our customers. We believe our strategy is supported by a variety of favorable secular trends, including health and wellness, sustainability, digitalization and a growing middle class. In order to execute our business strategy, we are focused on three pillars of growth:  Strengthen and Grow our Core. Our strategy involves driving organic growth in part by maintaining our proven track record of innovation, which is focused on designing smarter, more connected and more sustainable systems and solutions. Our strategy also relies on our iconic, industry-leading brands and on strengthening our long-term relationships with channel partners and customers by offering solutions that anticipate customer needs with a focus on technologies related to environmentally-friendly refrigerants, energy efficiency, low emissions, air quality, electrification, noise reduction and safety. In addition, we continue to actively manage and strengthen our business and product portfolio to meet the current and future needs of our customers. This is driven by sustaining activities with a focus on improving existing products and reducing production costs. We also pursue potential acquisitions to complement existing products and services to enhance our product portfolio.   Increase Product Extensions and Geographic Coverage. Our strategy involves leveraging our global operations, the strength of our iconic, industry-leading brands and our success in creating valuable partnerships to focus on targeted expansion into new locations and channels where we believe that we can drive profitable growth. These drivers are supported by research and development activities with a focus on new product development and new technology innovation. We also pursue potential acquisitions to enter new locations and channels as well as expand and enhance our current product portfolio. In addition, we launched Carrier Ventures, a global venture capital group which focuses on investments to accelerate the development of sustainable innovations and disruptive technologies to transform future building and cold chain management. The group engages in strategic partnerships with high growth organizations as they invest in the development of technologies to innovate and commercialize the next generation of differentiated net zero solutions.  Grow Aftermarket and Digital. Our strategy is focused on digital capabilities to drive the evolution of our hardware in order to enable cloud connectivity, modernize legacy software and launch new platforms, products and services. We expect that these solutions will increase our total available market opportunity, enhance our predictive service and maintenance capabilities, strengthen our customer intimacy as well as fuel our aftermarket growth. Abound is a cloud-based building platform that unlocks and unites building data to create more healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent solutions for indoor spaces.

Our Lynx digital platform, developed in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), allows customers to leverage data to enhance visibility, resiliency, agility and efficiency in the cold chain to reduce loss and support real-time decisions. In addition, our product teams are deriving insights from data by employing AWS for connectivity, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Most recently, we signed a multi-year, strategic collaboration  5 5 5 Table of Contents      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 agreement with AWS to offer additional Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") solutions in the areas of HVAC performance, sustainability and safety and security. The collaboration is part of our growing investment in digitally-enabled lifecycle solutions designed to inspire confidence in the health and safety of indoor environments.   Our industry-leading global brands and track record of innovation form the foundation of our business strategy. This strategy is fueled by our position at the epicenter of important secular trends, including an emphasis on health and wellness, a growing focus on sustainability and increasing digitalization. Coupled with our focus on growth, innovation and operational efficiency, we expect to drive long-term growth and increased value for our shareowners.   Business Segments  We globally manage our business operations through three segments: HVAC, Refrigeration and Fire & Security. Each respective segment's major products, services and distribution methods are as follows:  HVAC. The HVAC segment provides products, controls, services and solutions to meet the heating, cooling and ventilation needs of residential and commercial customers while enhancing building performance, health, energy efficiency and sustainability.

Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole  Competitive Conditions  Each of our businesses is subject to significant competition from a number of companies throughout the world. Due to the nature of our products and services and the markets we serve, our competition can vary from regional or specialized companies to larger public or private companies.  The most significant competitive factors we face are technology differentiation, product performance, service, delivery schedule and price. Brand reputation, service to customers and quality are also important competitive factors for our products and services. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we are a significant competitor with respect to  6 6 6 Table of Contents      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 each of our major product and service offerings. We believe that the loss of any individual contract or customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results.  Raw Materials and Supplies  We rely on suppliers and commodity markets to secure components and raw materials such as copper, aluminum and steel. In addition, we also use semi-conductors and other electronic components in the manufacture of our products. To maximize our buying effectiveness and leverage our scale, we have a central strategic sourcing group that consolidates purchases of certain materials and components across our business segments.  The ongoing global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant challenges for global supply chains resulting in inflationary cost pressures, component shortages and transportation delays. As a result, we have incurred incremental costs for commodities and components used in our products as well as component shortages and higher freight costs that have negatively impacted our sales and results of operations. We expect that these challenges will continue to have an impact on our businesses for the foreseeable future.  We continue to take proactive steps to limit the impact of these challenges and are working closely with our suppliers to ensure availability of products and implement other cost savings initiatives. In addition, we continue to invest in our operations and supply chain to improve its resilience with a focus on automation, dual sourcing of critical components and localized manufacturing when feasible. To date, there has been moderate disruption to the availability of our products, though it is possible that more significant disruptions could occur if these supply chain challenges continue.  Intellectual Property  We maintain a broad portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our business to protect our research and development investments and to maintain our competitive advantages. We hold approximately 9,000 active patents and pending patent applications worldwide. From time to time, we take actions to protect our business by asserting our intellectual property rights against third-party infringement. We believe that we have taken reasonable measures to build and protect this portfolio of intellectual property rights, but we cannot be assured that these rights will not be challenged, found invalid or unenforceable.  Operating System  We plan to continue to foster operational, financial and commercial excellence to drive sales and earnings growth. With roots in our legacy manufacturing and business processes, the Carrier operating system \u2014 Carrier Excellence \u2014 is our continuous improvement framework that is expected to drive operational excellence across our businesses. Our Supplier Excellence program is intended to apply these same operating principles to our supply base and we continue to focus on strategic cost reductions through operational efficiency, digitalization, automation and supply chain productivity. These efforts have helped reduce the impact of inflationary pressures experienced during 2022 and 2021.  Joint Ventures and Strategic Relationships  Our joint ventures and strategic relationships are an important part of our business. We hold direct ownership interests in approximately 47 joint ventures, the financial results of which are accounted for by the equity method of accounting or the cost basis of accounting, of which 99% of such investments are in our HVAC segment. These relationships engage in distribution, manufacturing and product development activities and are integral to our business operations and growth strategy.   Seasonality  Demand for certain of our products and services is seasonal and can be impacted by weather conditions. For instance, sales and services of our HVAC products to residential customers have historically been higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, which represent the peak seasons for air conditioning-related sales in North America markets. A change in building and remodeling activity also can affect our financial performance. In addition, our financial performance may be influenced by the production and utilization of transport equipment, including truck production cycles in North America and Europe. 7 7 7 Table of Contents      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Compliance with the Regulation of our Business and Operations  We operate our businesses and sell our products all over the world. As a result, rapid changes in legislation, regulations and government policies, including with respect to regulations intended to combat climate change, affect our operations and business in the countries, regions and localities in which we operate and sell our products. International accords such as the Paris Agreement and the subsequent U.S. climate policies to meet its nationally determined contributions as well as local regulations in the U.S. reducing the use of fossil fuels in buildings all have the potential to impact our products and service offerings. Such changes, which can render our products and technologies non-compliant, involve refrigerants, noise levels, product and fire safety, hydrofluorocarbon emissions, fluorinated gases, hazardous substances and electric and electronic equipment waste. Increased fragmentation of regulatory requirements changes the manner in which we conduct our business and increases our costs because it necessitates the development of country or regional specific variants, monitoring of and compliance with those regulations and additional testing and certifications. In addition, our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulations promulgated by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and by authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, capital expenditures to design and upgrade our products to comply with or exceed environmental and other regulations and energy efficiency standards. However, it is our opinion that the costs related to compliance requirements for environmental or other government regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, financial results or competitive position.  Environmental Goals  As a leading global provider of healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent buildings and cold chain solutions, we are committed to making the world safer, sustainable and more comfortable. We have set ambitious environmental, social and governance goals to be reached by 2030, which include the following:  \u2022Invest over $2 billion to develop healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent buildings and cold chain solutions that incorporate sustainable design principles and reduce lifecycle impacts, \u2022Reduce our customers' carbon footprint by more than 1 gigaton, \u2022Achieve carbon neutral operations, \u2022Reduce energy intensity by 10% across our operations, \u2022Achieve water neutrality in our operations, prioritizing water-scarce locations, and  \u2022Promote sustainability through education, partnerships and climate resiliency programs.   Human Capital Management  As of December\u00a031, 2022, Carrier had approximately 52,000 employees worldwide, of which 39% are located in the Americas, 25% are located in EMEA and 36% are located in Asia. As of December\u00a031, 2022, in the U.S., approximately 66% of Carrier's approximately 5,000 production and maintenance employees were covered under six collective bargaining agreements that have expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2026. In the European Union, approximately 12,000 employees are represented by two European Works Councils and, at national and local levels, we inform and consult with 46 local works councils and with unions representing employees at approximately 40 sites. We believe that our relations with our labor unions and works councils are generally good.   We believe that our employees are our most important asset and that, in turn, our success and growth depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. We continuously evaluate, modify and enhance our recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives and measures form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies and initiatives.  Health & Safety. Our Environmental, Health and Safety program is focused on eliminating the risk of serious injuries, illness and fatalities to employees, contractors and customers during manufacturing, installation, servicing and other business activities. We apply rigorous standards, controls, inspections and audits to help ensure that our operations and premises comply with national and local regulations and Carrier incident reporting requirements. For 2022, our total recordable incident rate (\"TRIR\"), based upon the number of injuries per 200,000 hours worked for our employees was 0.31 and our lost time incident rate (\"LTIR\") was 0.12.   8 8 8 Table of Contents      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to COVID-19, we implemented various measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers including work-from-home requirements (where practical), social distancing and deep cleaning protocols at all of our facilities as well as travel restrictions, among other measures, which comply with applicable governmental regulations and guidance.   Competitive Pay, Benefits and Total Rewards and Practices. Carrier's total rewards philosophy is designed to align the compensation of our employees with individual and Company performance, and to provide the appropriate market-competitive incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. In addition, we offer a company-paid assistance program to help employees and their families with mental health and other life challenges. In coordination with each country\u2019s social welfare system, and in addition to any required local health care participation, we may provide additional health and welfare benefits depending on, among other things, the market competitiveness in that country. We also offer a tuition assistance program that is discussed in more detail below (see Talent Development and Employee Engagement).  Inclusion & Diversity. As of December\u00a031, 2022, approximately 29% of our employees and 30% of our executives globally were women. As of December\u00a031, 2022, people of color represented approximately 31% of our U.S. executive and 26% of our professional employees in the U.S.   Our greatest strength is the diversity of our people and their ideas and experiences; inclusion and diversity are the cornerstones of our values and we believe that it is a source of innovation. To this end, we continue to promote _belong, our inclusion and diversity philosophy and brand as well as an inclusion and diversity strategy that consists of four tenets \u2013 Reduce the Gap, Develop & Sponsor, Drive Inclusion and Lean Forward \u2013 which include a focus on recruitment, development and mentoring activities. We also sponsor multiple Employee Resource Groups (\"ERGs\"), such as Pride, Carrier Black Alliance, WE (Women's Empowerment at Carrier), CHEER (Carrier Hispanic & Latino Employee Engagement Resource group), UCAN (United Carrier Asian Network) and Military and Veterans. These ERGs operate with a formal leadership structure, a steering committee, senior leadership sponsorship and a defined mission statement that is aligned with supporting Carrier\u2019s business strategy. We also have established multi-year relationships with two historically Black colleges and universities to create programs to help students develop skills for the future and provide career and recruitment initiatives.  We continue to take steps to expand our role as an employer that champions inclusion, diversity and equality of opportunity. Carrier has pledged to achieve gender parity in senior leadership roles by 2030. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") has signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion TM pledge joining more than 2,000 CEOs to underscore our commitment to ensure inclusion is core to our business culture. Our senior management has also signed the Hispanic Promise, joining other Fortune 500 companies in the pledge to hire, retain and develop Hispanics in the workplace. Additionally, we continue to provide our global workforce with inclusion and diversity training with a focus on unconscious bias, micro-aggression and allyship.   While we recognize more work needs to be done, we are proud of the strides we have made and the recognition we have received in furthering our inclusion and diversity strategy. In 2021, Carrier participated for the first time in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2021 Corporate Equality Index and achieved a perfect score being recognized Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality. Carrier earned the same recognition in 2022. Carrier also participated for the first time in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index in Mexico and achieved a perfect score being recognized as Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality in Mexico.  Talent Development and Employee Engagement. We are committed to the continued development and engagement of our people. We promote continuous learning by offering a company-sponsored Employee Scholar Program, which covers the cost of an employee's tuition, academic fees and books at approved universities. We conduct annual leadership development reviews, a process through which senior leaders identify future leaders and discuss strengths and development opportunities, fostering succession planning for key leadership positions. We also have developed various talent development programs, such as internships, early career rotational programs and a suite of development programs for current and future leaders during the three critical stages of their careers \u2013 early career, mid-career and senior leadership.  Three-times per year we conduct a confidential online survey in local languages to solicit feedback from our employees. The results are reviewed by our senior leadership and shared with our managers and other employees who collaborate to act on identified areas of improvement.  9 9 9 Table of Contents      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corporate Information  Carrier was incorporated in Delaware in connection with the Separation on March 15, 2019.
