{"cik": 89800, "item_1A": "ITEM\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS Introduction The Sherwin-Williams Company, founded in 1866 and incorporated in Ohio in 1884, is engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers primarily in North and South America with additional operations in the Caribbean region, Europe, Asia and Australia.

Basis of Reportable Segments The Company reports its segment information in the same way that management internally organizes its business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources. The Company has three reportable operating segments: The Americas Group, Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group (individually, a \u201cReportable Segment\u201d and collectively, the \u201cReportable Segments\u201d). The Company reports all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the Administrative segment. For more information about the Reportable Segments, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  The Americas Group The Americas Group consisted of 4,931 company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean region at December\u00a031, 2022. Each store in this segment is engaged in servicing the needs of architectural and industrial paint contractors and do-it-yourself homeowners. These stores market and sell Sherwin-Williams\u00ae and other controlled brand architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, OEM product finishes and related products. The majority of these products are produced by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer Brands Group. In addition, each store sells select purchased associated products. In addition to our stores in the Latin America region, The Americas Group meets regional customer demands through developing, licensing, manufacturing, distributing and selling a variety of architectural paints, coatings and related products in North and South America. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the business of this segment.  Consumer Brands Group The Consumer Brands Group manufactures and supplies a broad portfolio of branded and private-label architectural paint, stains, varnishes, industrial products, wood finishes products, wood preservatives, applicators, corrosion inhibitors, aerosols, caulks and adhesives to retailers and distributors throughout North America, as well as in China and Europe. The Consumer Brands Group also supports the Company\u2019s other businesses around the world with new product research and development, manufacturing, distribution and logistics. Approximately 67% of the total sales of the Consumer Brands Group in 2022 were intersegment transfers of products primarily sold through The Americas Group. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private-label products is performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed through third-party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of the product. The Consumer Brands Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales and related profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company\u2019s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures at sites currently in operation. Performance Coatings Group The Performance Coatings Group develops and sells industrial coatings for wood finishing and general industrial (metal and plastic) applications, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings, coil coatings, packaging coatings and performance-based resins and colorants worldwide. This segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide. Sherwin-Williams\u00ae and other controlled brand products are distributed through The Americas Group and this segment\u2019s 317 company- 1 1 1 Table of Contents Table of Contents  operated branches and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third-party distributors. The Performance Coatings Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment.  Administrative Segment The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the Company\u2019s corporate headquarters site. Also included in the Administrative segment is interest expense, interest and investment income, certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmental-related matters and other expenses which are not directly associated with the Reportable Segments. The Administrative segment does not include any significant foreign operations. Also included in the Administrative segment is the operations of a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership, management, and leasing of non-retail properties held primarily for use by the Company, including the Company\u2019s headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Sales of this segment represent external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the Company in its primary businesses. Material gains and losses from the sale of property are infrequent and not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the Administrative segment. Raw Materials and Products Purchased for Resale Raw materials and products purchased for resale make up the majority of our consolidated cost of goods sold. Raw materials may vary considerably by the specific paint or coating being manufactured but can generally be divided into the following categories: resins and latex, pigments, additives, solvents, and metal or plastic containers. A significant portion of these raw materials are derived from various upstream petrochemical and related commodity feedstocks, notably propylene. Raw materials are sourced from multiple suppliers globally, typically within the geographic region where our products are being manufactured. A portion of specialized resins and other products are manufactured in house. We also purchase a variety of products for resale that are highly complementary to our paint and coating offerings, notably spray equipment and parts, floorcovering, and assorted sundries. We attempt, if feasible, to mitigate our potential risk associated with the sourcing of our raw materials and other products through inventory management, strategic relationships with key suppliers, alternative sourcing strategies and long-term investments to expand our manufacturing capabilities. See Item\u00a01A Risk Factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials.  Seasonality The majority of the sales for the Reportable Segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters. However, periods of economic downturn can alter these seasonal patterns. There is no significant seasonality in sales for the Administrative segment.  Working Capital In order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters, the Company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter. Working capital items (inventories and accounts receivable) are generally financed through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the Company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources, see the \u201cFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Cash Flow\u201d section in Item 7.  Trademarks and Trade Names Customer recognition of trademarks and trade names owned or licensed by the Company collectively contribute significantly to our sales. The major trademarks and trade names used by each of the Reportable Segments are set forth below. \u2022The Americas Group:\u00a0Sherwin-Williams\u00ae, A-100\u00ae, Builders Solution\u00ae, Captivate\u00ae, Cashmere\u00ae, Colorgin\u00ae, Condor\u00ae, Duration\u00ae, Emerald\u00ae, Kem Tone\u00ae, Latitude\u00ae, Loxon\u00ae, Metalatex\u00ae, Novacor\u00ae, Painters Edge Plus\u2122, ProClassic\u00ae, ProCraft\u00ae, Pro Industrial\u2122, ProMar\u00ae, SuperDeck\u00ae, SuperPaint\u00ae, Woodscapes\u00ae  \u2022Consumer Brands Group: Cabot\u00ae, Dupli-Color\u00ae, Dutch Boy\u00ae, Geocel\u00ae, HGTV HOME\u00ae by Sherwin-Williams, Huarun\u00ae, Krylon\u00ae, Minwax\u00ae, Purdy\u00ae, Ronseal\u00ae, Thompson\u2019s\u00ae WaterSeal\u00ae, Valspar\u00ae, White Lightning\u00ae  \u2022Performance Coatings Group: Sherwin-Williams\u00ae, Acrolon\u00ae, AcromaPro\u00ae, ATX\u00ae, DeBeer Refinish\u00ae, Duraspar\u00ae, EcoDex\u00ae, Envirolastic\u00ae, Excelo\u00ae, EzDex\u00ae, Fastline\u00ae, Firetex\u00ae, Fluropon\u00ae, Heat-Flex\u00ae, House of Kolor\u00ae, Huarun\u00ae, Inver\u00ae, Kem Aqua\u00ae, Lazzuril\u00ae, Macropoxy\u00ae, Martin Senour\u00ae, Matrix Edge\u00ae, M.L.

Backlog and Productive Capacity Backlog orders are not typically significant in the business of any Reportable Segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment. During 2022, we experienced raw material shortages and labor constraints that impacted our production and ability to meet customer orders. We believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products during 2023. Competition We experience competition from many local, regional, national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. We are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers, however, our competitive position varies for our different products and markets. In The Americas Group, competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment. In the Consumer Brands Group, domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and private-label paint and coatings products. Technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors for this segment. The Performance Coatings Group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others with niche products. Key competitive factors for this segment include technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price. The Administrative segment has many competitors consisting of other real estate owners, developers and managers in areas in which this segment owns property. The main competitive factors are the availability of property and price. Human Capital Resources The success of our business and ability to execute on our strategy depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain, develop and progress a diverse population of qualified employees at all levels of our organization. At December\u00a031, 2022, we employed 64,366\u00a0people worldwide, of which 75% were in the United States and 25% were in other global regions. Our commitment to our people is embedded in the Company\u2019s corporate purpose and guiding values. Through our purpose, we strive to inspire and improve the world by coloring and protecting what matters. Our employees are instrumental in fulfilling this purpose through the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of innovative paint and coatings products. The Company\u2019s seven guiding values \u2014 integrity, people, service, quality, performance, innovation and growth \u2014 drive how we fulfill our purpose, emphasize the importance of our global workforce and serve as the foundation of our culture of excellence.  We have developed key strategies, objectives and measures as part of the overall management of our business that support our global workforce and enable us to attract, retain, develop and progress top talent in a competitive labor market. These strategies, objectives and measures are advanced through programs, policies and initiatives focused on inclusion, diversity and equity (ID&E), talent acquisition and employee engagement, occupational health and safety and total rewards, which includes compensation and benefits programs and practices.  Inclusion, Diversity and Equity. We strive to foster a culture of inclusion and belonging where differences are welcomed, appreciated and celebrated to positively impact our people and business. Reflected in the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct and reinforced through our actions, training and attitudes, fostering an inclusive culture is a moral and business imperative. The building blocks of our ID&E strategy include: \u2022Educate and communicate to drive success: Building awareness of inclusive leadership behaviors to leverage the unique contributions of each employee to positively impact our people and business results. \u2022Fill the pipeline with the best talent: Attracting the best talent pool that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we serve and do business.  \u2022Develop and engage talent by investing in our people: Investing in our people by providing networking and learning opportunities to drive retention, progression and engagement. 3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents  \u2022Progress talent by embedding equity into talent planning: Embedding equity into talent practices, processes, tools and resources at all levels. Creating a supportive, welcoming environment across our global footprint is the shared responsibility of all employees, including our senior leaders. Each year, our senior leaders attend an ID&E education and training session to assist us in maintaining our commitment to leading with inclusion and leveraging the diversity of our workforce. During 2022, we held our annual CEO Forums on Inclusion, which are designed to encourage open discussions with employees that are led by our Chief Executive Officer and other senior leaders about opportunities to advance our culture of inclusion and belonging. We also continued our focus on driving allyship and empathy through conscious inclusion training across our global workforce and elevating the visibility and prominence of our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These voluntary, employee-led networks are organized around a shared underrepresented demographic, and membership spans across 250 chapters globally. ERGs bring together employees from various groups, divisions and functional teams to foster more inclusive workplaces, create greater synergy around business objectives and serve as a hub for professional development and mentorship opportunities that enable our employees to thrive and find long-term success at Sherwin-Williams. Talent Acquisition and Employee Engagement. Through our integrated talent management strategy, we strive to attract, retain, develop and progress a workforce that embraces our culture of inclusion and reflects our diversity efforts. This strategy connects major milestones in the employee journey, including talent acquisition, onboarding, performance management, leadership and management development, succession and career progression, and is supported by our focus on employee engagement, ID&E, workforce analytics and human resources information technology governance. The Company\u2019s early talent programs, including our management trainee program and similar programs across our global business, play a critical role in attracting, developing and advancing a diverse pipeline of talent. During 2022, we hired approximately 1,400 college graduates through our management trainee program as part of our long-term growth initiatives. We also partner with various colleges and universities, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-Serving Institutions, to attract women, underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, veterans and other candidates into the talent pipeline. We invest in our people by providing learning and employee networking opportunities, including through our ERGs, to drive retention, development and engagement and help employees excel in their current and future roles. During 2022, our employees completed thousands of hours of online and instructor-led courses across a broad range of categories, including leadership, ID&E, professional skills, technical and compliance. We measure our progress toward creating an inclusive culture that empowers employees to learn, grow and achieve their aspirations by conducting periodic pulse surveys and our global engagement survey, which we first conducted during 2021 and expect to conduct every other year. We are focused on using these survey results to drive continued progress with our efforts.  Occupational Health and Safety. Providing safe and healthy working environments for our employees is a core value. We have a consistent focus on Environmental, Health and Safety excellence that promotes employee health and safety, process safety, and occupational health, including evaluation and implementation of reasonable preventative measures to reduce workplace injuries and illness. We strive for incident-free workplaces \u2014 continuously assessing and improving the programs that are in place to help keep our employees, customers and communities safe.  Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented modifications throughout our business and health and safety programs designed to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers. These efforts have included, and may continue to include where necessary and appropriate, enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures and return to work protocols. These efforts also continue to include permitting remote, alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible to promote increased flexibility and support employee health and safety, while maintaining our focus on innovation, collaboration, and engagement. Total Rewards. We prioritize the fair, consistent and equitable treatment of our employees in relation to working conditions, wages, benefits, policies and procedures. The Company\u2019s policies and programs are designed to respond to the needs of our employees in a manner that provides a safe, professional, efficient and rewarding workplace. Our total rewards programs are designed to offer competitive compensation, comprehensive benefits and other programs to support employees\u2019 growth, both personally and professionally, and the diverse needs and well-being of our employees worldwide.  Over the past few years, we have enhanced certain of the Company\u2019s benefits and practices to support the health and well-being of our employees through the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges. Our enhanced benefits have included tele-health, paid sick leave, family leave and voluntary leave of absence policies and programs. We also have rewarded our employees\u2019 resiliency and hard work and made changes in our business to encourage retention, including through wage increases, reduced store hours and employee benefits enhancements. During 2022, we continued enhancing the benefits we provide to our employees, including by extending our employee assistance program to our global workforce. The program provides mental  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents  health and well-being, family, career, lifestyle, legal and financial resources, tools and services designed to support our employees across all aspects of their lives.
