The strategy is cascaded down through the organization with an emphasis on five key points:  \u2022Optimizing the Company\u2019s position as the industry\u2019s preferred provider by delivering exceptional value to customers; \u2022Treating employees fairly to retain the best organization; \u2022Driving innovation in all aspects of the business; \u2022Taking reasonable, well considered risks to grow the business; and \u2022Enhancing the communities in which the Company operates.  The Mohawk business strategy provides continuity for the Company\u2019s operating principles and ensures a focus on exceeding customer expectations.  Strengths  Market Position  Mohawk\u2019s fashionable and innovative products, successful participation in all sales channels, creative marketing tools and programs and extensive sales resources have enabled the Company to build market leadership positions in multiple geographies, primarily North America, Brazil, Europe, Russia and Australasia, as well as to export products to approximately 170 countries. In North America, Mohawk\u2019s largest marketplace, the Company has leveraged its brands, broad offering and award-winning merchandising to build strong positions across all product categories. In Europe and Russia, similar advantages have supported market leadership in ceramic tile, premium laminate and sheet vinyl. The Company also has established a strong position in the fast-growing LVT market in the U.S. and Europe following the 2015 acquisition of IVC and subsequent investments to expand production and capacity. The 2018 acquisition of Godfrey Hirst provided the Company with the largest market position in carpet in Australasia to complement the leading hard surface presence that the Company had grown through its earlier acquisitions of national distributors in both Australia and New Zealand. In 2018, the Company acquired Eliane, a leading ceramic tile manufacturer in Brazil, the world\u2019s third largest ceramic market. The Eliane brand is highly regarded for innovative design and strength in high-end porcelain floor and wall tile. The Company believes Eliane is Brazil\u2019s largest ceramic tile exporter.     4 4  4 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Table of Contents  Index to Financial Statements Product Innovation  Mohawk drives performance through innovation and process improvements across all product categories. In ceramic, this includes proprietary Reveal Imaging\u00ae printing that replicates the appearance of other surfaces, such as long planks with the visuals and texture of natural wood as well as tiles that mimic natural stone, cement, textiles and other alternatives. The Company has pioneered an innovative ceramic tile technology called StepWise\u2122 that is infused into our top-quality porcelain tile to significantly improve slip resistance. Given the frequent use of ceramic tile in kitchens and baths, the Company has also introduced numerous collections featuring antimicrobial treatment that becomes a permanent part of the product. In Italy and Russia, the Company manufactures large-scale porcelain slabs that replicate the look of stone but are harder and more durable. In addition to satisfying demand for their domestic markets, porcelain slabs produced in Europe are also exported to North America, where along with the Company\u2019s quartz countertop and natural stone slab offerings they provide customers with a comprehensive array of surface options. In carpet, the Company introduced the unique Air.o\u2122 unified soft surface collection that integrates a polyester pad into tufted carpet, offering consumers a hypoallergenic and moisture-resistant alternative to traditional carpet. The Company has also launched an innovative carpet backing called Recover\u2122 that is hypoallergenic, latex and VOC free and is easier to install and seam. The Company\u2019s exclusive fiber technologies include the proprietary bio-based SmartStrand\u00ae and its brand extensions that represented the first super-soft stain-resistant products on the market as well as the patented Continuum\u2122 process that adds bulk and softness to polyester fiber, differentiating the Company\u2019s products in this fast-growing component of the carpet market. These fiber advantages have been extended into the Company\u2019s rug production, as well, adding luxurious feel and performance enhancements to the Company\u2019s design leadership. In laminate, the Company\u2019s patented Uniclic\u00ae installation technology revolutionized the category and has been extended into the LVT and wood categories, as well. The Company continues to deliver new innovations such as unique HydroSeal\u2122 water-resistance that has extended the laminate category into kitchens and baths, more realistic visuals with GenuEdge\u00ae pressed bevel edges and surface embossing in register that precisely recreates the appearance of wood. As consumer preference for water-proof flooring has increased, the Company has introduced a propriety technology called WetProtect\u2122 that makes the joints of installed laminate and LVT water tight and prevents liquid spills from reaching the subfloor. This technology has been uniquely applied to wood flooring with UltraWood\u2122, which also features an advanced waterproof finish in addition to improved scratch, wear and dent resistance. The Company\u2019s vinyl offerings reflect significant investments in leading-edge technology that yield incredibly realistic reproductions of stone, wood and other materials with embossed finishes that create more realistic visuals. To complement the beauty of its LVT collections, the Company has also enhanced the performance of its premium rigid products with a solid stone-plastic composite core and an enhanced lacquer finish to provide a dent proof, scratch resistant surface that can withstand today\u2019s active family homes.   Operational Excellence  Mohawk\u2019s highly efficient manufacturing and distribution assets serve as the foundation for successful growth. By leveraging continuous process improvement and automation, the Company\u2019s operations drive innovation, quality and value.

In particular, the Company\u2019s capital investments have improved recently acquired businesses by upgrading their product offerings, expanding their distribution and improving their productivity. For seventeen years, Mohawk\u2019s training and development programs have been ranked among the best by Training magazine, and Forbes has designated Mohawk as one of the Best Large U.S. Employers.  Sustainability  Mohawk\u2019s sustainability strategy is founded on three pillars: Better for People, Better for the Planet, and Better for Performance. Through the Better for the People pillar, the Company focuses on employee engagement, health and wellbeing, workforce development, a Zero-Harm Workplace and community engagement initiatives. Highlights of this pillar include Mohawk Group\u2019s ArtLifting partnership working with artists with disabilities to include their designs in commercial flooring collections, and an extensive internal training initiative from the plant floor to the C-suite. In the U.S. and Mexico, the Company operates on-site, near-site or virtual Healthy Life Centers to assist employees and their eligible family members with management of chronic conditions as well as treatment of acute illness. Through the Better for the Planet pillar, Mohawk focuses on a climate-positive future through energy conservation, water restoration and product circularity, including waste reduction and responsible sourcing. The Company uses extensive recycled content in many of its products, including transforming billions of discarded plastic bottles annually to create polyester carpet fiber and millions of pounds of tires annually to produce decorative crumb rubber mats. The Company also produces energy through solar panels, windmills and a waste-to-energy program using scrap wood material. Through the Better for Performance pillar, the Company focuses on ESG governance, ethics and data security and privacy, including creating and maintaining ESG-related policies.

In 2021, the U.S. floor covering industry reported $33.7 billion in sales, up approximately 21.7% over 2020\u2019s sales of $27.7 billion.  In 2021, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on sales, were carpet and rugs (38.5%), resilient consisting of LVT, sheet vinyl and various other resilient categories (27.0%), wood (12.9%), ceramic tile (12.4%), stone (6.0%)\u00a0and laminate (3.2%). In 2021, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on square feet sold, were carpet and rugs (45.3%), resilient consisting of LVT, sheet vinyl and various other resilient categories (31.1%), ceramic tile (12.5%), wood (6.1%), laminate (3.5%) and stone (1.5%).\u00a0 Each of these categories is influenced by the residential and commercial construction and residential and commercial remodeling end-use markets. These markets are influenced by many factors including changing consumer preferences, consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, inflation, availability of credit, turnover in housing and the overall strength of the economy.  The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are product innovation, style, quality, price, performance technology and service. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important when competing among product lines. The Company actively seeks to differentiate its products in the marketplace by introducing innovative products with premium features that provide a superior value proposition. The Company\u2019s investments in manufacturing technology, computer systems and distribution network, as well as the Company\u2019s marketing strategies and resources, contribute to its ability to compete on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than price.  Global Ceramic  Globally, the ceramic tile industry is significantly fragmented. Certain regions around the world have established sufficient capacity to allow them to meet domestic needs in addition to exporting product to other markets where their design and/or technical advantages may drive consumer preferences. Some mature markets have seen industry consolidation driven by mergers and acquisitions; however, most markets are comprised of many relatively small manufacturers all working with similar technologies, raw materials and designs. During 2021, the estimated global capacity for ceramic tile was 197 billion square feet \u2013 up slightly from the prior year primarily due to increased production capacity in China \u2013 with selling prices varying widely based on many factors, including supply within the market, materials used, size, shape and design. While the Company operates ceramic manufacturing facilities in eight countries, the Company has leveraged advantages in technology, design, brand recognition and marketing to extend exports of its products to approximately 160 countries. As a result of this global sales strategy, the Company faces competition in the ceramic tile market from a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers, all of which compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers through multiple residential and commercial channels. The Company believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the world. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in specific markets, including the U.S., Europe and Russia, as well as maintaining leading positions in the Mexican and Brazilian markets. The Company has leveraged the advantages of its scale, product innovation and unique designs in these markets to solidify its leadership position, however the Company continues to face pressures in these markets from imported ceramic products as well as alternate flooring categories.  Flooring NA  The North American flooring industry is highly competitive, with an increasing variety of product categories, shifting consumer preferences, supply chain disruptions and pressures from imported products, particularly in the rug and hard surface categories. Based on industry publications, in 2021, the U.S. flooring industry had carpet and rug sales in excess of $13.0 billion out of the overall $33.7 billion market. Based on its 2021 net sales, the Company believes it is the largest producer of rugs and the second largest producer of carpet in the world. The Company differentiates its carpet and rug products in the marketplace through proprietary fiber systems, state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and unique styling as well as leveraging the strength of some of the oldest and best-known brands in the industry. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer and distributor of laminate flooring in the U.S., as well as the producer of the industry\u2019s first waterproof wood flooring. The Company\u2019s leading position in laminate flooring is driven by the strength of its premium brands as well as technical innovations such as water resistance, realistic visuals, beveled edges, deeply embossed in register surfaces and patented installation technologies. The U.S. resilient industry is highly competitive, and according to industry publications, grew more than 30.3% in 2021. Based on industry publications, in 2021, LVT, sheet vinyl and other various resilient categories generated sales of $9.1 billion out of the $33.7 billion total U.S. flooring market. The Company believes that it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of LVT and sheet vinyl in the U.S. The Company\u2019s sheet vinyl operations produce fiberglass backed products, which have proven more popular with consumers in the past several years due to superior performance and durability.  9 9  9 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Table of Contents  Index to Financial Statements Flooring ROW  The Company faces competition in the non-U.S. laminate, wood, LVT and sheet vinyl flooring business from a large number of domestic manufacturers as well as pressures from imports.
