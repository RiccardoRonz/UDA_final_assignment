Research equips executives and their teams from every function and across all industries with actionable, objective insight, guidance and tools. Our experienced experts deliver all this value informed by a combination of practitioner-sourced and data-driven research to help our clients address their mission critical priorities.  Conferences provides executives and teams across an organization the opportunity to learn, share and network. From our Gartner Symposium/Xpo series, to industry-leading conferences focused on specific business roles and topics, to peer-driven sessions, our offerings enable attendees to experience the best of Gartner insight and guidance.  Consulting serves senior executives leading technology-driven strategic initiatives leveraging the power of Gartner\u2019s actionable, objective insight. Through custom analysis and on-the-ground support we enable optimized technology investments and stronger performance on our clients\u2019 mission critical priorities.  The fiscal year of Gartner is the twelve-month period from January 1 through December 31. All references to 2022, 2021 and 2020 herein refer to the fiscal year unless otherwise indicated. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms \u201cGartner,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  MARKET OVERVIEW Enterprise leaders face enormous pressure to stay ahead and grow profitably amidst constant changes. Whether it is a digital transformation, a global health crisis, large-scale regulatory changes, or other unique challenges, business leaders today are facing significant disruptive changes. We believe that enterprises cannot be operationally effective unless they incorporate the right strategy, management and technology decisions into every part of their business. This requirement affects all business levels, functions and roles. Executives and their teams turn to Gartner for decision-making and execution guidance to achieve their mission critical priorities.  OUR SOLUTION We believe our combination of expert-led, practitioner-sourced and data-driven research steers clients toward the right decisions and actions on the issues that matter most. Organizations are overrun with data and information. Gartner helps eliminate this information chaos and provides clarity with actionable, objective insight. We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our differentiated intellectual capital. The foundation of our business model is our ability to create and distribute our proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published reports, interactive tools, facilitated peer networking, briefings and direct communications with executives and their teams; our conferences, including the Gartner Symposium/Xpo series; and consulting and advisory services.   PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and sources of value for our clients that lead to increased client spending on our research and advisory services, conferences and consulting services. A critical part of our long-term strategy is to increase business volume and penetration with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and insight. We also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client relationships, augment our sales capacity and expand into new markets around the world. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and services. In addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of our products and services.  3 3 3    Our principal products and services are delivered through our three business segments, as described below.  \u2022RESEARCH. Gartner delivers independent, objective advice to leaders across an enterprise through subscription services that include on-demand access to published research content, data and benchmarks, and direct access to a network of approximately 2,500 research experts located around the globe. Gartner research is the fundamental building block for all Gartner products and services. We combine our proprietary research methodologies with extensive industry and academic relationships to create Gartner products and services that address each role across an enterprise. Within the Research segment, Global Technology Sales (\u201cGTS\u201d) sells products and services to users and providers of technology, while Global Business Sales (\u201cGBS\u201d) sells products and services to all other functional leaders, such as human resources, supply chain, finance, and marketing.  Our research agenda is defined by clients\u2019 needs, focusing on the critical issues, opportunities and challenges they face every day. We are in steady contact with more than 15,000 distinct client enterprises worldwide. We publish tens of thousands of pages of original research annually, and our research experts had more than 460,000 direct client interactions in 2022. Our size and scale enable us to commit vast resources toward broader and deeper research coverage and to deliver insight to our clients based on what they need and where they are. The ongoing interaction of our research experts with our clients enables us to identify the most pertinent topics to them and develop relevant product and service enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users of our research. Our proprietary research content, presented in the form of reports, briefings, updates and related tools, is delivered directly to the client\u2019s computer or mobile device via our website and/or product-specific portals.  Clients normally sign subscription contracts that provide access to our research content and advisory services for individual users over a defined period. We typically have a minimum contract period of twelve months for our research and advisory subscription contracts and, at December 31, 2022, over 70% of our contracts were multi-year.  \u2022CONFERENCES. Gartner conferences are designed for information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) and business executives as well as decision makers looking to adapt and evolve their organizations through disruption and uncertainty, navigate risks and prioritize investments. Attendees experience sessions led by Gartner research experts, and the sessions include cutting-edge technology solutions, peer exchange workshops, one-on-one analyst and advisor meetings, consulting diagnostic workshops, keynotes and more. Our conferences also provide attendees with an opportunity to interact with IT and business executives from the world\u2019s leading companies. In addition to role-specific summits and workshop-style seminars, Gartner hosts the Gartner Symposium/Xpo series, including its unique, flagship IT Symposium/Xpo\u00ae, which is held at several locations worldwide annually. During 2022, Gartner successfully held 25 in-person and 16 virtual conferences with more than 60,000 attendees, including eight Symposiums/Xpos. In addition, during 2022 we hosted 350+ peer networking meetings, and through the Evanta brand we hosted 350+ exclusive C-level meetings with close to 200 in-person.  \u2022CONSULTING. Through its experienced consultants, Gartner Consulting serves chief information officers and other senior executives who are driving technology-related strategic initiatives to optimize technology investments and drive business impact. Gartner Consulting combines the power of Gartner\u2019s market-leading research with custom analysis and on-the-ground support to help clients to turn insight and advice into action and impact.  Consulting solutions capitalize on Gartner assets that are invaluable to IT decision-making, including: (1) our extensive research, which ensures that our consulting analyses and advice are based on a deep understanding of the IT environment and the business of IT; (2) our market independence, which keeps our consultants focused on our clients\u2019 success; and (3) our market-leading benchmarking capabilities, which provide relevant comparisons and best practices to assess and improve performance. Additionally, we provide actionable solutions for a range\u00a0of IT-related priorities, including IT cost optimization, digital transformation and IT sourcing optimization.  COMPETITION  We believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are as follows:  \u2022Superior research content - We believe that we create the broadest, highest-quality and most relevant research coverage across all major functional roles in an enterprise. Our independent operating model and research analysis generates unbiased insight that we believe is timely, thought-provoking and comprehensive, and that is known for its high quality, independence and objectivity.  4 4 4   \u2022Our leading brand name - We have provided critical, trusted insight under the Gartner name for more than 40 years.  \u2022Our global footprint and established customer base - We have a global presence with clients in approximately 90 countries and territories on six continents. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the United States.  \u2022Insight that creates connections - Our global community of experts, analysts and peers help provide the deep relationships that help clients stay ahead of the curve.  \u2022Experienced management team - Our management team is comprised of research veterans and experienced industry executives with long tenure at Gartner.  \u2022Substantial operating leverage in our business model - We can distribute our intellectual property and\u00a0expertise across multiple platforms, including research and advisory subscription and membership programs, conferences and consulting engagements, to derive incremental revenue and profitability.  \u2022Vast network of research experts and consultants - As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,500 research experts and 880 experienced consultants located around the world. Our research experts are located in more than 30 countries and territories, enabling us to cover vast aspects of business and technology on a global basis.  Notwithstanding these differentiating factors, we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services. We compete indirectly with consulting firms and other data and information providers, including electronic and print media companies. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. While we believe the breadth and depth of our research positions us well versus our competition, increased competition could result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing, and increased sales and marketing expenditures.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  Our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. We have policies related to confidentiality, ownership, and the use and protection of Gartner\u2019s intellectual property. We also enter into agreements with our employees and third parties as appropriate that protect our intellectual property, and we enforce these agreements if necessary. We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify, create and protect it. Additionally, we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by our end users.  HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  We believe our people are our most valuable asset, enabling our long track record of global growth. From attracting diverse talent through our recruitment process, to cultivating that talent with learning and development opportunities and rewards for strong performers, to supporting overall wellness with meaningful benefits and engagement, we strive to put our people first. At December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 19,500 employees globally, approximately 9,110 of which were outside of the U.S., and the overwhelming majority of our employees were full time.  Gartner is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all applicants and employees without regard to any legally protected status. This commitment is formalized in our global and U.S. equal employment opportunity policies. We continually renew this commitment by seeking to optimize our recruitment and professional development processes, create networking and educational opportunities, celebrate heritage and history, celebrate community service, and create safe spaces for all employees. Our human capital management strategies are developed by executive management and overseen by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  Gartner is committed to creating a culture of inclusion - which is critical to the objectivity and independence we provide our clients. We celebrate diversity of thought and we welcome and encourage diverse perspectives. We embed Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) concepts into our culture and our critical people processes. Our DEI efforts are all about building the confidence and conviction in all of our associates \u2013 but particularly in our leaders - to do the right things and building a  5 5 5   language of inclusion to foster this. Our DEI Executive Council, composed of our CEO, Chief Human Resources Officer, CFO, General Counsel, head of DEI, and other selected leaders, drives diversity, equity and inclusion as an imperative at all levels of the organization. In addition, the DEI Center of Excellence operationalizes strategy and establishes goals against key metrics to drive greater transparency and accountability. Our teams of employees are composed of individuals from different geographies, cultures, religions, ethnicities, races, genders, sexual orientations, abilities and generations working together to solve problems. Currently, 33% of our Board of Directors and 23% of our executive management team identifies as female, and 25% of our Board of Directors identifies as racially or ethnically diverse. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 47% of our employees worldwide identified as female and 24% of employees in the U.S. identified as racially or ethnically diverse. On a worldwide basis, our employees were represented by more than 85 self-identified nationalities working in 38 different countries and territories.  We emphasize the importance of inclusion to leaders and managers and the value of fostering a sense of belonging within their teams. We also continue to invest in learning opportunities to develop DEI at Gartner. For example, in addition to our popular Embracing Diversity & Being Inclusive training module, which covers the importance of diversity and inclusion at Gartner and the role of unconscious bias, we added a new module this year called Equity vs. Equality, which focuses on fostering a more equitable workplace.   The Company supports a number of employee-driven Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) that bring employees together to foster a diverse, inclusive and supportive workplace. Gartner currently has six formal ERGs supporting underrepresented racial, ethnic and multicultural backgrounds, women, the LGBTQ+ community, veterans and employees with disabilities. Participation in ERGs is voluntary and open to all employees. In 2022, over 5,300 Gartner associates were members of at least one ERG.  Health, Safety and Compensation  We seek to invest in meaningful, innovative and inclusive compensation and benefit programs that support physical, financial and emotional well-being of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, 401(k) matching, healthcare and insurance benefits, tax savings programs, such as health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, health savings account and pretax commuter benefits, generous paid time off, paid parental leave, life and disability insurance, business travel accident insurance, charity matching, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers, among others. We believe that our equity grants facilitate retention as well as encourage performance of key personnel.   We operate under a hybrid virtual-first working arrangement, which provides additional flexibility to employees, enabling most of our employees to work remotely a substantial portion of the time. We also provide a number of free mental and behavioral health resources, including access to the Employee Assistance Program for employees and their dependents.  Talent Development, Retention and Training  Gartner aims to foster a culture of lifelong learning, getting feedback and evolving. In addition to helping employees unlock their full potential through mechanisms like continuous feedback and performance appraisals, we have dedicated programs designed to develop effective leaders. We also offer rotational programs and an online learning experience platform for employees called GartnerYou. In 2022, GartnerYou offered more than 46,000 learning resources, with over 400,000 completions globally. Since our Sales and Research & Advisory teams make up approximately 50% of total employees worldwide, we also have formal, dedicated programs to help train and onboard new hires as well as more experienced managers and leaders within Sales and Research & Advisory. In 2021, Gartner transformed how we onboard new sales hires so they more quickly develop the core competencies tied to sales success. Rooted in learning and development best practices, the reimagined program operates in a scalable model that provides new sales hires in their first year with access to as many as 2,100 well-paced, just-in-time learning assets. In 2022, we expanded the program, and more than 3,100 sales associates participated. Through these programs, we believe our teams develop role-specific knowledge and skills, increase productivity and improve performance.  We also strive to develop an inclusive and engaging environment that makes Gartner a vibrant, exciting place to work. We believe the greatest catalyst to engagement comes from leadership \u2014 particularly their efforts to set direction, allocate resources, and build individual and organizational capability. We embed our associate survey efforts within our business units so that the insight we glean can help leaders understand the opportunities for effecting organizational growth. Business-unit-specific survey results are used for a number of leader-specific interventions, from individualized coaching to team-based skill-building to business-unit-wide initiatives targeting key areas of engagement. While we experienced a decrease in associate turnover in 2022, our average employee tenure decreased from 5.1 years in 2021 to 4.5 years in 2022, primarily due to increased new hires in 2022. 6 6 6    Our Communities and the Environment  Our associates have a long history of individual and team volunteering. Gartner facilitates a charity match program. In 2022, over 19% of associates made matched donations to more than 3,600 nonprofits, amounting to over $7.1\u00a0million donated by Gartner and its associates. In 2022, Gartner associates also logged approximately 24,300 hours supporting over 580 nonprofit organizations around the world. Finally, in 2022, we announced our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 in accordance with Science Based Target initiative\u2019s (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard.
