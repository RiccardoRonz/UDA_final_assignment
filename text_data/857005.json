{"cik": 857005, "item_1A": "ITEM 1. Business Our Business PTC is a global software company that provides a portfolio of innovative digital solutions that work together to transform how physical products are engineered, manufactured, and serviced. Our software portfolio includes award-winning offerings that enable companies to author product data (our computer-aided design (CAD) portfolio solutions) and to manage product data and orchestrate processes (our product lifecycle management (PLM) portfolio solutions). Our software can be delivered on premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid model. Our customers include some of the world's most innovative companies in the aerospace and defense, automotive, electronics and high tech, industrial machinery and equipment, life sciences, retail and consumer products industries. We generate revenue through the sale of subscriptions, which include term-based on-premises software licenses and related support, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and hosting services; perpetual licenses; support for perpetual licenses; and professional services (consulting, implementation, and training). Recent Developments We acquired the ServiceMax\u00ae cloud-native field service management business in Q2\u201923, broadening our PLM solution set to encompass the service phase of the product lifecycle. We paid the first purchase payment installment of $835 million, as adjusted for working capital, indebtedness, cash, and transaction expenses, in January 2023, and the second and final installment of $650 million in October 2023. Refer to Note 6. Acquisitions and Disposition of Businesses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion about the ServiceMax transaction. 1 Table of Contents Our Strategy We pursue multiple strategic initiatives designed to create value for our customers, increase our Annual Run Rate (ARR) and free cash flow, and deliver long-term value for stockholders. \u00a0 Subscription Business Model \u00a0 Our transition from a perpetual and maintenance model to a subscription business model continues to be key to driving growth. Our subscription model offers greater benefits of scale and growth potential, drives higher customer engagement and retention, and provides better business predictability, with over 90% of our annual revenues being recurring in nature. This, in turn, enables us to make steady and sustained investments to pursue mid-to-long-term growth opportunities. Customer Expansion   Our solutions portfolio encompasses the entire product life cycle, from design to manufacture to service, enabling companies to adopt a \u201cdigital thread\u201d strategy to drive innovation and productivity. A digital thread manages product data and makes it accessible and useful to the right people, at the right time, and in the right context. The digital thread is particularly valuable for customers with complex products that tend to have longer life cycles. We seek to drive value for our customers by offering new and enhanced features and products that enable our customers to pursue and expand their digital thread strategies.   Our acquisition strategy targets companies with products that complement ours and that we believe will appeal to our existing customer base, allowing us to pursue cross-selling opportunities. The addition of ServiceMax in 2023 for the SLM part of our PLM portfolio further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle. The addition of Codebeamer in 2022 for the ALM part of our PLM portfolio strengthened our offerings in the ALM space as software becomes integral to more and more products, especially in regulated industries where traceability is safety-critical.   PLM Expansion   PLM is at the heart of digital transformation and has become essential technology at industrial companies. No longer confined to the Engineering department, PLM data is driving decision-making across organizations, enabling them to improve how products are designed, manufactured, and serviced.    Our goal is to be the category leader in PLM and to provide our customers with best-in-class solutions to drive innovation and productivity.   SaaS Transition   We continue to invest in the transformation of our technology portfolio to include more SaaS offerings. Our acquisitions of Onshape, Arena, and ServiceMax brought cloud-native solutions to our portfolio, and we continue to work towards creating and expanding SaaS offerings for our existing products. We believe that SaaS products represent a strong value proposition for our customers, offering reduced complexity; lower costs to implement, upgrade and administer; better user collaboration and mobility; and scalability. This is a longer-term strategy as we expect that SaaS adoption in the CAD and PLM markets will be gradual at first, then accelerate significantly, given constraints such as the length and cost of conversion projects and budgeting timelines of our customers. 2 Table of Contents Our Principal Products and Services Our Principal Product Groups PLM Software Products For Product Data Management and Process Orchestration \u00a0 CAD Software Products For Product Data Authoring PLM \u00a0 Our Windchill\u00ae PLM application suite manages all aspects of the product development lifecycle\u2014from concept through service and retirement\u2014by enabling a digital thread of product parts, materials, and configuration information.

Environmental Sustainability At PTC, we\u2019re motivated to become an impactful contributor to the dematerialization and decarbonization of global manufacturing. While we have a climate action plan committed to reduce our company\u2019s \u201cfootprint,\u201d we believe far larger benefits will flow from our \u201chandprint\u201d stemming from our software offerings. Our software solutions enable manufacturers to design, build, and service their products more sustainably. Footprint  In 2023, we announced our footprint reduction commitment via the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) and submitted near-term and net-zero targets for validation by SBTi. Our submitted near-term commitment is to reduce combined Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned/controlled operations) and Scope 2 (indirect energy use) emissions by 50% and reduce Scope 3 - Category 1 (Purchased Goods and Services) 25% compared to our 2022 baseline by 2030. Our long-term net-zero commitment is to reach net-zero across all scope emissions by 2050, with absolute reductions of over 90% across Scopes 1-3, with accredited carbon removal offsets for the remaining <10% as needed. While we await SBTi approval of our near-term and net-zero targets, we have already begun to implement programs and pursue initiatives to reduce our emissions and carbon footprint, including:  \u2022prioritizing energy efficiency and accessibility to public transportation when selecting office space;  prioritizing energy efficiency and accessibility to public transportation when selecting office space;  \u2022increasing our subsidy for employee\u2019s public transportation commute costs; and  increasing our subsidy for employee\u2019s public transportation commute costs; and  \u2022consolidating our data center operations with providers committed to mid-decade 100% renewable energy and advancing circular outcomes. consolidating our data center operations with providers committed to mid-decade 100% renewable energy and advancing circular outcomes.
