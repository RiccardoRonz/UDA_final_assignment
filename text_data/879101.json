{"cik": 879101, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business \u00a0 Overview \u00a0 The Company\u00a0is North America\u2019s largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, and a growing portfolio of\u00a0mixed-use assets.\u00a0The Company\u2019s mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders. \u00a0 The Company began operations through its predecessor, The Kimco Corporation, which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders. In 1973, these principals formed the Company as a Delaware corporation, and, in 1985, the operations of The Kimco Corporation were merged into the Company. The Company completed its initial public stock offering (the \u201cIPO\u201d) in November 1991, and, commencing with its taxable year which began January 1, 1992, elected to qualify as a REIT in accordance with Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet several organizational and operational requirements, and is required to annually distribute at least 90% of its net taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, the Company will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income, including any net capital gains.\u00a0 In January of 2023, the Company consummated the Reorganization into an UPREIT structure as described in the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this Annual Report.\u00a0 If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company, generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined in the Code. The Company maintains certain subsidiaries that made joint elections with the Company to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d), that permit the Company to engage through such TRSs in certain business activities that the REIT may not conduct directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state taxes on its income, and the Company includes a provision for taxes in its consolidated financial statements. In 1994, the Predecessor reorganized as a Maryland corporation. In March 2006, the Predecessor was added to the S&P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap companies, most of which are U.S. corporations. The Company's common stock, Class L Depositary Shares and Class M Depositary Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) under the trading symbols \u201cKIM\u201d, \u201cKIMprL\u201d, and \u201cKIMprM\u201d, respectively. \u00a0 The Company is a self-administered REIT and has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisors in connection with the operation of its properties. The Company\u2019s ownership interests in real estate consist of its consolidated portfolio and portfolios where the Company owns an economic interest, such as properties in the Company\u2019s investment real estate management programs, where the Company partners with institutional investors and also retains management. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       3\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       3\n     \n\n \n\n       3\n     \n \n       3\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 The Company began to expand its operations through the development of real estate and the construction of shopping centers but revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition and redevelopment of existing shopping centers that include a grocery component. The Company also expanded internationally within Canada, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Peru, but has since exited all international investments. Additionally, the Company developed various residential and mixed-use operating properties and continues to obtain entitlements to embark on additional projects of this nature through re-development opportunities. In August 2021, the Company expanded through a merger with Weingarten Realty Investors (\u201cWeingarten\u201d), whereby Weingarten merged with and into the Predecessor, with the Predecessor\u00a0continuing\u00a0as the surviving public company (the \u201cMerger\u201d), pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) between the Predecessor and Weingarten which was entered into on April 15, 2021. The Merger brought together two industry-leading retail real estate platforms with highly complementary portfolios and created the preeminent open-air shopping center and mixed-use real estate owner in the country. The Merger further enhanced the Company\u2019s portfolio in coastal and sun belt regions. \u00a0 The Company has implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs, in which the Company has noncontrolling interests. The Company earns management fees, acquisition fees, disposition fees as well as promoted interests based on achieving certain performance metrics. \u00a0 In addition, the Company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company has also provided preferred equity capital to real estate professionals and, from time to time, provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management\u2019s judgment, priced below the value of the underlying assets, however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets. \u00a0 As described in greater detail in the Explanatory Note to this Form 10-K, (i) on January 1, 2023, as a result of the Reorganization, the Parent Company, a Maryland corporation, became the successor issuer to the Predecessor, and (ii) on January 3, 2023 the Predecessor converted into Kimco OP, a limited liability company, organized in the State of Delaware. Parent Company is the managing member of Kimco OP and\u00a0owns 100% of the limited liability company interests, and exercises exclusive control over Kimco OP. \u00a0 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had interests in 532 shopping center properties (the \u201cCombined Shopping Center Portfolio\u201d), aggregating 90.8 million square feet of gross leasable area (\u201cGLA\u201d), located in 28 states. In addition, the Company had 23 other property interests, primarily through the Company\u2019s preferred equity investments and other investments, totaling 5.7 million square feet of GLA. \u00a0 Economic Conditions \u00a0 The economy continues to face several issues including the lack of qualified employees, inflation risk, supply chain issues and new COVID-19\u00a0variants, which could impact the Company and its tenants.\u00a0In response to the rising rate of inflation the Federal Reserve has steadily increased interest rates, and may continue to increase interest rates, until the rate of inflation begins to decrease. These increases in interest rates could adversely impact the business and financial results of the Company and its tenants. In addition, slower economic growth and the potential for a recession could have an adverse effect on the Company and its tenants. This could negatively affect the overall demand for retail space, including the demand for leasable space in the Company\u2019s properties. As a result, the Company could feel pricing pressure on rents that it is able to charge to new or renewing tenants, such that future rents and rent spreads could be negatively impacted. Any of these events could materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The Company continues to monitor economic, financial, and social conditions\u00a0and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators. If the Company determines that any of its assets are impaired, the Company would be required to take impairment charges, and such amounts could be material. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       4\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       4\n     \n\n \n\n       4\n     \n \n       4\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Business Objective and Strategies \u00a0 The Company has developed a strong nationally diversified portfolio of open-air, shopping centers located in drivable first-ring suburbs primarily within 19 major metropolitan sun belt and coastal markets, which are supported by strong demographics, significant projected population growth, and where the Company perceives significant barriers to entry.\u00a0 As of December 31, 2022, the Company derived 85% of its annualized base rent from these top major metro markets. The Company\u2019s shopping centers provide essential, necessity-based goods and services to the local communities and are primarily anchored by grocers, home improvement, and pharmacy. \u00a0 The Company\u2019s focus on high-quality locations has led to significant opportunities for value creation through the reinvestment in its assets to add density, replace outdated shopping center concepts, and better meet changing consumer demands.\u00a0 In order to add density to existing properties, the Company has obtained multi-family entitlements for 8,818 units of which 2,218 units have been constructed as of December 31, 2022. The Company continues to place strategic emphasis on live/work/play environments and in reinvesting in its existing assets, while building shareholder value. This philosophy is exemplified by the Company\u2019s Signature SeriesTM properties which include key value creation projects in our portfolio that exemplify our transformation and highlight our focus on quality, concentration around core MSAs, and growth through redevelopment and development opportunities. Signature Series properties also include fully entitled, shovel-ready mixed-use projects, and opportunities that we continue to identify and entitle as we seek to achieve the highest and best use of our real estate, enhance our communities, and create value for our stakeholders for years to come. \u00a0 The strength and security of the Company\u2019s balance sheet remains central to its strategy.\u00a0 The Company\u2019s strong balance sheet and liquidity position are evidenced by its investment grade unsecured debt ratings (Baa1/BBB+) by two major ratings agencies.\u00a0 The Company maintains one of the longest weighted average debt maturity profiles in the REIT industry, now at 9.5 years.\u00a0 The Company expects to continue to take steps to reduce leverage, unencumber assets and improve its debt coverage metrics as mixed-use projects and redevelopments continue to come online and contribute additional cash flow growth. \u00a0 Business Objective \u00a0 The Company\u2019s primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, and a growing portfolio of\u00a0mixed-use assets, in the U.S. The Company believes it can achieve this objective by: \u25cf increasing the value of its existing portfolio of properties and generating higher levels of portfolio growth; \u25cf increasing cash flows for reinvestment and/or for distribution to shareholders while maintaining conservative payout ratios; \u25cf improving debt metrics and upgraded unsecured debt ratings \u25cf continuing growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers, primarily focused on grocery anchors; and \u25cf increasing the number of entitlements for residential use. \u00a0 Business Strategies \u00a0 The Company believes with its strong core portfolio and its recent acquisitions, it will continue to achieve higher occupancy levels, increased rental rates and rental growth in the future. To effectively execute the Company\u2019s strategy and achieve its strategic goals the Company identified the following growth components to focus on: \u00a0 \n The Company believes it is well positioned for sustainable growth with its high-quality portfolio, accretive and opportunistic capital allocation, financial strength and environmental, social and governance leadership.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n       5\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       5\n     \n\n \n\n       5\n     \n \n       5\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n The Company has identified the following areas where it is well positioned for sustainable growth in the future. \u00a0 \n \u00a0 The Company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base. As of December 31, 2022, no single open-air shopping center accounted for more than 1.3% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest, or more than 1.4% of the Company\u2019s total shopping center GLA. Furthermore, at December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s single largest tenant represented only 3.7%, and the Company\u2019s five largest tenants aggregated less than 11.4%, of the Company\u2019s annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. \u00a0 As one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and the nation's largest owners and operators of open-air shopping centers, the Company has established close relationships with major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts. Management is associated with and/or actively participates in many shopping center and REIT industry organizations. Notwithstanding these relationships, there are numerous regional and local commercial developers, real estate companies, financial institutions and other investors who compete with the Company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the Company\u2019s properties. \u00a0 Government Regulation \u00a0 Compliance with various governmental\u00a0regulations\u00a0has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material.\u00a0We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental\u00a0regulations\u00a0that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and\u00a0regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and\u00a0regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and\u00a0regulations, local zoning, usage and other\u00a0regulations\u00a0relating to real property and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. \u00a0 In addition, see Item 1A.\u00a0Risk Factors\u00a0for a discussion of material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, relating to governmental\u00a0regulations, and see \u201cItem 7.\u00a0Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental\u00a0regulations\u00a0may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       6\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       6\n     \n\n \n\n       6\n     \n \n       6\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n Human Capital Resources \u00a0 The Company believes that our associates are one of our strongest resources and that a variety of perspectives and experiences found in a diverse workforce spark innovation and enrich company culture. The Company is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion best practices in all phases of the associate life cycle, including recruitment, training and development and promotion. By cultivating high levels of associate satisfaction and improving the diversity of our team, management\u2019s goal is to ensure the Company will remain a significant driving force in commercial real estate well into the future. \u00a0 The Company has been and will continue to be an equal opportunity employer committed to hiring, developing, and supporting a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace.\u00a0 To ensure full implementation of this equal employment policy, we take steps to ensure that persons are recruited, hired, assigned and promoted without regard to race, creed, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, religion, age, color, sex, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions), gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations.\u00a0 All of our employees must adhere to a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required, regular internal training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of discrimination and/or retaliation. \u00a0 To attract and retain high performing individuals, we are committed to partnering with our associates to provide opportunities for their professional development and promote their health and well-being.\u00a0We offer a broad range of benefits, and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. Our benefits programs include a robust offering of medical, dental, vision, life, disability and a number of exciting ancillary benefits, all of which require very low associate contributions or are offered at no cost to associates. The Company also provides a Safe Harbor 401(k) program with both pretax and Roth offering including a robust, fully vested matching contribution. \u00a0 The Company has been recognized as a Great Place to Work\u00ae for five consecutive years as well as a One of the 2022 Best Workplaces in Real Estate\u2122, both of which are based on anonymous third-party surveys and feedback collected from our associates. Additionally, the Company was designated a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality and has achieved a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index, a nationally recognized benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. \u00a0 The Company operates under a hybrid work model, which balances associates\u2019 need for valuable face-to-face interactions with individual preferences for ideal work conditions. By continuing to focus on communication, collaboration, and innovation, and by encouraging associates to protect their personal time and be deliberate in where and how they choose to work, management is confident that the model results in a happier, engaged, and more efficient workforce. \u00a0 The Company\u2019s executive and management team promotes a true \u201copen door\u201d environment in which all feedback and suggestions are welcome. Whether it be through regular all employee calls, department meetings, frequent training sessions, Coffee Connections with the executive team, use of our BRAVO recognition program, awarding of iPads for Ideas, or participation in our LABS (Leaders Advancing Business Strategy) program, associates are encouraged to be inquisitive and share ideas. Those ideas have resulted in a number of programs and benefit enhancements. \u00a0 The Company promotes physical health, including access to a national gym membership program for associates and their family members as well as host to regular wellness and nutrition seminars and health screenings. The Company also feels it is important that our associates are engaged and active in the community. Across our numerous offices, associates host volunteer and social activities. Whether we\u2019re participating in walks, runs, food or toy drives, the Company promotes and supports associate volunteerism with two volunteer days off per year and a company matching program in support of each associates charitable endeavors. The Company also encourages associates to directly drive strategy around the Company\u2019s environmental, social and governance initiatives through participation in five associate-driven KIMunity Councils focused in the areas of diversity, equity and inclusion, giving, wellness, sustainability, and tenant engagement. \u00a0 The Company recognizes the importance of advanced education. Each year, the Company funds $100,000 in college scholarships to benefit the children of our associates. In addition, the Company recently announced, in partnership with ICSC, it is providing $100,000 in scholarships to students wishing to pursue careers in real estate, of which no less than 50% will be awarded to students of under-represented groups. Both programs are managed by independent third parties who consider an equal balance of academics and financial need as determining factors. \u00a0 The Company's executive offices are located at 500 North Broadway, Suite 201, Jericho, NY 11753, a mixed-use property that is wholly owned by the Company, and its telephone number is (516) 869-9000 or 1-800-764-7114.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Company's efforts with regard to the Company's ESG matters. \u00a0 The Company recognizes that climate change is one of the most significant stakeholder issues of our times, threatening the viability of economic and environmental systems globally. The scientific community has studied climate change and a consensus exists that warming is occurring outside the boundaries of historical planetary trends due in significant part, to human activity. As a real estate portfolio owner, the Company monitors physical and transition risks as well as opportunities posed to its business by climate change and quantifies and discloses the climate impacts of its activities. \u00a0 The Company\u2019s science-based GHG emissions reduction goals are aligned with the Paris Climate Accord and while there can be no guarantees, we believe they could \u00a0put the Company on pace to achieve Scope 1 and Scope 2 net zero GHG emissions by 2050. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       9\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       9\n     \n\n \n\n       9\n     \n \n       9\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Climate risks and opportunities are generally evaluated at both the corporate and individual asset level. The following table summarizes relevant climate risks identified as a part of the Company\u2019s ongoing risk assessment process. The Company may be subject to other climate risks not included below. \u00a0 Climate Risk Description Physical Windstorms Increased frequency and intensity of windstorms, such as hurricanes, could lead to property damage, loss of property value and interruptions to business operations Sea Level Rise Rising sea levels could lead to storm surge and other potential impacts for low-lying coastal properties leading to damage, loss of property value and interruptions to business operations Flooding Change in rainfall conditions leading to increased frequency and severity of flooding could lead to property damage, loss of property value and interruptions to business operations Wildfires Change in fire potential could lead to permanent loss of property, stress on human health (air quality) and stress on ecosystem services Heat and Water Stress Increases in temperature could lead to droughts and decreased available water supply could lead to higher utility usage, supply interruptions and reputational issues in local communities Transition Regulation Regulations at the federal, state and local levels could impose additional operating and capital costs associated with utilities, energy efficiency, building materials and building design Reputation Increased interest among retail tenants in building efficiency, sustainable design criteria and \"green leases\", which incorporate provisions intended to promote sustainability at the property, could result in decreased demand for outdated space \u00a0 The Company\u2019s approach in mitigating these risks include but are not limited to (i) carrying additional insurance coverage relating to flooding and windstorms, (ii) maintaining a geographically diversified portfolio, which limits exposure to event driven risks and (iii) creating a form \u201cgreen lease\u201d for its tenants which incorporates varied criteria that align landlord and tenant sustainability priorities as well as establishing green construction criteria. \u00a0 In 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million in 2.70% notes due 2030 in its inaugural green bond offering. The net proceeds from this offering are allocated to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, recently completed, existing or future eligible green projects, with projects are to be aligned\u00a0with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles, 2018 as administered by the International Capital Market Association. Additionally, the Company\u2019s $2.0 billion Credit Facility (as defined below) is a green credit facility which incorporates rate adjustments associated with attainment (or nonattainment) of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions reductions. \u00a0 Information About Our Executive Officers \u00a0 The following table sets forth information with respect to the executive officers of the Company as of December 31, 2022: \u00a0 Name Age Position Joined Kimco Milton Cooper 93 Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors Co-Founder Conor C.
