{"cik": 1501585, "item_1A": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS   History and Organization  Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (\"HII\", the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") is a global, all-domain defense partner, building and delivering the world's most powerful, survivable naval ships and technologies that safeguard America\u2019s seas, sky, land, space, and cyber. For more than a century, our Ingalls Shipbuilding segment (\"Ingalls\") in Mississippi and Newport News Shipbuilding segment (\"Newport News\") in Virginia have built more ships in more ship classes than any other U.S. naval shipbuilder, making us America's largest shipbuilder. Our Mission Technologies (formerly named Technical Solutions) segment delivers high-value engineering and technology solutions to enable multi-domain distributed operations in the government and commercial markets. Headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, we employ approximately 43,000 people domestically and internationally.  We conduct most of our business with the U.S. Government, primarily the Department of Defense (\"DoD\"). As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or partner, we participate in many high-priority U.S. defense programs. Ingalls includes our non-nuclear ship design, construction, repair, and maintenance businesses. Newport News includes all of our nuclear ship design, construction, overhaul, refueling, and repair and maintenance businesses. Our Mission Technologies segment provides a wide range of services and products, including command, control, computers, communications, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (\"C5ISR\") systems and operations; the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to battlefield decisions; defensive and offensive cyberspace strategies and electronic warfare (\"CEWS\"); unmanned autonomous systems; live, virtual, and constructive training solutions (\"LVC\"); platform modernization; and critical nuclear operations.   Ingalls \u00a0 Through our Ingalls segment, we design and construct non-nuclear ships for the U.S.\u00a0Navy and U.S.\u00a0Coast Guard, including amphibious assault ships, expeditionary warfare ships, surface combatants, and national security cutters (\"NSC\").  We are the sole builder of amphibious assault ships and one of two builders of surface combatants for the U.S. Navy. We are the sole builder of large multi-mission NSCs for the U.S.\u00a0Coast Guard. Our Ingalls segment is located in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 800 acres along the Pascagoula River.  Amphibious Assault Ships   We construct amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S. Navy, which include U.S. Navy large deck amphibious assault ships (\"LHA\") and amphibious transport dock ships (\"LPD\"), respectively. The LHA is a key component of the Department of the Navy's requirement for Expeditionary Strike Groups/Amphibious Readiness Groups, and design, construction, and modernization of LHAs are core to our Ingalls operations. In 2007, we were awarded the construction contract for USS America (LHA 6), the first in a class of enhanced amphibious assault ships designed from the keel up to be an aviation optimized Marine assault platform. We delivered USS Tripoli (LHA 7) in 2020 and are currently constructing Bougainville (LHA 8). In 2022, we were awarded the construction contract for Fallujah (LHA 9).   The LPD program is a long-running production program of expeditionary warfare ships in which we have generated efficiencies through ship-over-ship learning. We delivered USS Fort Lauderdale (LPD 28) in 2022, and we are currently constructing Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29), Harrisburg (LPD 30), and Pittsburgh (LPD 31). In 2022, we were awarded a long-lead time material contract for LPD 32 (unnamed).   Surface Combatants   We are a design agent for, and one of only two companies that constructs, Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) guided missile destroyers, a class of surface combatant. We have delivered 34 Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers to the U.S. Navy, including Lenah H. Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG 123) in 2022, USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. (DDG 121) in 2021, and USS Delbert D. Black (DDG 119) in 2020. In 2013, we were awarded a multi-year contract totaling $3.3 billion for construction of five Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers, of which four have been delivered and Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125) is being constructed. In 2018, we were awarded a multi-year contract totaling $5.1 billion for construction of six additional Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers. In 2020, we were awarded a contract to  1 1 1        construct an additional Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyer. We are currently constructing Ted Stevens (DDG128), Jeremiah Denton (DDG 129), George M. Neal (DDG 131), and Sam Nunn (DDG 133).    National Security Cutters   The U.S. Coast Guard's recapitalization program is replacing aging and operationally expansive ships and aircraft used to conduct missions in excess of 50 miles from the shoreline. The flagship of this program is the Legend class NSC, a multi-mission platform we designed and continue to build. We delivered USCGC Stone (NSC 9) to the U.S. Coast Guard in 2020. In 2018, we were awarded long-lead-time material and construction contracts for Calhoun (NSC 10) and Friedman (NSC 11), which are currently under construction.   Newport News  The core business of our Newport News segment is designing and constructing nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines, and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Our Newport News shipyard is located on approximately 550\u00a0acres near the mouth of the James River, which adjoins the Chesapeake Bay.  \u00a0 Design, Construction, Refueling and Complex Overhaul, and Inactivation of Aircraft Carriers  Engineering, design, and construction of U.S.\u00a0Navy nuclear aircraft carriers (\"CVN\") are core to Newport News operations. Aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the U.S.\u00a0Navy's fleet, with a displacement of over 90,000 tons. Newport News has designed and built more than 31 aircraft carriers for the U.S.\u00a0Navy since 1933, including all ten Nimitz class (CVN 68) aircraft carriers currently in active service, as well as the first ship of the next generation Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers. \u00a0 We delivered USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), the first aircraft carrier of the Gerald R. Ford class to the U.S. Navy in 2017. Beginning in 2009, we received contract awards totaling $8.2 billion for construction preparation, detail design, and construction of the second Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carrier, John F. Kennedy (CVN 79). In addition, we have received awards valued at $15.3 billion for detail design and construction of the Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers Enterprise (CVN 80) and Doris Miller (CVN 81).   We continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul (\"RCOH\"). Each RCOH takes nearly four years to complete, with the work accounting for approximately 35% of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carrier's 50 year service life. RCOH services include propulsion work (refueling of reactors; propulsion plant modernization; and propulsion plant repairs), restoration of service life (dry docking, tank, and void maintenance; hull, shafting, propellers, and rudders; launch and recovery system; piping repairs; and component refurbishment), and modernization (electrical systems; aviation support systems; warfare; interoperability; and environmental compliance). We provide ongoing maintenance services for the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier fleet through both RCOH and fleet support across the globe.   We are currently performing the RCOH of USS George Washington (CVN 73) and USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). We believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our RCOH performance on the first seven Nimitz class (CVN 68) carriers, our highly trained workforce, the capital-intensive nature of RCOH work, and high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component position us well for RCOH contract awards on the remaining Nimitz class (CVN 68) carriers, as well as future RCOH work on Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers.  We received a contract in 2013 to inactivate the decommissioned Enterprise (CVN 65), the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which was built by us and commissioned in 1961. The decommissioned Enterprise (CVN 65) inactivation was completed in the second quarter of 2018. Aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years, and we believe the ten Nimitz class (CVN 68) carriers we delivered that are currently in active service, as well as Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers, present significant opportunities for inactivation contracts as they reach the end of their lifespans. We believe we are well positioned as the U.S. Navy's shipyard of choice for these contract awards.  2 2 2        Design and Construction of Nuclear-Powered Submarines   We are one of only two companies in the United States capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. Newport News has delivered 63 submarines to the U.S. Navy since 1960, comprised of 49 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Of the 50 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 25 were delivered by Newport News. Our nuclear submarine program, located at our Newport News shipyard, includes construction, engineering, design, research, and integrated planning.   Virginia Class (SSN 774) Submarines  We have a teaming agreement with Electric Boat Corporation (\"Electric Boat\"), a division of General Dynamics Corporation (\"General Dynamics\"), to build Virginia class (SSN 774) fast attack nuclear submarines. Under the teaming arrangement, we build the stern, habitability and machinery spaces, torpedo room, sail, and bow, while Electric Boat builds the engine room, control room, and pressure hull structure. Work on the reactor plant and the final assembly, test, outfit, and delivery of the submarines to the U.S. Navy alternates between Electric Boat and us.   The four submarines of the first block, six submarines of the second block, and eight submarines of the third block of Virginia class (SSN 774) submarines have been delivered. In 2014, the team was awarded a construction contract for the fourth block of ten Virginia class (SSN 774) submarines, which requires production of two submarines per year. The first submarine of the Block IV contract was delivered in 2020, two more submarines of the Block IV contract were delivered in 2022, and the remaining boats are in the manufacturing and outfitting phases of construction.   In 2019, the team was awarded a construction contract for the fifth block of nine Virginia class (SSN 774) submarines, and, in 2021, an option for a 10th submarine was exercised, continuing the two submarines per year production rate. Eight of the Block V boats are in manufacturing and outfitting stages and two of the Block V boats are in the advance procurement phases.  Columbia Class (SSBN 826) Submarines  Newport News is participating in the design and construction of the Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarines as a replacement for the current aging Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines (\"SSBN\"), which were first introduced into service in 1981. The Columbia class (SSBN 826) program currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines. We perform design work as a subcontractor to Electric Boat, and we have entered into a teaming agreement with Electric Boat to build modules for the entire Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarine program that leverages our Virginia class (SSN 774) experience. We were previously awarded contracts from Electric Boat to begin integrated product and process development and provide long-lead-time material and advance construction for the Columbia class (SSBN 826) program. Contract award for the first two Columbia class submarines (SSBN 826 and SSBN 827) and construction start of the first Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarine occurred in late 2020.  Naval Nuclear Support Services  Newport News provides additional services to and in support of the U.S. Navy, ranging from services supporting the Navy's carrier and submarine fleets to maintenance services at U.S. Navy training facilities. Fleet support services include design, construction, maintenance, and disposal activities for in-service U.S. Navy nuclear ships worldwide through mobile and in-house capabilities. We also provide maintenance services on nuclear reactor prototypes, such as those at the Kenneth A. Kesselring Site, a research and development facility in New York that supports the U.S. Navy.    Mission Technologies   The Mission Technologies segment includes business groups focused on high-end information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) and mission based solutions for DoD, intelligence, and federal civilian customers; life-cycle sustainment services to the U.S. Navy fleet and other maritime customers; unmanned, autonomous systems; and nuclear management and operations and environmental management services for the Department of Energy (\"DoE\"), DoD, state and local governments, and private sector companies. The Mission Technologies segment is comprised of four business groups as follows:  3 3 3        Mission Based Solutions  Our mission based solutions businesses are focused on solving national security challenges for the DoD, the intelligence community, and federal civilian agencies around the globe. The group\u2019s expertise includes intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; cyber operations; secure enterprise information technology engineering and operations; advanced modeling, simulation, and training; and logistics management. Our C5ISR solutions deliver actionable intelligence across the globe at hyper speed through mission systems and operations, accelerating decision-making and exploiting foreign threat vulnerabilities. Our CEWS solutions provide full spectrum cyber, electronic warfare, and space capabilities that address today\u2019s rapidly changing, multi-domain global security threats, and anticipated emerging threats. Our LVC solutions designs and executes enterprise simulation and network technologies to prepare warfighters for virtually every conceivable environment they may face in the service to national defense and security.   Unmanned Systems  Our unmanned systems products and services create advanced unmanned maritime solutions for defense, marine research, and commercial applications. Serving customers in more than 30 countries, our unmanned systems group provides design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations, and sustainment of unmanned systems, including unmanned underwater vehicles and unmanned surface vessels.  Fleet Sustainment  Our fleet support services provide comprehensive life-cycle sustainment services to the U.S. Navy fleet and other DoD and commercial maritime customers. We provide services including maintenance, modernization, and repair on all ship classes; naval architecture, marine engineering, and design; integrated logistics support; technical documentation development; warehousing, asset management, and material readiness; operational and maintenance training development and delivery; software design and development; IT infrastructure support and data delivery and management; and cyber security and information assurance. We provide undersea vehicle and specialized craft development and prototyping services.  Nuclear and Environmental Services  Our nuclear and environmental services focus on nuclear management and operations. We provide site management, nuclear and industrial facilities operations and maintenance, decontamination and decommissioning, and radiological and hazardous waste management services to DoE, DoD, state and local governments, and private sector companies. As part of our nuclear and environmental services, we participate in joint ventures, including Newport News Nuclear BWXT Los Alamos, LLC (\"N3B\"), Mission Support and Test Services, LLC (\"MSTS\"), and Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (\"SRNS\"). We have a 51% ownership interest in N3B, which, in 2017, was awarded the Los Alamos Legacy Cleanup Contract at the DoE/National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory located northwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico. We have a 23% ownership interest in MSTS, which, in 2017, was awarded a contract for site management and operations at the Nevada National Security Site located northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. We have a 34% ownership interest in SRNS, which provides site management and operations at the DoE's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.   Customers  Our revenues are primarily derived from the U.S. Government, including the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, the DoD, the DoE, and other federal agencies. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, approximately 82%, 90%, and 88%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from the U.S. Navy.   Intellectual Property  We develop new technologies that are incorporated into the products we produce and services we provide for our customers. We also develop new manufacturing processes and systems-integration technologies and processes that we use to produce our products and to provide services to our customers. In addition to owning intellectual property, we license intellectual property rights to and from other parties. The U.S. Government generally receives non-exclusive licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of U.S. Government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our U.S. Government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense.\u00a0The U.S. Government may use or authorize other parties to use the  4 4 4        intellectual property we license to the government. While our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business.   Seasonality  No material portion of our business is seasonal. The timing of our revenue recognition is based on multiple factors, including the timing of contract awards, the incurrence of contract costs, contract cost estimation, and unit deliveries. See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item\u00a08.   Backlog  As of December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, our total backlog was approximately $47.1 billion and $48.5 billion, respectively. We expect approximately 22% of backlog at December\u00a031, 2022, to be converted into sales in 2023.     Raw Materials   The most significant material we use is steel. Other materials we use in large quantities include paint, aluminum, pipe, electrical cable, and fittings. All of these materials are currently available in adequate supply. In connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. For long-term contracts, we generally solicit price quotations for many of our material requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing. While we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source, we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts as a result of consolidation in the defense industry. We believe these single source suppliers, as well as our overall supplier base, are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs. Any inability to procure the necessary raw materials, components, and other supplies for our products on a timely basis could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flow. In addition, a significant prolonged increase in inflation could negatively impact the cost of raw materials, components, and other supplies. We mitigate some supply risk by negotiating long-term agreements with certain raw material suppliers, and we mitigate inflation risk related to raw material to an extent through price escalation provisions in certain customer contracts.    Regulatory Matters  We operate in heavily regulated markets and must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S.\u00a0Government contracts, as well as legal and regulatory requirements relating to cyber security, environmental protection, and our nuclear operations. Government contracting requirements increase our contract performance costs and compliance costs and risks.\u00a0See Risk Factors in Item 1A.  Government Contracting  We are overseen and audited by the U.S.\u00a0Government and its agencies, including the U.S.\u00a0Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\"), and the Defense Contract Management Agency (\"DCMA\"). These agencies evaluate our contract performance, cost structures, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings, which could result in fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory, treble, or other damages. Certain U.S. Government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export privileges.  U.S. Government agencies also evaluate the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to U.S. Government requirements. Our business systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems, purchasing systems, government property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management accounting systems. The U.S.\u00a0Government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems.  The U.S.\u00a0Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, with little or no prior notice, for convenience or for default based upon performance. In the event of termination of a contract for convenience, a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on incurred costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the profit that would have been earned had the contract been  5 5 5        completed. Such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program. A termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities, including excess re-procurement costs, and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts.   Our contracts with the U.S. Government sometimes result in Requests for Equitable Adjustments (\"REAs\"), which represent requests for the U.S. Government to make appropriate adjustments to contract terms, including pricing, delivery schedule, technical requirements, or other affected terms, due to changes to the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption for which the U.S. Government is responsible. We submit and negotiate REAs in the ordinary course of business, and large REAs are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and RCOH activities. REAs can result in claims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, in cases in which we cannot reach agreement with the U.S. Government.   U.S. Government regulations determine contractor costs that are allowable and therefore recoverable from the government, and certain costs are not allowable and therefore not recoverable. The U.S. Government also regulates the methods by which allowable costs, including overhead, are allocated to government contracts. Costs we incur that are not allowable under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (the \u201cFAR\u201d) or U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (\u201cCAS\u201d) or that are otherwise determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract are not recovered or must be refunded if already reimbursed.   Our business, including contracts with U.S. Government agencies and subcontracts with other prime contractors, is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including the FAR, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (\"DFARS\"), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act, CAS, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in contract values, contract modifications or terminations, penalties, fines, repayments, compensatory, treble, or other damages, or suspension or debarment. We are also subject to evolving cyber security and data privacy and protection laws and regulations, which increase our costs and compliance risks and may affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to damage claims, substantial fines, and other penalties. See Note 7: Revenue under Item 8 and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further information regarding our contracts.  Nuclear  Our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, the DoE, and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the event of noncompliance, these agencies may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, or shut down our operations, depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance. In addition, new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, the DoE, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures.  Subject to certain requirements and limitations, our contracts with the U.S. Navy and the DoE generally provide for indemnity by the U.S. Government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations. For our commercial nuclear operations, we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation, and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further information regarding nuclear regulatory matters.  Environmental  Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Substantial fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance, and certain environmental laws impose joint and several \"strict liability\" for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties.  We accrue estimated costs to perform environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future, in amounts we can reasonably estimate, to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities, or at sites where we are named a Potentially Responsible Party (\"PRP\") by the U.S.\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") or similarly designated by another environmental agency. Uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation, determination of legally responsible parties, and  6 6 6        the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations make future environmental remediation costs difficult to estimate and can cause our estimated remediation costs to change.  We believe we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business. We could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations, including any laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment, or natural resources. We have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental legal requirements, but we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations. We do not currently believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A and Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies under Item 8 for further information regarding environmental matters.   Competitive Environment  In our business of designing, building, overhauling, and repairing military ships, we primarily compete with General Dynamics and, in the case of certain non-nuclear shipbuilding programs, smaller shipyards. The smaller shipyards sometimes team with large defense contractors. Intense competition related to programs, resources, funding, and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our shipbuilding business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general. It is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another party, become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party. It is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, serve as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding long-term contracts, enable companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries.  We believe we are well-positioned in our shipbuilding markets. Because we are the only company currently capable of building, refueling, and inactivating the U.S.\u00a0Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, we believe we are positioned well to be awarded future contracts to perform such activities. Even so, the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities. If a U.S. Government shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our market position could be significantly and adversely affected.  While we have competed with another large defense contractor to build large deck amphibious ships, we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S.\u00a0Navy, including LHAs and LPDs. We are also the sole builder of NSCs for the U.S. Coast Guard. We are one of only two companies currently capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy, and we are party to long-term teaming agreements with the other company for the production of both Virginia class (SSN 774) fast attack nuclear submarines and Columbia class (SSBN 826) ballistic missile submarines. We are one of only two companies that builds the U.S. Navy's current fleet of Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers and are positioned well to be awarded future contracts for surface combatant ships as well.   Our Mission Technologies segment delivers technology based products and solutions to government and commercial markets. Key competitive factors in these markets include technology capabilities, innovative cyber advances and artificial intelligence, the ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; the ability to meet delivery schedules; and cost effectiveness. Our success depends on investments in our people, technologies, and products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. To remain competitive, we must be able to identify emerging technology trends and consistently provide superior service, while understanding customer priorities and maintaining customer relationships.  Our Mission Technologies segment competes domestically and internationally against large aerospace and defense (\"A&D\") companies, primarily L3 Harris, Amentum, ManTech, Leidos, and, increasingly, small businesses serving the intelligence community. To a lesser extent, our lines of business compete on certain contracts with major prime A&D contractors, including Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and Boeing.  Our success depends upon our ability to develop, market, produce, and deliver our products and services at costs consistent with our customers' expectations, as well as our ability to provide the workforce, technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency.  7 7 7         Human Capital Resources  We recognize that our employees are our most important resources and serve as the foundation for our ability to achieve financial and strategic objectives. Our employees are critical to driving operational execution, meeting customer expectations, delivering strong financial performance, advancing innovation, and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program. Our leaders believe each employee contributes to our success.   We have approximately 43,000 employees. We are the largest industrial employer in Virginia and the largest private employer in Mississippi. We employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades, with approximately 7,100 engineers and designers and approximately 3,600 employees with advanced degrees. Our workforce contains many third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation employees, and approximately 1,600 employees with more than 40 years of continuous service. Employees in our shipbuilding segments with more than 40 years of continuous service achieve the honor of \u201cMaster Shipbuilder.\u201d As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had 1,305 Master Shipbuilders at Newport News and 242 at Ingalls. We also employ more than 7,400 veterans across the enterprise.  In addition, over 1,000 apprentices are enrolled in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs at our two shipbuilding segments. From nuclear pipe welders to senior executives, we employ approximately 4,600 apprentice school alumni at Newport News and Ingalls.  Approximately 45% of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements and one site stabilization agreement. Newport News has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, which expire in April 2024, February 2027, and December 2027. Newport News craft workers employed at the Kesselring Site near Saratoga Springs, New York are represented under an indefinite DoE site agreement. Ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, all of which expire in March 2026. Approximately 15 Mission Technologies employees in Klamath Falls, Oregon are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in June 2025.   We have not experienced a work stoppage in more than 23 years at Newport News and more than 15 years at Ingalls. We are committed to working effectively with our existing unions and believe our relationship with our represented employees is satisfactory.   The success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and develop a skilled and diverse workforce of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. To succeed in the markets in which we compete for labor, we have developed key workforce development, recruitment, and retention strategies and objectives that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies and objectives form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies, and initiatives:  Competitive Pay and Benefits - Our compensation programs are designed to ensure we have the ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees to achieve our objectives. \u2022We provide employee base wages and salaries that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location. \u2022We utilize nationally recognized surveys and outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our employee and executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry.   \u2022The structure of our executive compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance, and we align our executive long-term equity compensation metrics with long-term shareholder interests. \u2022Employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, 401(k) plans, and life and disability/accident insurance coverage. We also offer a variety of benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including: annual leave/paid time off; paid holidays, flexible work arrangements/schedules; telemedicine; parental leave; transgender medical coverage; and a wellness program that includes physical, mental, and financial wellness components. We also fund the operation of Family Health Centers near our two shipyards, which provide a full range of medical, lab, pharmacy, dental, physical therapy, and vision services.  Recruitment, Training, and Workforce Development - Our three segments hire thousands of employees each year. In 2022, we hired over 7,500 new employees. To help us meet this large demand for talent, we have created, developed, and maintain multiple talent pipelines. One of the key components of our approach to workforce  8 8 8        development is to \u201cgrow our own.\u201d We operate two apprentice schools, one at Ingalls and one at Newport News. The Newport News Apprentice School was founded in 1919, and the Ingalls Apprentice School was founded in 1952.    The two apprentice schools combined have graduated over 14,250 graduates since their inceptions. The schools are nationally renowned and are critical to training both our craft/trades and technical workforce, as well as developing the future leaders of our company. The Ingalls Apprentice School has partnered with the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College to permit their apprentices to earn credits toward an associate\u2019s degree. The Newport News Apprentice School has partnered with two community colleges, as well as Old Dominion University, to enable apprentices to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Modeling & Simulation.   In addition to operating our own apprentice schools, we have developed and nurtured multiple partnerships with state and local governments, pre-K education providers, primary/secondary school districts, community colleges, and four-year colleges and universities, as well as post-graduate institutions. We also make significant investments through monetary contributions, leadership time, and employee volunteer hours to support these critical partnerships.    We maintain effective partnerships with colleges and universities, military bases for transitioning veterans, and regional community colleges to enable us to recruit and hire engineering, IT, and other technical talent. Working closely with state and local government leaders, we have successfully facilitated local, regional, and state-wide workforce development and education initiatives that include pre-K programs, high school trades programs/talent development labs, pre-hire trades/technical community college programs, interns/co-ops with colleges and universities, adult trades programs, veterans and military spouses training programs, and unemployed/underemployed training programs.  We view our workforce development process critical to our success and have developed a robust and effective succession planning process that ensures continuity in our leadership ranks. Since our founding in 2011, we have followed our succession plans 81% of the time when replacing a vacancy in an existing vice president position, and we have filled 82% of newly created vice president positions with internal hires. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further information regarding our human capital resources.  Environmental, Health & Safety (\u201cEH&S\u201d) - The health, safety, and well-being of our employees, together with protection of the environment in the communities in which we operate, is one of our core values and rooted in our culture across the enterprise. We prioritize, manage, and carefully track safety performance and integrate sound environmental, safety, and health practices to make a meaningful difference in every facet of our operations, particularly at our shipbuilding segments and at DoE sites on which Mission Technologies segment employees work.    Safety goals are included in operational metrics under the Newport News and Ingalls compensation programs. We also use a wide variety of training courses, pre-job \u201cTake Five\u201d crew talks, medical surveillance programs, and employee involvement to focus our workforce on EH&S. At Newport News and Ingalls, a key component of our EH&S program is the utilization of health and safety teams, which are comprised of production and maintenance employees and front-line managers whose goal is to educate, engage, and empower our workforce toward a culture that strives to reduce injury, illness, and environmental impacts. We employ programs focused on identifying, reporting, and abating near misses and other programs that aim to recognize, evaluate, and control hazards.  We track multiple metrics related to occupational injuries as one of several methods to monitor our safety performance. One of the key metrics is Total Case Rate (\u201cTCR\u201d), which is the number of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") recordable injuries per 100 equivalent employees. The TCR for Newport News was 5.58 in 2022, 5.64 in 2021, and 4.77 in 2020, and the TCR at Ingalls was 5.67 in 2022, 6.26 in 2021, and 6.35 in 2020. Newport News also tracks Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (\u201cDART\u201d), which is the number of OSHA recordable cases in which the employee is unable to work, cannot work due to a restriction, or can work with a restriction as a result of an injury per 100 equivalent employees. DART at Newport News was 4.86 in 2022, 4.45 in 2021, and 3.41 in 2020. Ingalls tracks two other safety metrics: Lost Time Case Rate (\u201cLTCR\u201d), which is the number of employees that lost work time per 100 employees, and Lost Work Day Rate (\u201cLWDR\u201d), which is the number of lost workdays per 100 full-time employees. The LTCR and LWDR at Ingalls were 2.55 and 73.06, respectively, in 2022, 2.75 and 76.32, respectively, in 2021, and 2.53 and 56.37, respectively, in 2020.  9 9 9        Corporate Values - We operate on a set of values that are shared with all employees: Integrity, Safety, Respect, Engagement, Responsibility, and Performance. \"Always doing the right thing\" is an essential belief at HII, and the tone starts at the top and permeates through the culture of the company. It is a set of core values, standards, and behaviors that guide employee commitment to the highest ethical standards and serves as the underlying framework for all of our human capital strategies.  Advancing and Celebrating Diversity and Inclusion (\u201cD&I\u201d) - We believe we gain a key competitive advantage by building a workforce community that values contributions and perspectives from a variety of backgrounds, skills, and experiences regardless of race, ethnicity, color, religion, sex, disability, nationality, or other differentiation, and our leaders leverage the differences within their teams. We also believe D&I is vital to our ability to grow and innovate in an ever-changing, fast-paced environment. Our diverse and inclusive workplace encourages different perspectives and ideas, which we believe enables better business decisions. The following are highlights of our D&I program: \u2022Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) are a key component of our corporate culture and an important part of our diversity and inclusion strategy. We currently sponsor 20 ERGs, which represent 10 distinct affinity groups, are employee-led and open to all employees, and include: African American Shipbuilders Association, Asian & Pacific Islander Shipbuilding Association, Hispanic Outreach & Leadership Alliance, Women in Shipbuilding Enterprise, Ingalls Shipbuilders Equality Alliance, Shipbuilders Together Realizing Inclusion, Diversity and Equality, Engaging Employees to Learn Improve Network and Knowledge Share, FitNNS, and the Veterans Employee Resource Groups. \u2022We have established D&I Councils, which provide strategic direction, guidance, and advocacy for our D&I initiatives and advancements. These councils are led by senior executives and include high-performing employees and leaders from across our enterprise. \u2022We have a long history of participation in a number of annual national diversity conferences, including Black Engineer of the Year Awards (BEYA), Society of Hispanic Engineers and Professionals (SHPE), Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE), and Women of Color STEM Conference. These events provide recruitment, recognition, and development opportunities for our diverse workforce.  Employee Engagement - Since 2006, we have conducted an annual anonymous engagement survey of our workforce, both non-represented and represented. Administered and analyzed by an independent third party, the survey results are reviewed by our executive team and other senior leaders at our three segments. The results of this engagement survey are also shared with individual managers and employees, who are then tasked with discussing the results with their teams and working together to set goals and implement actions to improve employee engagement and performance. Approximately 78% of our workforce participated in the 2022 engagement survey. We believe that, at the individual employee level, engagement is about taking ownership of your work and work processes. At the enterprise level, engagement is about creating an inclusive and highly collaborative culture where we all care about and encourage each other\u2019s success, and supporting the opportunity to create more value and transform our business for the future.
