{"cik": 52988, "item_1A": "Item 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS Creating a More Connected, Sustainable World At Jacobs, we\u2019re challenging today to reinvent tomorrow by solving the world\u2019s most critical problems for thriving cities, resilient environments, mission-critical outcomes, operational advancement, scientific discovery and cutting-edge manufacturing, turning abstract ideas into realities that transform the world for good. Leveraging a talent force of approximately 60,000, Jacobs provides a full spectrum of professional services including consulting, technical, engineering, scientific and project delivery for the government and private sector. Over the last seven years, Jacobs has been on a transformation journey, starting with a re-emphasis on business excellence, our culture and brand, and evolving our portfolio to create an inclusive, technology-forward company producing the critical solutions of tomorrow. This transformation included acquiring a 65% stake in PA Consulting Group Limited (\"PA Consulting\") in fiscal 2021. Acquisitions of Buffalo Group, BlackLynx and StreetLight further positioned us as a leader in high-value government services and technology-enabled solutions. Our brand promise: \"Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow.\" signals our transition to a global technology-forward solutions company. We began trading as \u201cJ\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2019, and in March 2021 our Global Industry Classifications Standard code changed to Research & Consulting Services. Our Focus 2023 Transformation Office drove further innovation, delivering value-creating solutions for our clients and leveraging an integrated digital and technology strategy to improve our efficiency and effectiveness, ultimately freeing up valuable time and resources for reinvestment in our people.  Boldly Moving Forward In March 2022, Jacobs launched a three-year strategy that builds on our success over the preceding three years and takes advantage of a new lens crafted from the incredible pace of change in the world and in our markets. We\u2019re now focused on broadening our leadership in high growth sectors aligned with long-term secular trends, such as infrastructure renewal and investment, and the global transition to more sustainable ways of living. Our strategy is driven by our purpose and values and reflects our vision of becoming a company like no other. An extensive evaluation of global trends, capabilities and markets to understand the largest opportunities, projected spend and growth rates identified three growth accelerators: Climate Response, Consulting & Advisory and Data Solutions, which cut across our entire organization and markets creating connections among global market trends, the solutions we deliver and our company purpose. Our three growth accelerators are delivering significant value for our clients, positioning Jacobs for high-margin growth while advancing sustainability and social value in the communities where we serve.   We know we have a pivotal role to play across the entire Climate Response value chain \u2013 focusing on end-to-end solutions in energy transition, decarbonization, adaptation and resilience, and regenerative and nature-based climate solutions. Today our clients are facing a rapidly changing world - navigating multifaceted challenges such as the increasing pace of technological change, budget and supply chain limitations, global climate change events and complex geopolitical conditions. Through our Consulting & Advisory capabilities, we deepen our involvement with our clients to help them conceptualize, shape and realize their future. We also harness our Data Solutions, providing data and digital capabilities,  Page 4 Page 4 Page 4   products and tools to help our clients operate more efficiently in a safe environment and capitalize on their data more than ever before. We're empowering innovation and ingenuity to unlock better outcomes.   We believe our deep global knowledge in our core sectors, applied together with the latest advances in technology, are why customers large and small choose to partner with Jacobs. In fiscal 2022, we operated in two lines of business (LOBs): Critical Mission Solutions and People & Places Solutions, and a third business segment as a result of our majority investment in PA Consulting. As part of our strategy, starting in fiscal 2023 Jacobs formed a new enabling platform, Divergent Solutions (DVS), which serves as the core foundation for developing and delivering innovative, next-generation cloud, cyber, data and digital technologies - further strengthening our ability to drive value for our clients.  Jacobs holds leading positions across our sectors in the Engineering News Record (ENR)'s rankings for Advanced Manufacturing, Cities & Places, Energy & Environment, Health & Life Sciences and Infrastructure. In fiscal 2023, we ranked \u2116 1 on ENR's list of Top 500 design firms for the sixth consecutive year, \u2116 1 on ENR's Top 50 Program Management Firms for the third consecutive year, and \u2116 1 on ENR's Top 20 Firms in Combined Design and CM-PM Professional Services Revenue. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (the predecessor parent company) created a new holding company, Jacobs Solutions Inc., which became the new parent of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Jacobs Solutions Inc. is now more closely aligning our public identity with a global technology-forward solutions company. As a result of the transaction, the predecessor company\u2019s then-current stockholders automatically became stockholders of Jacobs Solutions Inc., on a one-for-one basis, with the same number of shares and same ownership percentage of the Company\u2019s common stock that they held in the predecessor company immediately prior to the transaction.  Page 5 Page 5 Page 5   Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow  Our values continue to guide our behaviors, relationships and outcomes \u2014 allowing us to act as one company and unify us worldwide when interacting with our clients, employees, communities and shareholders.  \u2022We do things right. We always act with integrity \u2014 taking responsibility for our work, caring for our people and staying focused on safety and sustainability. We make investments in our clients, people and communities, so we can grow together. \u2022We challenge the accepted. We know that to create a better future, we must ask difficult questions. We always stay curious and are not afraid to try new things. \u2022We aim higher. We do not settle \u2014 always looking beyond to raise the bar and deliver with excellence. We are committed to our clients by bringing innovative solutions that lead to profitable growth and shared success. \u2022We live inclusion. We put people at the heart of our business. We embrace different perspectives, collaborating to make a positive impact. Through a strong focus on inclusion, with a diverse team of visionaries, thinkers and doers, we build trust \u2014 in each other and across our company.  Page 6 Page 6 Page 6    We do things right Jacobs' ethics and Code of Conduct are rooted in our values and provide the standards and support to help us successfully navigate issues, make the right decisions and conduct our business with the integrity that reflects our heritage and ethical reputation. We hold our suppliers and business partners to the same standards.  From the way we operate our business, to the sustainable solutions we co-create with clients and other organizations, we look for ways to make a positive environmental, societal and economic impact for our people, businesses, governments and communities around the world.  Aligned with the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), PlanBeyond\u00ae is our approach to integrating sustainability throughout our operations and client solutions \u2014 planning beyond today for a more sustainable future for everyone. We identified six core SDGs that are material to our business, where we can have the most influence and impact, and we remain committed to contribute toward all 17 of the UN SDGs. We also continue to remain agile as our business evolves. Given the level of interconnectedness, complexity and pace of change in our world and company, we recognize that other SDGs are of elevated importance to Jacobs, too. Notably these include, SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy; SDGs 14 and 15 - Life Below Water and Life on Land, respectively; and SDG 5 - Gender Equality.  Industry Leadership on Climate Response Jacobs identified Climate Response as one of three core growth accelerators within our fiscal 2022 to 2024 Company Strategy \u2013 aligning positive societal impact with long-term business growth.  Our key ambitions focus on driving positive impact through our operations and client solutions - including achieving net zero across the value chain by 2040 and contributing to the UN SDGs across all of our solutions by 2025. Our net-zero targets are approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and our carbon neutrality status is in line with the international standard PAS 2060. Detailed in our Carbon Neutrality Commitment, starting in 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021, we achieved 100% low-carbon electricity, and we also became carbon neutral for our operations and business travel in 2020. We continue to maintain these commitments. Page 7 Page 7 Page 7     In fiscal 2023, Jacobs launched our inaugural Sustainability Linked Bonds (SLBs) further reflecting our industry leadership and commitment to incorporating sustainability into the Company's financing strategy. The SLBs' performance is underpinned by two Key Performance Indicators, one that is directly linked to Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities (UN SDG 5 and UN SDG 10) and the other to Climate Action (UN SDG 13). Our ESG Disclosures Report shares our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance, reported in alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework. We have sustained industry leading ISS Prime Status for our ESG corporate rating \u2013 this is awarded to companies with an ESG performance above the sector-specific Prime threshold, which means that we fulfil ambitious absolute performance requirements. In fiscal 2023, Jacobs was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index 2022, reinforcing our position as a global sustainability leader. The Dow Jones Sustainability World Index tracks the financial performance of leading sustainability-driven companies worldwide. Jacobs is one of only 325 organizations globally to make the list, out of the more than 10,000 publicly traded companies that are invited to participate in the assessment.   We received the World Environment Center\u2019s prestigious 2023 Gold Medal Award recognizing our international corporate achievement in sustainable development. We also earned a place on CDP's \u201cA\u201d List for climate for the first time and received a gold medal in the EcoVadis Sustainability Ratings.   Supporting our Communities  We focus on putting our values into practice. Around the world, our people craft solutions that affect the way people live; helping to improve social, environmental and economic resiliency.   Every year, we invest in local communities not only where our employees live and work, but globally, collaborating with charities and not-for-profit organizations to make a positive impact and live our values. Through Collectively\u2120, our global giving and volunteering program, employees can support eligible charities with Jacobs matching donations to a certain level, request a company donation to a charity of their choice that is aligned with our values and strategic causes, and receive paid volunteer time and rewards.   In fiscal 2023, we donated over $3.2 million to 2,700+ charities across 29 countries. Our people tracked approximately 21,000 volunteer hours and completed nearly 1,700 engagement activities.  Social Value and Equity Advisory  Supporting UN SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, we integrate social value and equity considerations and innovations into the solutions we deliver for our clients. We work with our clients to help them realize social value opportunities through their projects and services by embedding social, economic and environmental benefit generation in what they do. Our blueprint for creating social value through infrastructure investments sets the overarching framework for the solutions we provide to help clients create social value and contribute to a more inclusive economy.   Social value is a fast-evolving field, and its successful delivery requires a wide range of specialisms. Our partner and fully owned subsidiary Simetrica-Jacobs specializes in social value, wellbeing research and impact evaluation, and has contributed to internationally endorsed methods set out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and government-produced guidelines, including the U.K. Government\u2019s HM Treasury Green Book. We help clients understand how they can transform local, city and regional decision-making \u2013 identifying innovative, inclusive and ethical investments that will drive social change, spread prosperity and meet the growing challenges facing communities.    Page 8 Page 8 Page 8    As global challenges to our security, wellbeing and ability to operate evolve, BeyondZero\u00ae continues to drive a safer, more secure, healthier and more resilient future for our Jacobs family. Aligning with UN SDG 3: Good Health & Wellbeing, we stay focused on managing Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) and security risks effectively and leveraging our Culture of Caring\u2120 to deliver the best outcomes for our people, the environment, our clients, our communities and our shareholders. Through our Mental Health Matters program, we empower our workforce, so they know they work in an environment where their mental health and wellbeing is the top priority and where everyone can \"bring their best whole self to work.\"  We challenge the accepted  To us, everything we do \u2013 whether tackling water scarcity, aging infrastructure, access to life-saving therapies or sophisticated cyberattacks \u2013 is more than a job. We work every day to make the world better for all. Supporting UN SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, we foster a culture of technology and innovation to support the advancement of society. For us, innovation means creating and delivering value and Beyond IfSM is our global innovation program instilling and sustaining our innovation culture. It represents our creativity and agility to challenge the accepted, with the domain expertise to push beyond our boundaries and deliver for today and into tomorrow. We act to turn ideas into reality and create outcomes that deliver value for our clients and society at large. We aim higher  We take on some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges, bringing a different way of thinking to everything we do, challenging the status quo and questioning what others might accept. We craft solutions that affect the way people live. From delivering vital infrastructure to help communities adapt and thrive to retrofitting vaccine facilities to protect public health, we solve for better, never losing sight of our responsibility to each other.  BeyondExcellence\u2120 is our global approach to quality, performance excellence, continual improvement and recognizing those who set the new standard in delivering for our clients. With a core set of processes in place, BeyondExcellence gives us a framework to deliver value on our projects through good governance, assurance and improvement. We live inclusion  At Jacobs, we\u2019re building an inclusive and diverse culture to provide a solid foundation for selecting, developing and retaining the best and brightest minds at Jacobs \u2014 a culture we call TogetherBeyond\u2120. We\u2019re taking tangible action to drive meaningful, measurable change both in our company and in the communities we serve. Creating a culture of belonging where everyone can thrive \u2013 where our differences are harnessed to bring the innovative, extraordinary solutions to life that our clients demand from us. We also recognize that our Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) and holistic wellbeing efforts are key components of the \"S\" in ESG \u2014 the social value and equity considerations for our people as well as the communities we serve.   Page 9 Page 9 Page 9   Our eight Jacobs Employee Networks (JENs) promote inclusion and equality, not only within Jacobs but with our clients, potential recruits and within the communities that we serve. The JENs are employee-led and organized, partnering with leadership to shape an inclusive organization and ensure everyone feels that they belong.  Page 10 Page 10 Page 10   We maintain agile and disciplined capital deployment  M&A and Divestitures  Consistent with our profitable growth strategy, Jacobs pursues acquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and other transactions to maximize long-term value by continuing to reshape our portfolio to higher value solutions and accelerating profitable growth strategy. The Company has recently made, or announced its intention to make, the following acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures: \u2022On May 9, 2023, the Company announced our intention to spin-off our Critical Mission Solutions business into an independent publicly traded company to Jacobs\u2019 stockholders. On November 20, 2023, Jacobs entered into a definitive agreement to spin-off and combine our CMS and Cyber and Intelligence government services (part of Divergent Solutions (\"DVS\")) businesses with Amentum, in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction intended to be tax-free to Jacobs\u2019 shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The transaction, which is expected to close in fiscal year 2024, is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  \u2022On February 4, 2022, Jacobs acquired StreetLight Data, Inc. (\"StreetLight\"). StreetLight is a pioneer of mobility analytics who uses its data and machine learning resources to shed light on mobility and enable users to solve complex transportation problems. \u2022On November 19, 2021, Jacobs acquired BlackLynx, Inc. (\"BlackLynx\"), a provider of high-performance software, to complement Jacobs' portfolio of cyber, intelligence and digital solutions.  \u2022On March 2, 2021, Jacobs completed the strategic investment of a 65% interest in PA Consulting, a UK-based leading innovation and transformation consulting firm.  \u2022On November 24, 2020, Jacobs completed the acquisition of Buffalo Group, a leader in advanced cyber and intelligence solutions. Share Repurchases During fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased $265.7 million in shares. Shareholder Dividends During fiscal 2023, the Company paid dividends of $0.23 per share in the first quarter and $0.26 per share in the second, third and fourth quarters.  Page 11 Page 11 Page 11   Operating Segments The services we provided to our markets in fiscal 2023 fall into the following two lines of business (LOB): Critical Mission Solutions (CMS) and People & Places Solutions (P&PS). Our LOBs, our business unit Divergent Solutions (DVS), which operates as an integrated offering to both LOBs, and a majority investment in PA Consulting, constitute the Company\u2019s operating segments.\u00a0 For additional information regarding our segments, including information about our financial results by segment and financial results by geography, see Note 19 - Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Critical Mission Solutions (CMS)  In fiscal 2023, Jacobs\u2019 Critical Mission Solutions line of business provided a full spectrum of solutions for clients to address evolving challenges like digital transformation and modernization, national security and defense, space exploration, digital asset management, the clean energy transition, and nuclear decommissioning and cleanup. Our core capabilities include systems and software development and application integration services and consulting; enterprise level IT operations and mission IT services; engineering, design and construction of specialized technical facilities and systems; testing and mission integration; enterprise operations and maintenance; program management; research, development, test and evaluation services; specialized training and mission operations; environmental remediation; and other highly technical consulting solutions to government agencies as well as commercial clients in the U.S. and international markets.   We leverage our deep experience to support clients in the Aerospace, Automotive, Telecommunications, Intelligence, Defense and Energy sectors to develop lasting solutions in the communities where we live and work.  Our clients include the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the Combatant Commands, the U.S. Intelligence Community, NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE), EDF Nuclear Generation, the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), and the Australian Department of Defence, as well as private sector clients mainly in the aerospace, automotive, motorsports, energy and telecom sectors.  Serving mission-critical sectors The U.S. Government is the world\u2019s largest buyer of technical services, and in fiscal 2023, approximately 70% of CMS\u2019s revenue was earned from serving the DoD, Intelligence Community, DoE and other U.S. Federal Civilian governmental entities.  Trends affecting our government clients include an evolving external threat environment including digital transformation and IT modernization; national security and defense infrastructure modernization; space exploration and domain dominance; intelligent asset management to improve capability and extend the life of aging facilities; research and development of nuclear fission and fusion energy technologies and solutions to accelerate the global clean energy transition; and decommissioning and remediation of legacy nuclear sites, all of which are driving demand for our highly technical solutions.  We are also witnessing an increase in the capabilities of unmanned aircraft and hypersonic weapons, which is impacting both offensive and defensive spending priorities among our clients and is a driver for next generation solutions such as C5ISR (command, control, communications, computer, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) and advanced aeronautical and aerothermal testing, respectively. Additionally, we have seen an increase in space exploration initiatives both from the U.S. government, such as NASA\u2019s Artemis program to return to the moon in 2024, as well as the commercial sector.  Within nuclear energy and as part of our Climate Response, our customers have decades-long initiatives to manage and upgrade existing energy infrastructure, construct new nuclear power plants as well as small and advanced modular reactors, and decommission and remediate end-of-life assets. Our customers also manage critical nuclear facilities supporting national security objectives. Our international clients, which accounted for 22% of fiscal 2023 revenue, have also increased demand for our IT and advanced infrastructure solutions, defense and nuclear energy capabilities. In fiscal 2023, approximately 8% of CMS\u2019s revenue was from U.S. commercial sectors, including telecommunications, which anticipates a large cellular infrastructure build-out from 4G to 5G technology. Like our government services clients, our commercial clients are seeking ways to improve capabilities, reduce maintenance costs and optimize their facilities  Page 12 Page 12 Page 12   with network connected facilities and equipment. They also look to CMS for advanced research and development systems and facilities that enable advanced product development. On May 9, 2023, the Company announced our intention to spin-off our Critical Mission Solutions business into an independent publicly traded company to Jacobs\u2019 stockholders. On November 20, 2023, Jacobs entered into a definitive agreement to spin-off and combine our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber and Intelligence government services businesses (part of Divergent Solutions (\"DVS\")) with Amentum, in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction intended to be tax-free to Jacobs\u2019 shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The transaction, which is expected to close in fiscal year 2024, is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.   People & Places Solutions (P&PS)  In fiscal 2023, Jacobs' People & Places Solutions line of business provided end-to-end solutions for our clients\u2019 most complex challenges related to climate change, energy transition, connected mobility, integrated water management and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. In doing so, we combine deep experience in the following sectors - Advanced Manufacturing, Cities & Places, Energy & Environment, Transportation and Water.  Our core skills revolve around consulting, planning, architecture, design, engineering, infrastructure delivery services including project, program and construction management and long-term operation of facilities. Solutions are delivered as standalone professional service engagements, comprehensive program management partnerships, and selective progressive design-build and construction management at-risk delivery services. Increasingly, we use data science and technology-enabled expertise to deliver positive and enduring outcomes for the clients and communities we serve.  Our clients include national, state and local governments in the U.S., Europe, U.K., Middle East, and Asia Pacific, and multinational and local private sector clients throughout the world.  Serving broad industry sectors that support people and places  Infrastructure modernization; climate change; urbanization and population growth; water, food and energy security; strengthening global supply chains; and digital transformation are driving new challenges and opportunities for our clients. These drivers require holistic, integrated and sustainable solutions that draw on our significant knowledge in the markets we serve. For example, an airport is now a smart city with extensive operational, cybersecurity, sustainability and autonomous mobility requirements. Major projects and programs now require advanced analytics to plan for climate adaptation, just and equitable inclusion, and next-generation mobility services. The future of major utilities (water, power/energy, telecommunications) is highly technology-enabled, using digital twins, predictive analytics and smart metering technology to maximize services in the most carbon and commercially efficient manner while protecting the natural environment and the security of supply.   This increase in technology-enabled solutions is a key factor in our growth strategy - both organic and through our recent acquisitions and strategic investments. Our business model is evolving to include proprietary software and analytics to solve modern challenges. A key example of this is the addition of StreetLight's on-demand analytics which are transforming transportation and infrastructure solutions, enabling smarter, more impactful investments.  The combination of these attributes results in a significant effort to modernize infrastructure around the globe. Key examples include advising transportation agencies in major cities as they decarbonize vehicle fleets, including the electrification of New York City\u2019s bus fleet \u2013 the largest in North America \u2013 and San Francisco. We design and deliver battery and vehicle manufacturing facilities for private clients across North America and Europe. In the Energy & Power space, we are supporting the buildout of enabling infrastructure supporting the development of offshore wind assets, especially in the northeast United States. Our knowledge in the environmental, water and wastewater, solid waste, aviation and infrastructure markets has made us a top-ranked environmental consultant and we have supported clients with PFAS assessment and remediation at thousands of sites. Finally, we have long-standing partnerships with the world\u2019s leading life sciences firms, designing and delivering advanced facilities that manufacture critical life-changing vaccines and therapies.   A strong foundation of innovative solutions, a culture of sustainability and inclusion, a focus on climate response and resilience, and an expansive consulting and advisory mindset are woven into every project we deliver for the benefit of people, places and the planet in the communities we serve.  Page 13 Page 13 Page 13   Divergent Solutions (DVS) Jacobs\u2019 business unit and operating segment, Divergent Solutions, serves as the core foundation for developing and delivering innovative, next-generation cloud, cyber, data and digital technologies. DVS further strengthens our ability to drive value for clients of both LOBs by leveraging a full spectrum of cyber, data analytics, systems and software application integration services across Jacobs. Our core capabilities include global strategic alliances, innovation collaboration, next-generation technologies, software and data as a service, and data and secure solutions, all aligned to the three high-growth verticals of Transportation, Water and National Security. DVS clients include government agencies and commercial clients in the U.S. and international markets. The Reverse Morris Trust transaction announced on November 20, 2023 includes portions of DVS, including the Cyber & Intelligence business. PA Consulting (PA) Jacobs invested in a 65% stake in PA Consulting, the company that is bringing ingenuity to life. PA accelerates new growth ideas from concept, through design and development and to commercial success, and revitalizes organizations, building leadership, culture, systems and processes to make innovation a reality. PA\u2019s team of approximately 4,000 strategists, innovators, designers, consultants, digital experts, scientists, engineers and technologists work across seven sectors: consumer and manufacturing, defense and security, energy and utilities, financial services, government, health and life sciences, and transport to make a positive impact alongside the clients it supports.   PA has a diverse mix of private and public sector clients. Private sector clients include global household names like Unilever and Pret A Manger; and start-ups like PulPac, which is converting plant fibers into sustainable packaging, and Hydrow, with its award-winning indoor rowing machine. Public sector clients include national and local government entities like the U.K.\u2019s Ministry of Defence and National Health Service, the Swedish Payments Authority (Utbetalningsmyndigheten), and the U.K.\u2019s Hampshire County Council.  In a fast-moving, complex world, we\u2019re deploying the collective strengths of Jacobs and PA to create significant opportunities for our clients to adapt, innovate and transform. Alongside Copenhagen Metro \u2013 one of the most advanced public transport systems in Europe \u2013 we\u2019re providing strategic management and technical services to support its operations and maintenance. We\u2019ve also been selected by the U.K. Department for Transport to provide technical and commercial advice on its portfolio of rail and other transport mode agreements, major projects and programs, and its policy and strategic work in transport. Significant Customers The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government for each of the last three fiscal years: 20232022\u00a0202131%31%\u00a033% Given the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the U.S. federal government, the loss of U.S. federal government agencies as customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. Approximately 64% of revenue derived directly from the U.S. federal government is in the CMS segment.\u00a0For more information on risks relating to our government contracts, see Item\u00a01A - Risk Factors. Contracts While there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake, our contracts generally fall into two broad categories: cost-reimbursable and fixed-price. The following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last three fiscal years: Page 14 Page 14 Page 14   20232022\u00a02021Cost-reimbursable74%74%76%Fixed-price, limited risk21%21%18%Fixed-price, at risk5%5%6% In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts (including those with the U.S. federal government) are subject to termination at the discretion of the client, which is discussed in greater detail in Item\u00a01A - Risk Factors. In such situations, our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination. Cost-Reimbursable Contracts Cost-reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The profit element may be in the form of a simple mark-up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee, or a combination of a mark-up and a fee. The fee element can also take several forms. The fee may be a fixed amount; it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred; or it may be an incentive fee based on targets, milestones, or performance factors defined in the contract. Fixed-Price Contracts Fixed-price contracts include both \u201clump sum bid\u201d contracts and \u201cnegotiated fixed-price\u201d contracts. Under lump sum bid contracts, we typically bid against competitors based on client-furnished specifications. This type of pricing presents certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Additionally, it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients, which is contrary to our relationship-based business model. Accordingly, lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract. In contrast, under a negotiated fixed-price contract, we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client. Negotiated fixed-price contracts frequently exist in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project. Thus, although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client, the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us in our services contracts as well as construction. However, because of economies that may be realized during the contract term, both negotiated fixed-price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts. The Company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts.\u00a0In recent years, most of our fixed-price work has been either negotiated fixed-price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for design and/or project services, rather than turnkey construction. Competition We compete with many companies across the world including technology consulting, federal IT services, aerospace, defense and engineering firms. Typically, no single company or companies dominate the markets in which we provide services, and in many cases we partner with our competitors or other companies to jointly pursue projects. AECOM, Booz Allen, CACI, KBR, Leidos, ManTech, Parsons, SAIC, Tetra Tech, WSP, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Accenture, Altair, Stantec, Montrose, Capgemini, Cognizant, DXC Technology, Fluor, 3LHarris, EPAM Systems, Globant, Endava, Exponent, IBM, Infosys, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, Perficient, Procure, ICF International, TTEC and Huron are some of our competitors. We compete based on the following factors, among others: technical capabilities, reputation for quality, price of services, safety record, availability of qualified personnel, and ability to timely perform work and contract terms.  Our People  Our people and our culture are fundamental to what truly makes Jacobs. Authentic leadership and a commitment to living our core values every day creates a culture of trust, respect and empowerment across our business to help us deliver the best outcomes for all our stakeholders. Together, we deliver extraordinary solutions for a better tomorrow and live by our employee value statement: \"Jacobs. A world where you can.\" Our strategy further connects our people to our purpose and helps us continue to evolve our culture to support, empower and enable our talent to thrive. Attracting, Engaging and Developing our Workforce As of September\u00a029, 2023, we had a workforce of approximately 60,000 people worldwide, including a contingent workforce of approximately 2,900 people. This represents an increase of 2% in our total workforce year-over-year.

By fostering learning and unlocking career opportunities for our people, we attract and retain the best talent to deliver for our clients and fuel long-term growth for Jacobs. Our global learning and development resources help our talent grow and develop their careers while also sharing expertise and specialized skills. Our global graduate development program and our local apprenticeships transition our future talent into our community with the skills, networks and knowledge necessary to create the foundation for a successful career at Jacobs. We provide our interns with practical, relevant \u201creal life experience\u201d to help support their professional goals. In fiscal 2023, close to 2,600 graduates, interns and apprentices were welcomed to our global team.   Our people can pursue different careers and lifelong professional opportunities at Jacobs. We promote and foster agile careers enabling employees to develop new skills and accelerate learning in different areas of our business. Our Jacobs Go! Program provides inter-regional and international six-month secondments to enhance employee experience and support their connectivity across Jacobs. In fiscal 2023, we also introduced our Returnship Program for talented professionals looking to refresh skills and reignite careers after an extended career break. As an employer of choice for diverse talent, these programs enable us to bring more innovative thought and solutions into our teams to support our clients.  Having established a baseline for our organizational health with a comprehensive Culture Survey in 2021, we are conducting shorter, periodic pulse surveys with employees to continually evaluate progress in priority areas and identify new opportunities for growth. In the most recent pulse survey, our people generally fed back that they feel included, have a sense of personal accomplishment and are likely to recommend Jacobs to a friend. We continue to make improvements in all areas including ensuring that advancement is fair and transparent.  Our unique employee experience platform \u2013 e3: engage. excel. elevate. \u2013 is not just a tool but a mindset enabling our employees to develop through continuous feedback and celebrations, aligning priorities, learning new skills and increasing knowledge. As of October 23, 2023, 87% of our employees have participated in their current annual conversation about their priorities and accomplishments. Employees also took the time to submit approximately 27,000 celebrations to recognize the work and commitment of colleagues across the business.  In addition, in fiscal 2023, 263 of our Jacobs leaders completed Amplif(i)3, a program with top-notch educators, to strengthen inspirational leadership and development of inclusive, innovative teams to enhance strategy engagement and execution across our global organization. Another successful leadership program has been our award-winning CEO Leadership Roundtable series which helps our people leaders and influencers to strengthen their leadership capabilities and grow as inspiring, impactful leaders. This past year, 8,577 Jacobs' people leaders were invited to programs led by CEO Bob Pragada. They engaged on topics such as how leaders can focus on the most important actions to lead people, and how they lead through times of professional and enterprise change. The program received a prestigious \"Gold\" Brandon Hall Group HCM Excellence Award.  We foster and encourage robust mentoring. Employees can request a mentor through e3 in our mentor match programs. Our eight Jacobs Employee Networks (JENs) offer mentoring programs that connect members with leaders who understand the unique challenges of their journeys and provide insight and guidance for those looking to elevate their careers. Our Board of Directors is also engaged with our JENs and leadership programs, participating in panel discussions and mentoring events within the Company, and at industry events. Focus on Inclusion and Diversity Page 16 Page 16 Page 16   TogetherBeyond\u2120 is our approach to living inclusion every day and enabling diversity and equity globally. Integral to our strategy and how our culture continues to evolve, our TogetherBeyond approach supports a workplace where our people are curious, embrace different perspectives and harness new ideas to bring the innovative, extraordinary solutions clients demand from us. We know that if our people feel connected and valued and that they belong, then there is no limit to who they can be and what we can achieve together. Whether they connect through our JENs, our Communities of Practice, or in other ways, our people can collaborate and drive pivotal initiatives within Jacobs that directly impact our clients and create a workplace where everyone thrives.  Through TogetherBeyond, we tackle topics that are important to our employees such as equality, conscious inclusion and allyship. While providing training and resources to our people is important, equally effective are the regular authentic and courageous conversations our grassroots employee networks are creating around these topics. Through our JENs and other internal communities, our people play a critical role in attracting new talent into our business, helping to shape our recruiting strategies and policies, our science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) programs, and our accessibility practices.  Tangible leadership commitment and accountability helps drive our culture at Jacobs. At fiscal year-end 2023, our Board's independent directors were 55% diverse (race and gender), and our Executive Leadership Team was 71% diverse, based on self-reported data.  We hold leaders accountable to making sure that broad-based-diversity is reflected in their actions, their teams and the way we operate. Each year, our people leaders commit to meaningful inclusion and diversity (I&D) actions. Our Senior Vice Presidents and above sign our annual I&D commitment statement. Inclusive behaviors and outcomes are a formal component of all our leaders\u2019 performance and compensation reviews, and all leaders at Vice President level and above are encouraged to mentor junior members of staff, including those who have a different background from themselves. This framework supports our essential I&D priorities \u2013 such as recruiting, developing and retaining outstanding veteran talent, advancing the rights of LGBTQ+ people and creating an environment where people living with disabilities participate fully and meaningfully \u2013 and ensures that we are propelling a new generation of visionary thinkers throughout our company. We also issued our new industry-leading Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, where the interest rates payable on the bonds are tied to Jacobs' commitment to increase gender diversity in leadership positions by 2028.   An important component of these priorities is our \u201cBe Seen @ Jacobs\u201d data disclosure campaign which allows employees globally to confidentially and voluntarily report the demographic data they want to report. This helps us enhance our data reporting, giving us a holistic overview of all our talent in the business and the ability to identify and address any pay gaps or inequities that may exist. As of September\u00a029, 2023, our U.S. employees had the following race and ethnicity demographics based on self-reported data: September\u00a029, 2023All U.S. Employees (1)White66.9\u00a0%Hispanic / Latin9.9\u00a0%Black8.1\u00a0%Asian7.9\u00a0%Multiracial2.8\u00a0%American Indian or Alaska Native0.5\u00a0%Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander0.3\u00a0%Not provided3.6\u00a0%(1) Includes U.S. employee population only (excludes contingent and craft employees) September\u00a029, 2023  Our focus on creating equal opportunities within Jacobs continues as we deliver on the commitments laid out in our Global Action Plan for Advancing Justice and Equality (the \"Action Plan\") launched in fiscal 2020.   Page 17 Page 17 Page 17   In the Action Plan, we continue to work toward our five-year target of investing $10 million by 2025 to support charitable donations aligned with the Action Plan pillars, further STEAM outreach efforts to historically underrepresented groups, increase our support of diverse suppliers, and strengthen our commitment to developing and hiring the best diverse talent. In fiscal 2023, we invested more than $1.7 million toward this commitment. We are supporting several Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCUs), including Howard University where the Jacobs Equity and Advancement Program, a scholarship program and student engagement plan, provides monetary supplement to STEAM education, as well as opportunities for research, mentorship and continued STEAM outreach. We've also donated $1 million to support SEED School of LA County in South Los Angeles supporting at risk students. Additionally, we\u2019re supporting the Cowrie Scholarship Foundation\u2019s mission to graduate 100 disadvantaged Black Britons through U.K. universities in the next decade and we're working with 20/20 to help racially underrepresented people to access career and business development opportunities. We're also partnering with Tent\u2019s LGBTQ+ Refugee Mentorship Initiative, pairing Jacobs mentors with LGBTQ+ refugees fleeing persecution. In fiscal 2023, we ranked in the top 75 employers of Social Mobility Foundation's Employer Index 2023.  Another key success story driven by the Action Plan is our ongoing commitment to supplier diversity, part of the Action Plan\u2019s goal to \u201ccontribute to structural change in the broader society\u201d. We are focusing on intentionally working with small or disadvantaged businesses across the globe, inclusive of minority and veteran owned businesses, and are working on quantifying diverse supplier spend. While industry benchmarks for supplier diversity currently average around 7.2% of total spend, in fiscal 2023 we spent $2.18 billion on diverse, minority-owned and disadvantaged businesses, representing approximately 34.35% of our total supply chain spend. As of September\u00a029, 2023, our global employees had the following gender demographics based on self-reported data: September\u00a029, 2023(1)WomenMenAll employees31.0%69.0%(1) Excludes contingent workforce and craft employees September\u00a029, 2023(1) 31.0% 69.0%  Total U.S. diversity (ethnicity & female) was 48.9% (excludes contingent workers and craft employees). In partnership with our Women\u2019s Network, we deliver various workforce diversity initiatives to elevate the value of women in the workplace, while fostering the next generation of professional women. Strategic efforts include tools and resources to support gender-balanced interview teams, flexible working arrangements, improved caregiver leave, and \u201cBridge the Gap\u201d, a program that actively supports parents returning to work. We are in constant communication with our employees about their healthcare needs.   In fiscal 2023, we were named one of The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality 2023, the U.K.\u2019s most highly profiled and well-established listing of employers striving for gender equality in the workplace.  In fiscal 2023, our U.S. university hiring demographics show hires of 39% female, 57% male, and 4% undisclosed or non-binary gender, as well as 45% ethnically diverse employees. Overall U.S. hiring at Jacobs is at 37% for ethnically diverse employees (excludes contingent workers and craft employees) in 2023.  Our ACE employee network connects and empowers members living with disability, health challenges or neurodiversity, and those who provide care to others. ACE embraces the social model of disability which aims to identify and remove the social, digital, and physical barriers that create exclusion in the workplace and society in general. We again earned the top score of 100 in the 2023 Disability Equality Index, a joint initiative of the American Association of People with Disabilities and Disability:IN, the leading nonprofit resource for business disability inclusion worldwide.  Through our Careers Network, we empower every employee to maximize their potential and make Jacobs the industry leader and workplace of choice. The network organizes and supports career-enriching development and networking opportunities in all our geographies.  Our One World employee network continues to celebrate cultures around the globe and to foster global connectivity, nurturing and supporting our diverse employees and clients across all ethnicities and cultures.  We supported our Prism network to drive inclusion of our LGBTQ+ family by continuing to review healthcare plans to ensure they are inclusive, train HR specialists on transgender guidelines and establish gender-neutral restrooms. In fiscal 2023, we received the People First and Large Firm of the Year awards from Consult Australia and were named to the Straits  Page 18 Page 18 Page 18   Times\u2019 Singapore\u2019s Best Employers for 2023. We again ranked No. 6 in Stonewall\u2019s U.K. Workplace Equality Index (WEI) Top 100 Employers List for LGBTQIA+ People and retained Stonewall\u2019s Gold Award.  Through VetNet, our employee network for veterans, their families and current military reserve members, we continue to work to recruit, develop and retain the best military and veteran talent, partnering with key organizations like Hiring Our Heroes. We were proud to be honored as a 2023 VETS Indexes 4 Star Employer, recognizing our commitment to recruiting, hiring, retaining, developing and supporting veterans and the military-connected community.  Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on inclusion, belonging and diversity by: \u2022Continuing progress through our global Action Plan for Advancing Justice and Equality \u2022Striving to achieve our aspirational goals of creating a more gender-balanced and a more racially/ethnically diverse workforce around the globe to more closely reflect the labor markets and communities in which we live and serve  \u2022Amplifying our culture of belonging and helping all employees see the various communities they can engage with at Jacobs so that everyone has a sense of belonging \u2022Following through on our priority areas identified through our global employee culture pulse surveys \u2022Identifying, developing and promoting allies across Jacobs \u2022Continue our data sharing campaign and enhance data reporting \u2022Continue to grow the diversity of talent for early career to experience staff through our graduates, interns, apprentices and STEAM education opportunities \u2022Increase measurement and diversification of our supply chain to improve our impact. Our Employees\u2019 Wellbeing and Resilience We believe in a comprehensive approach to our employees\u2019 resilience that covers physical, emotional, financial and social dimensions. Our programs, tools and benefits prioritize our people, equipping them with the resources and support they need to excel in all aspects of life. Our new global financial counseling benefit is designed to help our employees manage their finances confidently and be financially resilient, both in the present and the future. Additionally, our partnership with Carrot provides inclusive fertility healthcare and family-forming benefits for all paths to parenthood. We've also expanded our parental leave policies in the U.S. to further support our growing families.   We support the emotional resilience of our people and communities through our \"One Million Lives\" initiative, developed with global mental health professionals, where we offer a free and accessible mental health check-in tool. Since its launch in December 2020 to fiscal year end 2023, over 40,000 check-ins have been completed. Our e3 Learning platform empowers employees with self-guided learning opportunities in wellbeing and related topics. To ensure continued mental wellbeing, we have a network of dedicated Positive Mental Health Leads and an employee volunteer community of 2,036 Positive Mental Health Champions, with one in every 29 employees being an active champion.  Organizationally, as global challenges to our security, wellbeing and ability to operate evolve, we stay focused on managing risks effectively and building our resilience by leveraging our Culture of Caring\u2120 to deliver the best outcomes for our people, the environment and our company. Our BeyondZero\u00ae program continues to drive a safer, more secure, healthier, and more resilient future for our Jacobs family, our communities and the environment. Our business continuity program to assure business delivery and resilience continues to prove its effectiveness in an ever-changing operational environment. Jacobs\u2019 Strategic Risk Analysis capability is a coordinated program for the identification, collation and analysis of threat intelligence and information. It enables relevant reporting among operational and strategic contextualization for effective guidance, strategic contemplation and critical business decision-making processes. Despite numerous climate-related and other global events, Jacobs has successfully maintained business continuity throughout our operations. The physical resilience of our employees at work is demonstrated though our commitment to safety excellence with another year of zero employee fatalities at work and a total recordable incident rate1 of 0.20, compared to the North American Industry Classification System\u2019s most recently reported2 aggregate rate of 0.60.   Our enhanced Global Travel Assistance program in partnership with our Global Assistance & Response provider, International SOS, helps keep our employees safe and healthy while traveling or on assignment outside their home country.  Even in challenging global circumstances, our dedication to humanitarian efforts remains resolute. Our employees actively support humanitarian relief through Collectively, our global giving and volunteering program, which enables them to make donations and volunteer their time to natural and climate-related disaster recovery and relief campaigns, water security  Page 19 Page 19 Page 19   and scarcity, and the impacts of conflicts around the world. Jacobs proudly extends our Employee Assistance Program to support Ukrainian refugees who are hosted by Jacobs employees as household members.   1 As of October 15, 2023 and recorded in accordance with OSHA record keeping requirements, but subject to change thereafter due to possible injury/illness classification changes. The TRIR calculation uses the US OSHA formula of \u2018Number of Incidents x 200,000 / total number of hours worked in a year\u2019. The 200,000 is the benchmark established by OSHA because it represents the total number of hours 100 employees would log in 50 weeks based on a 40-hour work week. 2 Cited on September 14th, 2023 via U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - Incidence rates of non-fatal occupational injuries  and illnesses by industry and case types, 2021 for NAICS code 54133 Information About Our Executive Officers The information required by Paragraph (a), and Paragraphs (c)\u00a0through (g)\u00a0of Item\u00a0401 of Regulation S-K (except for information required by Paragraph (e)\u00a0of that Item to the extent the required information pertains to our executive officers) and Item\u00a0405 of Regulation S-K is set forth under the caption \u201cMembers of the Board of Directors\u201d in our definitive proxy statement to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Regulation 14A within 120 days after the close of our fiscal year and is incorporated herein by reference.
