We source a significant amount of our raw potatoes under both strategic, long-term grower relationships and short-term annual contracts. In the U.S., most of the potato crop used in our products is grown in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. In Europe, growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. We also have potato growing regions in Canada, China, Australia, and Argentina that support our processing facilities in those countries. We believe that the grower networks to which we have access provide a sufficient source of raw potato inputs year-to-year. We source edible oils through strategic relationships with key suppliers, and we source packaging and energy inputs through multiple suppliers under a variety of agreement types.\u200bThe prices paid for these raw materials, as well as other raw materials used in making our products, generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. The prices of raw materials can fluctuate as a result of these factors.\u200bDuring fiscal 2023, we continued to face increased costs for our primary raw materials, including potatoes, edible oils, packaging, grains, starches, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through long-term relationships, contract strategies, and hedging activities where an active market for an input exists, as well as through our pricing and productivity initiatives.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further discussion. \u200b Manufacturing \u200b We operate 26 production facilities for our products. See \"Item 2. Properties\" for more information about our production facilities. In addition to our own production facilities, we source a portion of our products under \u201cco-packing\u201d agreements, a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies. We regularly evaluate our co-packing arrangements to ensure the most cost-effective manufacturing of our products and to utilize company-owned production facilities most effectively. \u200b International Operations  \u200b At May 28, 2023, we had operations in 31 countries, with sales support in each of these countries and production and processing facilities in 8 countries. See Note 13, Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in \u201cPart II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information on our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Also see \u201cItem 2. Properties,\u201d for more information on our production and other facilities. For a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the U.S., see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.  \u200b Competition \u200b The value-added frozen potato products industry in North America, Europe and other international markets is highly competitive.\u00a0Competitors include large North American and European frozen potato product companies that compete globally, as well as local and regional companies. Significant competitors include Agristo NV, Aviko B.V., Cavendish Farms Corporation, Clarebout Potatoes NV, Farm Frites International B.V., J.R. Simplot Company, The Kraft Heinz Company, and McCain Foods Limited. Some of our competitors are larger and have substantially more financial, sales and marketing, and other resources than us. We compete with producers of similar products on the basis of, among other things, customer service, value, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, price, and the ability to identify and satisfy customer preferences. The markets in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. See also \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 Industry Risks \u2013 Increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits\u201d of this Form 10-K. \u200b 6 6 6  Table of ContentsSeasonality\u200bOur product contribution margin percentage, inventory levels, net sales, and cash flows are affected by seasonality. In general, our product contribution margin percentage tends to be highest in our fiscal third quarter, reflecting the cost benefit of freshly-harvested potatoes. We typically harvest potatoes in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. and Europe in July through October, which is primarily in our fiscal second quarter. While the quality of potatoes affects production efficiency, overall, freshly-harvested potatoes process more efficiently in our production lines and are not subject to storage or secondary transport costs. We typically hold 50 to 90 days of finished goods inventory on a first-in-first-out basis, so the costs incurred from our fiscal second quarter harvest, which are generally favorable, will flow through our income statement in our fiscal third quarter. Inventory levels also tend to be higher in our fiscal third quarter, requiring more working capital at that time. In general, net sales and cash flows tend to be higher in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting customer and consumer buying patterns.\u200bDue to severe impacts of the government mandated shutdowns in response to COVID-19, seasonal variation in the demand for our products in fiscal 2021 differed from prior and subsequent years.\u200bHuman Capital Resources\u200bWe believe that our employees and our workplace culture are among our most important assets, and that our employees are integral to our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. Attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent globally with the right skills to drive our mission, vision, and values are central components of our strategies for long-term growth. As of July 17, 2023, we had approximately 10,300 employees, of which approximately 2,600 employees work outside of the U.S. As of July 17, 2023, approximately 30% of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements with terms that we believe are typical for the industry in which we operate. Most of the union workers at our facilities are represented under contracts that expire at various times over the next several years. Of the hourly employees who are represented by these contracts, 51% are party to a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire over the course of the next twelve months. As the agreements expire, we believe they will be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to the parties.\u200bHealth and Safety\u200bOur employees\u2019 health, safety, and well-being are our highest priority. We strive for world-class safety at every one of our facilities. This means we continuously focus on creating a zero-incident culture, where every employee goes home every day, accident free. To help achieve this goal, we foster safety leadership throughout the organization as part of our comprehensive environment, health, safety, and sustainability management system. Through ongoing communications, routine assessments of our safety programs, safety and job-related training, daily risk assessments at facilities, defined standards, and safety measures, we strive to improve our safety performance each year. \u200b7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Seasonality\u200bOur product contribution margin percentage, inventory levels, net sales, and cash flows are affected by seasonality.

We are committed to equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or other personal characteristics. As part of this commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider various factors such as an employee\u2019s role and experience, job location, and performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay. In addition to base salaries, many employees also participate in an annual short-term incentive program and may also receive long-term equity awards. Benefits for U.S. employees include an employee savings 401(k) plan and company matching contributions, health insurance, disability insurance, life insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, wellness incentives, annual on-site health screenings, paid time-off, family leave, parental leave, employee assistance programs, and tuition reimbursement opportunities. Benefits for employees outside of the U.S. vary by country but are generally market competitive and representative of prevalent local company sponsored benefit programs. We have also adopted a hybrid work policy for office-based employees intended to allow employees flexibility in work location while maintaining productivity and performance expectations. Eligibility for, and the level of, compensation and benefits vary depending on an employee\u2019s full-time or part-time status, work location, job and career level, and tenure with the Company. We regularly review our compensation and benefit programs with the aim of keeping them competitive and designed to meet our employees\u2019 health and wellness needs, which we believe is important to attract and retain the best available talent.\u200bDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d)\u200bAs a global company, we strive to honor and celebrate diversity in our team, which we believe enriches our work lives and drives diversity of perspectives in our decision-making as a company.

We are committed to providing a work environment that fosters respect, inclusion, fairness, and dignity, and is free of harassment, discrimination, or fear of retaliation. In fiscal 2023, we launched our first business resource groups, which are voluntary, team member-led groups that bring employees together aligned around affinity areas. We believe these groups help create community and build inclusion. We have three business resource groups centered on women, multiculture and young professionals.

We use recruitment vehicles, including partnerships with universities and communities, local and national organizations, and various social media outlets, to attract strong talent to our organization. Our leadership and people teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. Specifically, we promote employee development by regularly reviewing strategic positions and identifying potential internal candidates to fill those roles, evaluating job skill sets to identify competency gaps, and creating developmental plans to facilitate employee professional growth. We invest in our employees through training and development programs, including both custom internal training and external learning resources, utilizing both live and virtual learning experiences, on the job experiences, rotational assignments, annual and mid-year manager reviews and coaching. These offerings are designed to position employees to execute with excellence in their current roles, accelerate their learning curves, and grow their careers by taking advantage of continuing learning opportunities. For example, in our production facilities, we provide multiple training sessions focused on quality and safety. We also hold courses focused on leadership development for employees and people leaders across our global organization.

To understand employee sentiments, we conduct a bi-annual engagement survey of our global workforce. This survey was completed in fiscal 2022 and was administered and analyzed by an independent third-party. The survey results were then reviewed by our executive leadership team and our Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the Board of Directors. Department leaders were also given the engagement survey results and tasked with taking action based on their employees\u2019 anonymous feedback (both quantitative and qualitative).
