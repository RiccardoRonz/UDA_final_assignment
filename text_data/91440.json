The decision to finance through Snap-on or another financing source is solely by election of the customer. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap-on considers various factors regarding ability to pay, including the customers\u2019 financial condition, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience, and credit bureau and proprietary Snap-on credit model information, as well as the value of the underlying collateral. Snap-on offers financing through SOC and the company\u2019s international finance subsidiaries in most markets where Snap-on has franchise operations. Financing revenue from contract originations is recognized over the life of the underlying contracts, with interest or finance charges computed primarily on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts. Markets Sales and Distribution Snap-on markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world. The two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector. Vehicle Service and Repair Sector The vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups: (i)\u00a0professional technicians who purchase tools, diagnostics, and equipment products for use in their work; (ii)\u00a0other professional customers related to vehicle repair, including owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealerships who purchase tools, diagnostics, and equipment products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility; and (iii)\u00a0OEMs. Snap-on provides innovative tool, equipment and business solutions, as well as technical sales support and training, designed to meet technicians\u2019 evolving needs. Snap-on\u2019s mobile tool distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools at their place of business with minimal disruption of their work routine. Snap-on also provides owners and managers of repair shops, where technicians work, with tools, diagnostics, equipment, and repair and service information, including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products. Snap-on\u2019s OEM facilitation business provides OEMs with products and services including special and essential tools as well as consulting and facilitation services, which include product procurement, distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs. The market for vehicle service and repair is driven by an increasing rate of technological change, car and truck population growth and increasing unit life, and the resulting effects of these changes on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers. In recent years, there has been an increase in the development and sales of electric and hybrid vehicles and this trend is expected to continue.  Snap-on has historically benefited from the increasing complexity of car and truck fleets and the changing tools, technologies and data needed to monitor, calibrate, service and repair evolving vehicle platforms.  While new technologies, including those associated with alternative energy drivetrains and greater vehicle autonomy, may alter the nature of certain service and repair for particular vehicle types, we believe many of these new technologies provide opportunities to fulfill requirements for enhanced solutions or increased precision.  Snap-on believes it is well-positioned to innovate new products to address these changing needs and to extend its leadership position in the expanding vehicle service and repair market sector. Industrial Sector Snap-on markets its products and services globally to a broad cross-section of commercial and industrial customers, including maintenance and repair operations; manufacturing and assembly facilities; various government agencies, facilities and operations, including military operations; schools with vocational and technical programs; aviation and aerospace operations; oil and gas developers; mining operations; power generation operations, including those associated with alternative energies; equipment fabricators and operators; railroad manufacturing and maintenance; customers in agriculture; infrastructure construction companies; and other customers that require instrumentation, service tools and/or equipment for their products and business needs. The industrial sector for Snap-on focuses on providing value-added products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers in critical industries.   8SNAP-ON INCORPORATED 8SNAP-ON INCORPORATED 8SNAP-ON INCORPORATED 8   The industrial sector is characterized by a highly competitive environment with multiple suppliers offering either a full line or industry-specific portfolios for tools and equipment. Industrial customers increasingly require specialized solutions that provide repeatability and reliability in performing tasks of consequence that are specific to the particular end market in which they operate. Snap-on believes it is a meaningful participant in the industrial tools and equipment market sector. Distribution Channels Snap-on serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution: (i)\u00a0the mobile van channel; (ii)\u00a0company direct sales; (iii)\u00a0distributors; and (iv)\u00a0e-commerce. The following discussion summarizes Snap-on\u2019s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Mobile Van Channel In the United States, a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through Snap\u2011on\u2019s mobile franchise van channel. Snap-on\u2019s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners, generally providing weekly contact at the customer\u2019s place of business. Franchisees\u2019 sales are concentrated in hand and power tools, tool storage products, shop equipment, diagnostics, and repair information products, which can be transported in a van or trailer and demonstrated during a sales call. Franchisees purchase Snap-on\u2019s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee. U.S. franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee\u2019s sales route. Snap-on\u2019s franchisees also have the opportunity to add a limited number of additional franchises. Snap-on charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees.\u00a0Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non-refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training, marketing and product promotion programs, and technology support), is recognized as the fees are earned. Franchise fee revenue totaled $18.4 million, $17.3 million and $16.2 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Snap-on also has a company-owned route program that is designed to: (i)\u00a0provide another pool of potential field organization personnel; (ii)\u00a0service customers in select new and/or open routes not currently serviced by franchisees; and (iii)\u00a0allow Snap\u2011on to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees. As of\u00a02022 year end,\u00a0company-owned routes comprised approximately 4% of the total route population. Snap-on may elect to increase or reduce the number of company-owned routes in the future. In addition to its mobile van channel in the United States, Snap-on has franchise distribution models in certain other countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Germany, Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand, Belgium and Ireland. In many of these markets, as in the United States, purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as repair shop owners and managers. As of 2022 year end, Snap-on\u2019s worldwide route count was approximately 4,725, including approximately 3,400 routes in the United States. Through SOC, financing is available to U.S. franchisees, including financing for van leases, working capital loans and loans to help enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise or the expansion of an existing franchise. In many international markets, Snap-on offers a variety of financing options to its franchisees and/or customer networks through its international finance subsidiaries.\u00a0The decision to finance through Snap-on or another financing source is solely at the customer\u2019s election. Snap-on supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices, franchise performance teams, customer care centers and distribution centers. Snap-on also provides sales and business training, and marketing and product promotion programs, as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through SOC and the company\u2019s international finance subsidiaries, all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales. National Franchise Advisory Councils in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees, assist Snap-on in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program. Company Direct Sales A significant proportion of shop equipment sales in North America under the John Bean, Hofmann, Blackhawk, Car-O-Liner, Challenger and Pro-Cut brands, diagnostic products under the Snap-on brand, and information and shop management products under the Mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts.\u00a0As the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates (with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers), Snap-on believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostics, equipment, and services.\u00a0Snap-on also sells these products and services directly to OEMs and their franchised dealers. 2022 ANNUAL REPORT9 2022 ANNUAL REPORT9 2022 ANNUAL REPORT9 9   Snap-on brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers worldwide through both industrial sales associates and independent distributors. Selling activities focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and integrated solutions. As of 2022 year end, Snap-on had industrial sales associates and independent distributors primarily in the United States, Canada and in various European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, Asian and African countries, with the United States representing the majority of Snap-on\u2019s total industrial sales. Snap-on also sells software, services and solutions to the automotive, commercial, heavy duty, agriculture, power equipment and power sports segments. Products and services are marketed to targeted groups, including OEMs and their dealerships, fleets and individual repair shops. To effectively reach OEMs, which frequently have a multi-national presence, Snap-on has deployed focused business teams globally. Distributors Sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from Snap-on and resell them to end users. Hand tools marketed under the BAHCO, Irimo, Lindstr\u00f6m, CDI, ATI, Fastorq, Norbar, Sioux, Sturtevant Richmont and Williams brands and trade names, for example, are sold through distributors worldwide.  Asset and tool control solutions are sold under the AutoCrib brand primarily through distributors worldwide.  Wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including Hofmann, John Bean, Car-O-Liner, Challenger, Pro-Cut, Cartec, Blackhawk and Ecotechnics. Diagnostics and equipment products are marketed through distributors in South America and Asia, and through both a direct sales force and distributors in Europe under the Snap-on, Sun and Blue-Point brands. E-commerce Snap-on offers current and prospective customers online access to research and purchase products through its public website, www.snapon.com. The site features an online catalog of Snap-on hand tools, power tools, tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to customers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. E-commerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the one-on-one relationships and service Snap-on has with its current and prospective customers. Sales through the company\u2019s e-commerce distribution channel were not significant in any of the last three years. Competition Snap-on competes on the basis of its product quality and performance, product line breadth and depth, service, brand awareness and imagery, technological innovation and availability of financing (through SOC or its international finance subsidiaries). While Snap-on does not believe that any single company competes with it across all of its product lines and distribution channels, various companies compete in one or more product categories and/or distribution channels. Snap-on believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools, tool storage, diagnostics, equipment products, and repair software and solutions, offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces. Various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile tool distribution channel. Snap-on also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to vehicle service and repair technicians online and through retail stores, vehicle parts supply outlets and tool supply warehouses/distributorships. Within the power tools category and the industrial sector, Snap-on has various other competitors, including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein. Major competitors selling diagnostics, shop equipment, and information to vehicle dealerships and independent repair shops include OEMs and their proprietary electronic parts catalogs and diagnostics and information systems, and other companies that offer products serving this sector. Resources Raw Materials and Purchased Product Snap-on\u2019s supply of raw materials, including steel, and purchased components are generally available from numerous suppliers and the company continuously works to expand and enhance supplier relationships to meet its supply needs. Snap-on believes it has secured a sufficient amount of raw materials and purchased components for the near future to meet the expected general sales demand. While the company does experience raw material and component cost fluctuations, as well as availability variations from time to time and from operation to operation, including due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global supply chain, Snap-on endeavors to employ its RCI processes to improve efficiencies and reduce waste to minimize the impact of any cost increases.  The company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2023 from raw material and purchased component cost or availability issues.   10SNAP-ON INCORPORATED 10SNAP-ON INCORPORATED 10SNAP-ON INCORPORATED 10   To date, the company has not observed any meaningful supply shortages or cost increases directly or indirectly resulting from climate change factors.  Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Snap-on vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to safeguard its intellectual property and position in its markets. As of 2022 year end, Snap-on and its subsidiaries held approximately 870 active and pending patents in the United States and approximately 2,780 active and pending patents outside of the United States. Sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of Snap-on\u2019s revenues in any of the last three years. Examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include hand tools (including sealed ratchets and ratcheting screwdrivers), power tools, wheel alignment systems, wheel balancers, tire changers, vehicle lifts, tool storage, tool control, collision measurement, test lane equipment, brake lathes, electronic torque instruments, emissions-sensing devices and diagnostic equipment. Much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain. Snap-on relies primarily on trade secret protection for proprietary processes used in manufacturing. Methods and processes are patented when appropriate. Snap-on leverages trade secret and other protections, as well as contractual arrangements and confidentiality procedures, for its proprietary software and other innovative solutions. Copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate. Trademarks used by Snap-on are of continuing importance in the marketplace. Trademarks have been registered in the United States and many other countries, and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending. Snap-on vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks. Snap-on\u2019s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others; however, these products under license do not represent a material portion of Snap-on\u2019s net sales. Domain names are a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world, including Snap-on. Domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property. The recognition and value of the Snap-on name, trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company. Snap-on strategically licenses the Snap-on brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel and a variety of other goods, in order to further build brand awareness and market presence for the company\u2019s strongest brand. Government Regulations Snap-on is subject to various federal, state and local laws, such as those related to international trade, data privacy, tax and government contracts, as well as environmental laws, ordinances, regulations, and requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. At Snap-on, environmental liabilities are managed through the Snap-on Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (\u201cEH\u00a0& SMS\u201d), which is applied worldwide. The system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018, verified through Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Certification, Inc. Snap-on believes that it complies with applicable environmental and government requirements in its operations. Expenditures on environmental and governmental matters through EH\u00a0& SMS have not had a material effect upon Snap-on\u2019s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, the increasing global focus on climate change may result in new or more stringent environmental or climate-related regulations or standards.  While such regulations have historically created select opportunities for our business operations, the company continually monitors developments in this area. Human Capital Management As of December 31, 2022, Snap-on employed approximately 12,900 people worldwide, of which approximately 7,200 were employed in the United States and approximately 5,700 were outside the United States.  Based on Snap-on\u2019s most recently filed EEO-1 data, which is available under \u201cESG Reporting\u201d in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of the company\u2019s website at www.snapon.com, females constitute 26.0% and minorities constitute 23.5% of the company\u2019s workforce in the United States.  Additionally, on a global basis, approximately 2,600 employees are represented by unions and/or covered under collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates through 2025.  In recent years, Snap-on has not experienced any significant work slowdowns, stoppages or other labor disruptions.   2022 ANNUAL REPORT11 2022 ANNUAL REPORT11 2022 ANNUAL REPORT11 11   Snap-on is guided by the beliefs and values in the company\u2019s \u201cWho We Are\u201d mission statement and strives to be the \u201cemployer of choice\u201d for its current and future associates.  Our \u201cWho We Are\u201d beliefs serve as the guidepost against which we evaluate performance in operating reviews throughout the company.  Furthermore, through our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, a suite of principles we use every day, the company remains committed to the areas of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and RCI, which are closely linked to and contribute to improving employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency.    Successful execution of our way forward is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team, which we achieve through the following:  \u2022Snap-on believes strongly in workplace safety.  As a permanent priority agenda item at all operational meetings, safety comes first.
