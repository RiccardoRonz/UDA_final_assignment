Our purpose, vision and values comprise the Cognizant agenda.  In order to achieve this vision and support our clients, we are continuing to focus our business on four strategic priorities to increase our commercial momentum and accelerate growth. These strategic priorities include:  \u2022Accelerating digital - growing our digital business organically and inorganically; \u2022Globalizing Cognizant - accelerating the growth of our business in key international markets and diversifying our leadership, capabilities and delivery footprint; \u2022Increasing our relevance to our clients - leading with thought leadership and capabilities to address clients' business needs; and \u2022Repositioning our brand - improving global brand recognition and becoming better known as a global digital partner to the entire C-suite.

Additionally, we pursue select strategic acquisitions that can expand our talent, experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries. In 2022, we completed two such acquisitions to complement the 16 acquisitions we completed during 2020 and 2021. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

A loss of a significant client or a few significant clients in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment. The services we provide to our larger clients are often critical to their operations and a termination of our services would typically require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues. Nevertheless, the volume of work performed for specific clients may vary significantly from year to year.  See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to disaggregation of revenues by client location, service line and contract-type for each of our reportable business segments.   Services and Solutions Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, quality engineering and assurance, application maintenance, infrastructure and security as well as business process services and automation. Additionally, we develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products and platforms. Central to our strategy to align with our clients\u2019 need to modernize is our continued investment in digital, with a focus on four key areas: IoT, digital engineering, data and cloud. These four capabilities enable clients to put data at the core of their operations, improve the experiences they offer to their customers, tap into new revenue streams, automate operations, defend against technology-enabled competitors and reduce costs. In many cases, our clients' new digital systems are built on the backbone of their existing legacy systems, which can increase complexity and impact business continuity. In the post-pandemic environment, our clients have a sustained need to modernize their businesses, which has led to increased demand for digital capabilities such as mobile workplace solutions, e-commerce, automation, AI and cybersecurity services and solutions. We believe our deep knowledge of our clients' infrastructure and systems provides us with a significant advantage as we work with them to build new digital capabilities to make their operations more modern and intuitive. We deliver all of our services and solutions across our four reportable business segments to best address our clients' individual needs.  Our services and solutions are organized into four integrated practices to simplify our operating model and better serve our clients through integrated solutioning and delivery. These integrated practices are Core Technologies and Insights, Enterprise Platform Services, Intuitive Operations and Automation, and Software and Platform Engineering. Our consulting professionals have deep industry-specific expertise and work closely across our practices to create intuitive operating models that leverage a wide range of digital technologies across our clients\u2019 enterprises to deliver higher levels of efficiency, new value for their customers and business outcomes that align to their industries. Core Technologies and Insights Our Core Technologies and Insights integrated practice helps clients build agile and relevant organizations that apply the power of cloud, data, software, and IoT to help them perform better and innovate faster. Our clients are able to harness data securely in cloud-first architectures, enabling them to become highly resilient enterprises that are capable of quickly adapting to market dynamics.

Intellectual Property, Certain Trademarks, Trade Names and Service Marks We provide value to our clients based, in part, on our proprietary innovations, methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other IP assets. We recognize the importance of IP and its ability to differentiate us from our competitors. We seek IP protection for many of our innovations and rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our IP. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, and domain names to protect our brands, including our Cognizant brand, which is one of our most valuable assets. We own or are licensed under a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights of varying duration, relating to our products and services. We also have policies requiring our employees to respect the IP rights of others. While our proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular IP right or any particular group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses, other than our Cognizant brand. Cognizant\u00ae and other trademarks appearing in this report are registered trademarks or trademarks of Cognizant and its affiliates in the United States and other countries, or third parties, as applicable.  This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes trademarks and service marks owned by us. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains trademarks, trade names and service marks of other companies, which are the property of their respective owners.

We aim for our employees to feel motivated, engaged, and empowered to do their best work through careers they find meaningful. In a market where competition for skilled IT professionals is intense, we focus on the following:  \u2022Engagement & Retention: We regularly monitor employee engagement and retention levels, and assess employee sentiment through third-party engagement surveys, leader listening sessions and interactions on our internal channels. On an annual basis, after each engagement survey, we develop and communicate clear action plans to continue to build on our strengths and address shortfalls. In 2022, we saw meaningful increases in our employee engagement results, including scores above benchmark across multiple categories.  Competition for skilled employees in the current labor market is intense, and we experienced significantly elevated attrition during 2022. We continue to enhance our employee value proposition and our pay-for-performance approach as well as increase our efforts with respect to recruitment, talent management and employee engagement. For the three months ended December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, our annualized attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 25.3% and 34.6%, respectively. Our attrition rate for the years ended December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 31.7% and 30.8%, respectively. \u2022Advancing Diversity & Inclusion: We strive to continually improve upon D&I over the long term. A diverse and inclusive workforce strengthens our ability to innovate and to understand our clients\u2019 needs and aspirations. Highlights from our D&I efforts include:  \u2013Global D&I organization embedded within our HR function to drive accountability through our people processes and systems; \u2013Global D&I training and programs, including allyship, psychological safety, and inclusive mindset training for leaders; \u2013Progressive hiring policies and initiatives: \u2022a diverse candidate pipeline initiative to ensure a more diverse interview slate at the Vice President level and above; \u2022our Returnship Program, a 12-week paid, immersive experience for experienced professionals who have taken an extended career break; \u2013Seven global affinity groups sponsored by Executive Committee members that welcome, nurture and provide safe spaces in which our employees can share their unique interests and aspirations; \u2013For the first time in 2022, Executive Committee compensation included a metric focused on gender diversity globally, and developing and retaining talent. In addition, every leader at the level of director and above has a goal for hiring and retaining women at the senior manager level and above in their business area; \u2013Our sponsorships with the PGA, LPGA, where we doubled the Cognizant Founders Cup purse, and the Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One Team, where we partnered with Racing Pride to promote LGBTQ+ inclusivity in motor racing, demonstrate our commitment to equality and furthering diversity and inclusion around the world; and \u2013In 2022, Cognizant earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index, a foremost benchmarking survey related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality.
