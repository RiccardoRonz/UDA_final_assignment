For further information on sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further discussion regarding risks related to customer concentration. COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS We compete with many companies in the defense, intelligence and federal civil markets. The Boeing Company, General Dynamics, L3Harris Technologies, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon Technologies are some of our primary competitors. Key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition, which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the number of bid protests (competitor protests of U.S. government procurement awards). It is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor, serve as a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa. SEASONALITY No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. -5- -5- -5- NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION  NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION  BACKLOG At December 31, 2022, total backlog, which is equivalent to the company\u2019s remaining performance obligations, was $78.7 billion as compared with $76.0 billion at December 31, 2021. For further information, see \u201cBacklog\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (MD&A) and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We routinely apply for and own a number of U.S. and foreign patents related to the technologies we develop. We also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to third parties and we license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property from third parties. The U.S. government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property. RAW MATERIALS We have experienced challenges with access to certain raw materials due to macroeconomic factors and several global events such as microelectronics shortages, COVID-19 and geopolitical conflicts. In some cases, these challenges have significantly increased the cost and/or lead time required to obtain certain raw materials. Nonetheless, these challenges have not to date materially impacted our ability to perform on our contracts. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials.  HUMAN CAPITAL Fostering a culture that offers employees opportunities to live our values, deliver for our customers, and act responsibly and sustainably is central to our diverse and talented workforce. Our culture and values enable us to continue attracting qualified talent, particularly those with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas, including science, technology, engineering and math. During 2022, despite facing a tight labor market, this focus on our culture and workforce was a factor in our ability to hire approximately 16,000 new employees, and as of December 31, 2022, we have approximately 95,000 employees.  Additional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Report and Proxy Statement, which can be found on our company website. Information on our website, including our ESG Report (formerly our Sustainability Report), is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. Our Values and Culture Our values reflect our priorities and form the bedrock of our culture:  \u2022We do the right thing \u2013 we earn trust, act with ethics, integrity and transparency, treat everyone with respect, value diversity and foster safe and inclusive environments. \u2022We do what we promise \u2013 we own the delivery of results, focused on quality. \u2022We commit to shared success \u2013 we work together to focus on the mission and take accountability for the sustainable success of our people, customers, shareholders, suppliers and communities.  \u2022We pioneer \u2013 with fierce curiosity, dedication and innovation, we seek to solve the world\u2019s most challenging problems. We believe our culture and values are vital to the ongoing success of the company, including our ability to attract and retain a talented and diverse workforce. Our values are also integral to our commitment to long-term sustainability, with robust ESG practices across our company. The company has a Standards of Business Conduct program. Our employees are empowered to raise concerns without fear of reprisal. In addition to full-time ethics professionals, we also have over 140 business conduct advisors who promote values and an ethical culture within the company. Our annual engagement survey gives employees a voice and a mechanism to provide feedback on our culture. This survey is managed by a third-party vendor to encourage employee candor on key engagement drivers, including company leadership, culture, inclusion and career development. In 2022, 79 percent of employees responded to the survey, an indication that our employees believe their feedback matters, and we were named a \u201cHigh Performing  -6- -6- -6- NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION  NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION  Company\u201d by the third party vendor based on our survey results. Our leaders review the survey responses and work collaboratively with their teams to take meaningful actions based on survey results. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) is vital to our culture and our company\u2019s success. Our ability to leverage the power of our diverse workforce enhances employee engagement and enables us to innovate, perform and deliver on quality, which results in value for our shareholders, customers, and employees. Diversity is one of the company\u2019s non-financial ESG performance metrics and is reviewed by the Board of Directors. Across our U.S. employee population, as of December 31, 2022, 25 percent are female, 37 percent are people of color, 18 percent are veterans and 8 percent are persons with disabilities. At the vice president level, 34 percent are female and 19 percent are people of color.  Talent Management  Northrop Grumman\u2019s talent strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our people and our business. We are focused on providing an end-to-end experience from pre-hire to retirement. This includes creating inclusive, employee-centric experiences, cultivating leadership, offering multiple development pathways and expanding the talent pipeline into and through the company. We hold regular talent review discussions to ensure line of sight to talent at various levels of the organization. Succession plans are refreshed and reviewed to ensure a robust, diverse pipeline of talent and business continuity with a tight linkage to development.  We focus on accelerating learning and development of our leaders by providing a combination of experiences and education. Our Leading for Impact Program offers developmental paths for new and experienced managers seeking to refresh or build their leadership capabilities. Nearly 3,000 leaders have honed their skills leveraging various learning modalities, including virtual and in-person instructor-led, web-based training and micro-courses to support our managers. Our employee development programs are designed to strengthen employee skills that align to our current and future business needs, encourage knowledge sharing and support career progression and growth. We utilize My Learning Experience, a machine learning enabled content aggregator designed to create a unique and personalized learning experience for each employee. We offer our employees online career-specific tools and resources and we also support development opportunities through educational institutions with our Education Assistance Program. Our early-in-career rotation program, Pathways, develops talent pipelines with both depth of skills and breadth of experiences that are critical to the company\u2019s future talent needs. Our technical cohort programs are uniquely designed to cultivate technical, domain expertise and collaborative thought leadership for early through advanced career levels. As our company continues to grow, we rely on an integrated talent acquisition approach.

In order to accomplish our goals, we seek talent with unique perspectives, skills and experiences; maintain strategic relationships with colleges; offer a robust employee referral program; and partner with numerous diversity organizations, military organizations and trusted external partners, with a commitment to growing and supporting a diverse talent pipeline. Amidst the evolving and, at times, challenging hiring environment, we apply agile recruiting methods as we work to adapt to the changing labor marketplace and to ensure employees and candidates have an exceptional experience. Employee Health and Safety People are our most valuable resource, and we work diligently to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers, visitors and others at our facilities. During 2022, we have taken, and continue to take, robust actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to help protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees and others. See \u201cCOVID-19\u201d in MD&A for further discussion.  Health and safety are a core focus in everything we do. Risk and hazard identification, abatement and prevention are key components of Northrop Grumman\u2019s safety program. Everyone has a responsibility to identify workplace hazards and we empower employees to report these hazards without fear of repercussion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our health and safety programs externally, through benchmarking with industry peers and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Internally, we determine program effectiveness by conducting trend analyses of our past performance.  -7- -7- -7- NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION  NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION  Collective Agreements  Approximately 4,000 employees are covered by 15 collective agreements in the U.S., of which we negotiated four renewals in 2022 and expect to negotiate one renewal in 2023.  See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further discussion regarding risks related to our workforce and employee relations.  REGULATORY MATTERS Government Contract Security Restrictions We are prohibited by the U.S. government from publicly discussing the details of certain classified programs. These programs are generally referred to as \u201crestricted\u201d in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements and financial information in this Annual Report reflect the operating results of our entire company, including restricted programs. Contracts We generate the majority of our business from long-term contracts with the U.S. government for development, production and support activities. Unless otherwise specified in a contract, allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the U.S. government pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which are regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts. Examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the U.S. government in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements include, but are not limited to, unallowable employee compensation, charitable donations, interest expense, advertising, and certain legal and travel costs. We monitor our contracts on a regular basis for compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable government laws and regulations. In addition, costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S.\u00a0government are routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). Our long-term contracts typically fall into one of two contract types: Cost-type contracts \u2013 Cost-type contracts include cost plus fixed fee, cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts. Cost-type contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a contractor\u2019s allowable costs incurred plus fee. As a result, cost-type contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation. Fees on cost-type contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or can be variable due to award and incentive fees, which are generally based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality and/or technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company\u2019s performance against contractual criteria. Incentive fees are generally based on cost or schedule and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs or as schedule milestones are met. Award and incentive fees are included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. Fixed-price contracts \u2013 Firm fixed-price contracts include a specified scope of work for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated amount and not typically subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor, absent changes by the customer. As a result, fixed-price contracts typically have more financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth, but provide the opportunity for higher profit margins. Certain fixed-price incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor\u2019s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount, typically through a cost-sharing ratio that affects profitability. These contracts effectively become firm fixed-price contracts once the cost-share ceiling is reached. Time-and-materials contracts are considered fixed-price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged. Profit margins on our contracts may vary materially depending on, among other things, the contract type, contract phase (e.g., development, low-rate production or mature production), negotiated fee arrangements, achievement of performance objectives, unexpected macroeconomic factors or other circumstances, and cost, schedule and technical performance. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further information regarding our contracts and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for sales by contract type. -8- -8- -8- NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION  NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION  The following table summarizes sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, recognized by contract type and customer category: $ in millionsU.S.Government(1)International(2)Other CustomersTotalPercentageof\u00a0Total SalesCost-type contracts$18,110\u00a0$594\u00a0$7\u00a0$18,711\u00a051\u00a0%Fixed-price contracts13,213\u00a04,254\u00a0424\u00a017,891\u00a049\u00a0%Total sales$31,323\u00a0$4,848\u00a0$431\u00a0$36,602\u00a0100\u00a0% U.S. Government(1) International(2) (1)Sales to the U.S. government include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. government.
