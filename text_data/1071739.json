Focus on the IndividualWhole HealthActive Local InvolvementEmpowering people to create and maintain lifelong healthy habitsDelivering a full spectrum of care from physical health to emotional wellnessHelping our neighbors create stronger, healthier communities     Who We Are  Our mission as a leading healthcare enterprise is to help people live healthier lives, with an established expertise in lower-income and medically complex populations. We provide access to high-quality healthcare, innovative programs, and a wide range of health solutions that help families and individuals get well, stay well, and be well. We believe that our local approach enables us to provide accessible, quality, culturally sensitive healthcare coverage to our communities.  We have a competitive advantage being on the ground, enabling us to establish strong relationships with our partners and providing us with first-hand knowledge, which enables us to provide the best possible care to our members. We have a commitment to the communities and people we serve to transform their health at the local level.  Our value creation efforts, initiated in mid-2021, are the foundation of our long-term strategy, focused on making strategic decisions and investments to create additional value in the short-term and to seek opportunities that position the organization for long-term strength, profitability, growth, and innovation. In addition to creating shareholder value, this plan is an ongoing effort to modernize and improve how we work in order to propel our organization to new levels of success and elevate the member and provider experiences.  During 2022, we operated in two segments: Managed Care and Specialty Services. Our Managed Care segment provided health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized and commercial programs. Our Specialty Services segment included companies offering diversified healthcare services and products to our Managed Care segment and other external customers. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, our Managed Care and Specialty Services segments accounted for 93% and 7%, respectively, of our total external revenues. Our membership totaled 27.1 million as of December\u00a031, 2022. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, our total revenues and net earnings attributable to Centene were $144.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and our total cash flow from operations was $6.3 billion.  In early 2023, and in conjunction with our updated strategic plan, executive leadership realignment, and corresponding 2023 divestitures, we have revised the way we manage the business, evaluate performance, and allocate resources, resulting in an updated segment structure comprised of (1) a Medicaid segment, (2) a Medicare segment, (3) a Commercial segment and (4) an Other segment. We will begin reporting under this new segment structure in 2023.  Our initial health plan commenced operations in Wisconsin in 1984. We were organized in Wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"CNC.\"  1 1 1 Table of Contents Table of Contents  INDUSTRY  We provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial products.  Medicaid  Medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the United States and provides health insurance to low-income families and individuals with disabilities. Medicaid is funded jointly by federal and state governments, with the majority of funding provided by the federal government and administered by the states. Each state establishes its own eligibility standards, benefit packages, payment rates, and program administration within federal standards. As a result, there are 56 Medicaid programs - one for each U.S. state, each U.S. territory, and the District of Columbia. Eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets, often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level. Many states have selected Medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs.  Medicaid helps meet the needs of various populations through the following products and programs:  \u2022The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program covers low-income families with children.  \u2022Medicaid Expansion covers all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, subject to each states' election. The federal government pays 90% of the costs for Medicaid Expansion coverage for these beneficiaries.  \u2022The Aged, Blind, or Disabled (ABD) program covers low-income individuals with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments. ABD beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all Medicaid recipients and typically utilize more services as a result of their more complicated health status.  \u2022The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) helps to expand coverage primarily to children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough to afford private health insurance. Historically, children have represented the largest eligibility group. Costs are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care, which tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues predominantly affecting the adult population.   \u2022Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) is a Medicaid product that covers Institutional/Residential Care (Nursing and Intermediate Care Facilities) and Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living. The largest groups receiving LTSS, by spending, are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities, followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, those with serious mental illness and/or serious emotional disturbance, and other populations. States are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated, holistic care to their LTSS beneficiaries.  \u2022The majority of children in foster care qualify for Medicaid. The federal government has enacted legislation establishing requirements for state child welfare agencies related to the health and well-being of children in foster care, including the provision of grants and technical assistance to enable states to meet these needs and make explicit connections with Medicaid. In addition, under the ACA, former foster care children are eligible for Medicaid until the age of 26, provided that they turned 18 while in foster care and were enrolled in Medicaid at that time.  \u2022A portion of Medicaid beneficiaries are dual-eligible, low-income seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare. According to the CMS, there were approximately 11.6 million dual-eligible enrollees in 2021. These members may receive assistance from Medicaid for benefits, such as nursing home care, HCBS, and/or assistance with Medicare premiums and cost-sharing depending on their income level. Dual-eligibles use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues. We serve dual-eligibles primarily through our ABD, LTSS, Medicare-Medicaid Plan (MMP), and Medicare Advantage Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (DSNP) lines of business.  While Medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage, they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the Medicaid population tends to access healthcare. Medicaid recipients in non-managed care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes. Rather, they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency departments, which is typically more expensive. As a result, many states without managed care programs have found that the costs of providing Medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory. 2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents   Accordingly, in an effort to improve quality of care and lower costs, the majority of states have mandated that their Medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans and are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach for additional populations and products. CMS estimates the total Medicaid market will grow from $700\u00a0billion in 2021 to $1.1\u00a0trillion by 2029. Medicaid spending is estimated to have increased by 5.7% in 2022 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 5.6% between 2021 and 2030. Based on these trends, we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations (MCOs) with operations and programs focused on the distinct socio-economic, cultural, and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the Medicaid populations.  We are the largest Medicaid health insurer in the country, serving 16\u00a0million Medicaid recipients in 29 states as of December\u00a031, 2022.  Medicare  Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people ages 65 and over, which was expanded to cover people under 65 with certain disabilities and people with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or kidney transplant. Medicare consists of four parts, labeled A through D. Part A provides hospitalization benefits financed largely through Social Security taxes and requires beneficiaries to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Part B provides benefits for medically necessary services and supplies including outpatient care, physician services, and home health care. Parts A and B are referred to as Original Medicare.  As an alternative to Original Medicare, beneficiaries may elect to receive their Medicare benefits through Part C, also known as Medicare Advantage. Under Medicare Advantage, MCOs contract with CMS to provide services directly to Medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups. MCOs typically receive fixed monthly premium per member from CMS that varies based upon the county in which the member resides, demographic factors of the member such as age, gender, and institutionalized status, and the health status of the member. Any benefits that are not covered by Medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from CMS that may be allocated to these benefits, according to CMS regulations and guidance.  CMS estimates the total Medicare market will grow from $865\u00a0billion in 2021 to $1.5\u00a0trillion by 2029. Medicare spending is estimated to have increased 7.5% in fiscal 2022 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 7.2% between 2021 and 2030. More than half of Medicare eligible members in 2022 were not enrolled in a Medicare Advantage product, representing a notable market opportunity.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we served 1.5\u00a0million Medicare Advantage members across 36 states, primarily under the brand name WellCare, with the highest concentration of lower-income, medically complex members compared to our competitors.  Medicare Prescription Drug Plan  Medicare prescription drug coverage, or Medicare Part D, is a voluntary benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit is supported by risk sharing with the federal government through risk corridors designed to limit the losses and gains of the participating drug plans and by providing reinsurance for catastrophic drug costs. The government subsidy is based on the national weighted average monthly bid for this coverage, adjusted for risk factor payments. Additional subsidies are provided for dually-eligible beneficiaries and specified low-income beneficiaries.  MCOs contract with CMS to serve as plan sponsors offering stand-alone Medicare Part D PDPs to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. PDPs offer national in-network prescription drug coverage, including a preferred pharmacy network, subject to limitations in certain circumstances. Unless CMS is notified of non-renewal and the non-renewal is effectuated by not filing a bid on the first Monday in June, Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts with CMS are renewed for successive one-year terms each September. Should CMS decide not to renew a contract, CMS must notify MCOs on or before August 1, and the plan would be terminated effective December 31 of that year.  We offer stand-alone PDPs in 50 states and the District of Columbia, serving 4.2\u00a0million members as of December\u00a031, 2022.  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Commercial  The ACA created the Health Insurance Marketplace, which is a key component of the ACA and provide an opportunity for individuals and families to obtain health insurance. States have the option of operating their own Marketplace or partnering with the federal government. States choosing neither option default to a federally-facilitated Marketplace. Access to the Marketplace is limited to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants. Insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with coverage that varies based on premiums and out-of-pocket costs.  Premium subsidies, extended through 2025, are provided to individuals and families without access to other coverage and with incomes above 100% of the federal poverty level to make coverage more affordable. Consumers who qualify for subsidies may choose how much of the tax credit to apply to their premiums each month, up to the maximum amount for which they are eligible. The amount of subsidy an enrollee may receive depends on household income and the cost of the second lowest cost silver plan available to enrollees in their local area.  We also offer commercial healthcare products to individuals through large and small employer groups. We offer plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of co-payments at different premium rates. These plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians, hospitals, and other providers. Coverage typically is subject to copays and can be subject to deductibles and coinsurance. As our commercial members reach their deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, our medical costs rise, creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year.  We are the largest Marketplace carrier, serving 2.1\u00a0million members across 27 states as of December\u00a031, 2022, under the brand name Ambetter Health.  OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS  Our approach is based on the following key competitive strengths:   \u2022Expertise in Government-Sponsored Programs. For more than 35 years, we have developed a specialized services expertise that has helped us establish and maintain relationships with members, providers, and our government customers. Our products are tailored to achieve savings for our government customers and are designed to enable our providers to deliver high-quality care to members. Complex populations represent a larger share of our Medicaid portfolio, more than any other payer in the country. As states increasingly look to a managed model for these populations, we believe we will be seen as a must-have partner.  \u2022Localized Approach with Centralized Support Infrastructure. We take a localized approach to delivering healthcare. This approach enables us to facilitate member access to high-quality, culturally sensitive healthcare services. Our product designs are tailored to the unique populations in each community and address community-specific challenges through outreach, education, transportation, and other member support activities. We complement this localized approach with a centralized infrastructure. We believe this combined approach enables a culture that protects local agility and innovation while delivering scaled efficiency.  \u2022Financial Strength and Scale. We are the largest Medicaid health insurer and Marketplace carrier in the country and our growing Medicare product has the highest concentration of lower-income, medically complex members. In 2022, we had $144.5 billion in revenue and $6.3 billion in operating cash flow. Our strong operating performance, size, and scale allow us to continue to invest in our businesses through technology, strategic acquisitions, and key resources that support our business and enable us to navigate the changing healthcare landscape.  \u2022Data-Driven Innovation. Our rich, local data amassed over decades allows us to curate networks of community partners and community resources, identify low-cost, sustainable interventions tailored to our unique populations, and guide high-impact investments into the community. We are investing in scalable innovation and transformation to harness our data. In this way, our data will enable us to transform the health of our communities long-term and deliver value to both members and shareholders.   4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents  MANAGED CARE  Benefits to Customers  We feel that our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs, and from our specialized programs with state governments.  The following are among the benefits we provide to our government partners, providers, and members:  \u2022Accurate and timely claims payments. We are committed to ensuring that our information systems and claims payment systems meet or exceed state requirements. We continuously improve our claims processing strategies, expertise, configuration, and tools to achieve operational excellence, including timely payments to our providers.  \u2022Care management for complex populations. Through our experience with Medicaid populations and long-time presence in states with experience in long-term care for children and adolescents in the foster care system, we have developed care management, service coordination, and crisis prevention/response programs that improve healthcare outcomes through decreasing preventable emergency department utilization and improving access to primary care and behavioral health intervention. This experience has led to sole source and specialized contracts in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, Texas, and Washington.  \u2022Commitment to quality and improved health outcomes. We have implemented programs to encourage effective and transparent collaboration between the member and their provider. We demonstrate this through obtaining health plan accreditations, such as National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), which is a critical step in demonstrating the effectiveness of our structure and processes, clinical quality, and member satisfaction. Additionally, we have launched a multi-year plan to build and improve quality across the enterprise with a strong focus on enhanced patient experience and access to care, which lays the foundation for strong Medicare Star ratings in the future.  \u2022Community-specific healthcare programs and a focus on addressing health equity. Our expertise in government-sponsored programs has helped us establish and maintain strong relationships with our constituent communities of members, providers, and federal and state governments. We provide access to services through local providers and staff that focus on the cultural norms of their individual communities. To that end, systems and procedures have been designed to address community-specific challenges, including but not limited to, food insecurity, housing instability, employment, and access to transportation, which contribute to health disparities among underserved and vulnerable populations. We remain focused on identifying and removing social barriers to health in the communities we serve.  \u2022Data-driven approach to improve health outcomes. We have employed an investment strategy designed to increase our capability to collect and analyze data and insights. We gather data from multiple sources including medical, vision, and behavioral health claims and encounter data, pharmacy data, dental vendor claims, and authorization data. We use this data to track utilization trends, identify health disparities, monitor quality of care, and evaluate the effectiveness of our programs. Through these analyses, we identify and implement interventions that improve health outcomes, advance health equity and population health, and ensure members receive timely and appropriate services. The value and accuracy in the data we collect is important in demonstrating an auditable program for federal and state agencies.  \u2022Member programs and services. Our comprehensive set of programs and services help members achieve whole-person health while supporting the overall goals of the government program. Covered healthcare benefits vary from customer to customer but cover a wide range of services, including transportation assistance, provision of durable medical equipment, behavioral health and substance use disorder services, 24-hour nurse advice line, social work services, and telehealth services.  \u2022Value-based arrangements. Our health plans offer a combination of value-based contracting models, including quality incentives and risk arrangements, that address the continuum of whole-person care. We believe value-based collaboration with providers leads to improved health outcomes, reduced costs, and better member and provider experiences.   5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Providers  For each of our service areas, we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians, hospitals, and ancillary providers. Our network of primary care physicians is a critical component of care delivery, cost optimization, and the attraction and retention of new members. Primary care physicians include family and general practitioners, pediatricians, internal medicine physicians, obstetricians, and gynecologists. Specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by primary care physicians. Specialty care physicians include a wide array of provider types including, but not limited to, orthopedic surgeons, cardiologists, and otolaryngologists. When necessary, we also contract with third-party providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy, home healthcare, diagnostic laboratory tests, x-ray examinations, transportation, ambulance services, and durable medical equipment.  Our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers. Our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals are usually for a term of one to three years and renew automatically for successive one-year terms, but generally are subject to termination by either party upon prior written notice. In the absence of a contract, we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels, depending on the product (e.g., Medicaid or Medicare). We pay providers under a variety of methods, including fee-for-service, capitation arrangements, and value-based arrangements.   \u2022Under our fee-for-service contracts with providers, we pay a negotiated fee for covered services. This model is characterized as having no financial risk for the provider.   \u2022Under our capitated contracts, providers can be paid a set amount for their services as outlined in their respective provider agreements. A provider group's financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us, even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group. Depending on state law and the regulatory environment, it may be necessary for us to pay such claims.  \u2022Under value-based arrangements, providers can be paid under either a capitated or fee-for-service model. The arrangement, however, contains provisions for additional payments to the providers or reimbursement from the providers based on their performance in cost and quality measures. We are committed to value-based contracting, up and downside risk, assigning members to the highest quality providers and capitation. This is done in complete partnership with our providers to increase quality outcomes and overall member satisfaction. We anticipate our membership in up and downside risk arrangements will continue to grow.  The continuum of value-based contracting includes the following models: pay-for-performance, shared savings, shared risk, and full risk. We often start our provider relationships in a pay-for-performance model, in which providers are reimbursed for the fair market value of services provided. Providers benefit from this model as it gives complete transparency and clarity on actions that earn incentives.   We then transition to a risk-sharing model, in which providers are reimbursed based on the total cost of care. As we advance along this continuum, it strengthens our partnerships with our providers, enabling the delivery of high-quality care. We believe having the strongest provider partners who know how to operate well in a value-based model and who can help us drive positive outcomes for our members and good member experience is more important than owning providers, which occurs on an exception basis.  We work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing actionable financial and utilization information, physician and patient educational programs, and disease and population health management programs. Our programs are also designed to help physicians coordinate care rendered by other providers.  We believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets. Our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs, optimizing costs, and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members, while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers. This approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention which, in turn, has helped to increase our membership base.   6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents  The following are among the services we provide to support physicians:  \u2022Provider Engagement Performance Tools and Processes lead to measurable improvements in quality and health outcomes, healthcare costs, and member satisfaction. High-quality provider support and service levels are important as our key customers are increasingly using performance-based measures to select and pay health plans. We have a suite of network performance tools for use by physicians and other providers which monitor the outcomes and care gaps of their individual patient panels. We meet with the providers to review their performance issues and recommend strategies for improvements in their patient panel outcomes. Our tools also allow the physician and others to see where they stand within their value-based contract.  \u2022Our Integrated Care Model is member-centric and managed by one care manager assigned to a member who looks at the care for the member in a holistic manner. This single care manager will coordinate all care for that member including behavioral health, medical health, and home-based primary care in accordance with an individualized, integrated care plan. This care manager also coordinates meetings with the member's integrated care team to assess and alter the care plan as needed. This results in better clinical outcomes and improved member satisfaction.  \u2022The Provider Portal delivers claims and eligibility research, prior authorizations, member panels, care gaps, patient analytics, and provider analytics to contracted providers to drive provider engagement and improve patient outcomes. Data and reporting are delivered via a secure, user-friendly web-based provider portal. This is provided through our suite of technology platforms.  Our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members and population health management programs, which assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic diseases.  Quality Management  Quality management represents an integral part of our organization's foundation. Ensuring we continue advancing our mission of achieving better health outcomes for our members has led to recent investments in key initiatives involving people, processes, technology, and partner management.  Through these initiatives, we have:  \u2022brought in key talent to the Company with a focus on individuals who have been successful in driving improvement in other organizations and increased staffing in critical customer-facing areas;  \u2022centralized the oversight of quality programs, including the implementation of real-time operational dashboards, tracking numerous quality key performance metrics;  \u2022invested in new technology to enhance our access to clinical data around gaps in care, committed to integrating our numerous quality platforms into a single unified workflow, and developed advanced analytics to orchestrate pivotal member engagement and increase positive clinical outcomes and satisfaction in the care being delivered to our members; and  \u2022taken steps to strengthen relationships with providers to improve the quality of care for our members; specifically, we are increasing our value-based provider engagements as those enhanced partnerships have proven to drive higher quality care and continue to promote local physician participation in quality improvement through physician committees chaired by local physician leaders, which ensures clinical oversight and is critical to the success of clinical quality improvement programs.   We believe these initiatives will improve the member's overall health and healthcare experience and help us achieve strong Medicare Star ratings.  CMS developed the Medicare Advantage Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers choose among competing plans, awarding between 1.0 and 5.0 stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality. The parent organization Star rating is used for new Medicare Advantage contracts while existing contracts follow their individual Star ratings to determine bonus payments.  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Plans receive additional Medicare revenue related to the achievement of higher Star ratings that can be used to offer more attractive benefit packages to members and/or achieve higher profit margins. In addition, plans with Star ratings of 5.0 are eligible for year-round open enrollment, whereas plans with lower Star ratings have more restrictions on enrollment criteria and timing. Part C or Part D Medicare plans with Star ratings of less than three stars for three consecutive years are denoted as \"low performing\" plans on the CMS website and in the CMS \"Medicare and You\" handbook. In addition, CMS could exercise its authority to terminate the Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts for plans rated below three stars for three consecutive years. As a result, plans that achieve higher Star ratings may have a competitive advantage over plans with lower Star ratings.  As further validation of our quality objectives, we pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality. NCQA Health Plan Accreditation programs provide unbiased, third-party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics. We pursue and achieve accreditation in the majority of states where we currently have health plan operations. We also verify the credentials and backgrounds of our partner providers using standards supported by NCQA to ensure the quality of our networks.  Accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members. State and market Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts. This reporting is monitored by health plan quality improvement committees and our corporate population health management and quality improvement teams.  We remain committed to our quality initiatives and continue to focus on investments that we expect to translate into value over the next few years.  SPECIALTY SERVICES\u00a0  Our specialty companies provide a variety of products and services to deliver integrated healthcare to our members and other organizations.  \u2022Behavioral Health. Magellan Health Inc. (Magellan) provides carve-out management services for behavioral health and employee assistance plans. These services are provided through Magellan's comprehensive network of medical and behavioral health professionals, clinics, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home care agencies, and ancillary service providers.  \u2022Clinical Healthcare. Community Medical Group (CMG) provides clinical healthcare, encompassing primary care, access to certain specialty services, and a suite of social and other support services. CMG operates in Florida through an at-risk primary care provider model, focusing on clinical and social care for at-risk beneficiaries. Additionally, Bayless Integrated Healthcare provides outpatient primary care and behavioral healthcare services.  \u2022Data Analytics. Apixio offers, among other solutions, artificial intelligence technology that performs retrospective chart reviews for more accurate risk score submission to CMS. Apixio provides services to third-party customers as well as our health plans. Interpreta uses its analytics engine to provide real-time insights to providers, care managers, and payers in the areas of member prioritization, quality management, and risk adjustment. These businesses continue to digitize the administration of healthcare and accelerate innovation and modernization across the enterprise.  \u2022Federal Services. Health Net Federal Services has a Managed Support Contract in the West Region for the Department of Defense (DoD) TRICARE program. We provide administrative services to Military Health System eligible beneficiaries, which includes eligible active duty service members and their families, retired service members and their families, survivors of retired service members, and qualified former spouses. Our current contract for health care delivery services is in place through early 2024. In December 2022, the DoD announced that the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contracts commencing in 2024 were not awarded to Health Net Federal Services.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents  \u2022Pharmacy Solutions. Utilizing innovative, flexible solutions and customized care management, we offer traditional pharmacy clinical and administrative services as well as comprehensive specialized pharmacy benefit services through our specialty pharmacy business, AcariaHealth. Our programs offer progressive services\u00a0that are specifically designed to improve quality of care\u00a0while containing costs. Services that we provide include drug utilization review, formulary and rebate management, patient and physician interventions, and prior authorization services and analytics. AcariaHealth offers specialized care management services for complex diseases and enhances the patient care offering through collaboration with providers and the capture of relevant data to measure patient outcomes. We have historically provided comprehensive PBM services, however, we have transitioned substantially all of our PBM business to a third party as of January 1, 2023. We continue to provide pharmacy benefit administration for state Medicaid and other government-sponsored programs through Centene Pharmacy Services.  \u2022Vision and Dental Services. Envolve Benefit Options coordinates benefits beyond traditional medical benefits to offer fully integrated vision and dental health services. Our vision benefit program administers routine and medical surgical eye care benefits through a contracted national network of eye care providers. Through the dental benefit, we are dedicated to improving oral health through a contracted network of dental healthcare providers.  We currently have NCQA accreditation and/or URAC accreditation for several of our specialty services companies.  CORPORATE COMPLIANCE  Our Ethics and Compliance program assists the organization in developing effective internal controls that promote the prevention and detection of fraud, waste and abuse and the resolution of instances of conduct that do not conform to federal and state law, private payor healthcare program requirements, or our ethics and business policies. Responsibilities also include the ongoing maintenance of our privacy program and oversight of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as they pertain to us and our business units from a compliance, business, and technical perspective.  Three standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the Federal Organizational Sentencing Guidelines, the CMS Chapter Guidance, and the Compliance Program Guidance series issued by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General. Our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by these authorities.  These key components are:  \u2022written standards of conduct;  \u2022designation of compliance officers and compliance committees; \u2022effective training and education; \u2022effective lines for reporting and communication; \u2022enforcement of standards through well-publicized disciplinary guidelines and actions; \u2022internal monitoring and auditing; and \u2022prompt response to detected offenses and development of corrective action plans.   The goal of our program is to build a culture of integrity, ethics, and compliance, which is assessed periodically to measure engagement and effectiveness. Our Corporate Compliance intranet site, accessible to all employees, contains our Compliance Program description, our Business Ethics and Code of Conduct Policy, and resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions. If needed, employees have access to the contact information for our Board of Directors' Audit and Compliance Committee Chairman to report concerns. Our Ethics and Compliance Helpline is a toll-free number and web-based reporting tool operated by a third-party independent of the Company and allows employees or other persons to anonymously report suspected incidents of misconduct, fraud, waste, abuse, or other compliance violations, concerns, or questions. Furthermore, our Board of Directors' Audit and Compliance Committee reviews ethics and compliance reports quarterly.  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, HEALTH, GOVERNANCE AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY  Our steadfast commitment to the environment, the health and social well-being of our communities, and our culture of sound and ethical corporate governance extends far beyond individual programs or initiatives. Through the delivery of high-quality healthcare to at-risk populations, our responsibilities to members, stakeholders, and our planet serve as a living expression of our purpose \u2013 transforming the health of communities, one person at a time. Continued focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters remains foundational to supporting our strategy and long-term value creation. The services and value we provide to improve the lives of our members are essential to our business model. Our focus on the whole health of our members by delivering a full spectrum of care, including continually enhanced social determinants of health services, has allowed us to become a national leader in healthcare. These themes are core to our Environmental, Social, Health, and Governance (ESHG) Strategic Framework (the Framework), which highlights our commitment to healthy individuals and healthy communities and builds upon our long history of identifying and removing barriers to health. Implementation of the Framework is overseen by the Board of Directors Governance Committee and ESHG initiatives throughout the organization are driven by a cross-functional network comprised of executive representatives.  Annually, we issue an ESHG Report to the Community to communicate the value of our ESHG efforts, a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Index report outlining our governance structure, strategy, risks, opportunities, and metrics and target-setting related to managing climate change, and a Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) index report aligned with the SASB Managed Care standard, providing sustainability disclosures to our stakeholders. The Framework enables us to align our business strategy and long-term planning with our initiatives and commitments to protect our planet, serve our communities, cultivate healthier lives, and live our values. Interested parties can find our ESG / ESHG-related reports within the Investors section of our website, the URL of which is https://investors.centene.com/esg. Please note: Nothing on our website, including our ESG / ESHG reports or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.  COMPETITION  We operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes, including business consolidations, new strategic alliances, market pressures, and regulatory and legislative reform both at the federal and state level. This includes, but is not limited to, the federal and state healthcare reform legislation described under the heading \"Regulation.\" In addition, changes to the political environment may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape.   We compete with other MCOs and specialty companies to acquire and retain state, county, federal, and commercial contracts. In addition, competitors could include technology companies, new joint ventures, financial services firms, consulting firms, and other non-traditional competitors. Before granting a contract, state and federal government agencies consider many competitive factors. These factors include quality of care, financial condition, stability and resources, and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish comprehensive provider networks.  We also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members. People who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered, ease of access to services, a specific provider being part of the network, and the availability of supplemental benefits. We believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered, size and quality of provider network, quality of service, responsiveness to customer demands, financial stability, comprehensiveness of coverage, diversity of product offerings, market presence, and reputation.  We also compete with other MCOs in establishing provider networks. When contracting with various health plans, we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume, reimbursement rates, population health management programs, speed of reimbursement, and administrative service capabilities. See \"Risk Factors - Competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve.\"\u00a0  The relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market, including by geography and by product. We believe that we compete effectively against other healthcare industry participants.  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents  REGULATION  Our operations are comprehensively regulated at the local, state, and federal levels. Government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. States have implemented National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model regulations, requiring governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. States have adopted these or similar measures to enhance regulations relating to corporate governance and internal controls of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file reports with state insurance regulators.  Regulatory agencies have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. Changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically, including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state and federal levels. The ultimate content, timing, or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the new administration remains uncertain.  Our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as HMOs, preferred provider organizations (PPOs), third party administrators, utilization review organizations, pharmacies, direct care providers, and/or insurance companies in their respective states. In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are regulated by the relevant health and/or human services departments, departments of insurance, boards of pharmacy and other healthcare providers, and departments of health that oversee the activities of MCOs and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees.  The process for obtaining authorization to operate as a MCO, health insurance plan, prescription drug plan, pharmacy, or provider organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plan's organizational structure, financial resources, utilization review, quality assurance programs, proper billing, complaint procedures, and an adequate provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions. For example, under both state MCO statutes and insurance laws, our health plan subsidiaries, as well as our applicable specialty companies, must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements, such as deposit and surplus requirements. Insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other MCO businesses and the payment of dividends, as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds. Our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements. In addition, each health plan and individual healthcare provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes, including, without limitation, changes to existing offerings, the development of new product offerings, certain organizational restructurings, and, in some states, the expansion of service areas.\u00a0  States have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations. These regulations in certain states include: \u2022premium taxes or similar assessments imposed on us; \u2022stringent prompt payment laws requiring us to pay claims within a specified period of time; \u2022disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures; and \u2022programs to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups.  We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states' insurance departments reports describing the capital structure, ownership, financial condition, intercompany transactions, and general business operations. In addition, depending on the size and nature of the transaction, various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies, and affiliates. Among other provisions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Additionally, the holding company regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval or an exemption, no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company that controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would \"control\" the insurance holding company. \"Control\" is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of a company.   PPO regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject areas referred to above.  Our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals, there are laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail order pharmacies to register with that state's board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body. These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located, although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state.  Our healthcare providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located. In addition, they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board, board of nursing, or other applicable entity. Furthermore, they must not be excluded from participation at either the state or federal levels. Our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care.  Federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government, such as Medicaid and Medicare programs. Our Medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies. Federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs. Federal law permits the federal government to oversee and, in some cases, to enact, regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs. Medicaid is administered at the federal level by CMS. Comprehensive legislation, specifically Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, governs our Medicare program. In addition, our Medicare contracts are subject to regulation by CMS. CMS has the right to audit Medicare contractors and the healthcare providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with CMS contracts and regulations.   The ACA transformed the U.S. healthcare system through a series of complex initiatives. Some of the ACA's most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees, assessments, and taxes, the establishment of federally-facilitated and state-based Health Insurance Marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage; the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers; and optional Medicaid Expansion. State and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the ACA, and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business. For a further discussion of the ACA, see \"Risk Factors - Significant changes or judicial challenges to the ACA could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\"  We must also comply with laws and regulations related to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. For example, money laundering is a method of attempting to conceal the origins of money gained through illegal activity and is itself a crime that can result in substantial criminal and civil sanctions including fines and imprisonment. To ensure compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, it is our policy to conduct business only with legitimate customers and counterparties whose funds are derived from legitimate commercial activity. In addition, as a result of our international operations, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. A violation of specific laws and regulations by us and/or our agents could result in, among other things, the imposition of fines and penalties on us, changes to our business practices, the termination of our contracts, or debarment from bidding on contracts.   12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents  State and Federal Businesses; Contracts  In addition to being a licensed insurance company or HMO, in order to be a Medicaid MCO in each of the states in which we operate, we generally must operate under a contract with the state's Medicaid agency. States generally either use a formal proposal process, reviewing a number of bidders, or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program. Under these state Medicaid program contracts, we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis. These rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state. In addition, several of our Medicaid contracts require us to maintain Medicare Advantage special needs plans, which are regulated by CMS, for dual-eligible individuals within the state.  We provide Medicare Advantage, PDPs, DSNPs, and MMPs which are provided under contracts with CMS and subject to federal regulation regarding the award, administration, and performance of such contracts.\u00a0CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts, as well as other CMS regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries under these contracts.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we operated in 27 states under federally-facilitated Marketplace contracts with CMS and state-based exchanges. We operate under a contract with the Arkansas Department of Human Services Division of Medical Services and the Arkansas Insurance Department to participate in the Medicaid expansion model that Arkansas has adopted (referred to as Arkansas Works).  Our government contracts include government-sponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the TRICARE program and certain other healthcare-related government contracts.  Our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth requirements for operating, including provisions relating to:  \u2022eligibility, enrollment, and dis-enrollment processes; \u2022covered services; \u2022eligible providers; \u2022subcontractors; \u2022record-keeping and record retention; \u2022periodic financial and informational reporting; \u2022quality assurance; \u2022accreditation; \u2022health education and wellness and prevention programs; \u2022timeliness of claims payment; \u2022financial standards; \u2022safeguarding of member information; \u2022fraud, waste and abuse detection and reporting; \u2022grievance procedures; and \u2022organization and administrative systems.  A health plan or individual health insurance provider's compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by CMS. A health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a third-party reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan. A health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies, including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports.  Our health plans operate through individual state contracts, generally with an initial term of one to five years. The contracts often have renewal or extension terms or are renewable through the state's reprocurement process. The contracts generally are subject to termination for cause, an event of default, or lack of funding, among other things.  Our federally-facilitated Marketplace contracts and state-based exchanges are renewable on an annual basis.  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Privacy Regulations  We are subject to various international, federal, state, and local laws and rules regarding the use, security, and disclosure of protected health information, personal information, and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle. Such laws and rules include, without limitation, HIPAA, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), the General Data Protection Regulation, and state privacy and security laws such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and the California Online Privacy Protection Act. Privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation, regulations, or administrative interpretation. A variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general, and other state regulators.  HIPAA is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage, simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information. Among the requirements of HIPAA are the Administrative Simplification provisions which include: standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions (Transactions Standards); requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information (Privacy Rule); and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained, stored or transmitted in electronic format (Security Rule). The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act amended certain provisions of HIPAA and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates. HITECH also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach, provided enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations, and granted enforcement authority to states' Attorneys General in addition to the HHS Office for Civil Rights. The HIPAA Omnibus Rule further enhanced the changes under the HITECH Acts and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 which clarified that genetic information is protected under HIPAA and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes. These regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non-compliance. The preemption provisions of HIPAA provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements.   The Privacy and Security Rules and HITECH/Omnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates.   The Security Rule requires healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored, maintained, or transmitted. The HITECH Act and Omnibus Rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached. In addition, there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for, among other things, private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization.  The requirements of the Transactions Standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using \"electronic media.\" Since \"electronic media\" is defined broadly to include \"transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data, magnetic tape, disk or compact disk media,\" many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted. Under HIPAA, health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format. Penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements. The transaction standards were modified in October 2015 with the implementation of the ICD-10 coding system.  In addition, we process and maintain personal card data, particularly in connection with our Marketplace business. As a result, we must maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard intended to optimize the\u00a0security of credit, debit, and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information.  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Other Fraud, Waste and Abuse Laws  Investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud, waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities. The focus of these efforts has been directed at Medicare, Medicaid, Health Insurance Marketplace, and commercial products. The fraud, waste and abuse laws include the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal False Claims Act. Additional fraud, waste and abuse prohibitions include a wide range of operating activities, such as kickbacks or other inducements for the referral of members or coverage of products (such as prescription drugs) by a plan, billing for unnecessary medical services by a provider, improper marketing and violation of patient privacy rights. The laws and regulations relating to fraud, waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans, PDPs, and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly. Compliance with these laws may require substantial resources. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our fraud, waste and abuse detection methods. While we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing, we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment.  HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES  As the pace of change, complexity, and uncertainty in the broader environment accelerates, we continue our strong investment in creating a purpose-driven culture. We intentionally attract, develop, and retain top talent who have diverse voices and experiences, passion, and vision well-positioned to help us transform the health of communities for those we serve. Our entrepreneurial and mission-driven workforce is anchored by a steadfast commitment to a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and safe workplace. Our employees are further enabled through robust talent development programs and supported by competitive compensation, benefits, and health and well-being programs. Finally, our workforce is emboldened by their alignment with our purpose, values, and strategy through meaningful connections between our employees and their communities.   As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 74,300 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees.  In our most recent Shaping Centene Employee Engagement pulse survey, 88% of employees reported strong engagement. Based on their responses, we surpassed the 75th percentile of Fortune 100 benchmark companies (benchmark data from 2019-2021) in a number of areas, including but not limited to the Company's commitment to and people leaders' support of diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace, and having a clear understanding of our mission and values, as measured in our annual DEI Index, People Leader Effectiveness, Culture, and Employee Engagement surveys.  Workforce Culture and Compensation and Benefits  We maintain the health and well-being of our employees as one of the main driving factors of business decisions. We offer benefits to our employees to help them achieve optimum work-life balance and meet their needs and the needs of their families.   Based on feedback from our employees, we have adopted a modern work environment, including remote and hybrid work arrangements utilized by the majority of our employees. We believe that work flexibility empowers our employees to do their best work in the way they work best. With a largely remote workforce, we are intentional in our efforts to foster a collaborative, inclusive, and engaging work environment. We create meaningful \"moments that matter,\" including monthly forums for people leaders, weekly communications for all employees, virtual all-employee meetings, and employee programming to help amplify multiple perspectives and lived experiences.  Our compensation and benefits programs are market competitive and designed to attract and retain talent. Our overall compensation philosophy is to pay for performance by linking the achievement of both Company and individual goals to total compensation. In addition to base pay, these programs may include annual bonuses, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, and a 401(k) plan. Our benefits cover various aspects of an employee's life, including medical, dental, and vision insurance, short- and long-term disability, supplemental accidental death and dismemberment and life insurance, wellness programs, flexible spending accounts, parental leave, and caregiver leave. We recently updated our parental leave to six weeks of fully compensated time for caregivers with an additional eight weeks for mothers, providing up to 14 weeks of fully compensated maternity leave. We also offer vacation, paid personal and sick time, paid company holidays, an employee assistance program, tuition reimbursement/educational assistance, and adoption reimbursement. In addition, we offer paid community volunteer time to encourage our employees to participate in individual and work-related volunteer programs and support the communities in which we serve.  15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  We believe that a diverse workforce and an equitable, inclusive environment enable competitive advantage and fuel improved service, innovation, and performance with all stakeholders. Our talent advisors, in partnership with hiring leaders, work to nurture a pipeline that connects us to a diverse workforce. Each of our talent advisors receives training to become Certified Diversity Recruiters and participate in the Association of Talent Acquisition Professionals Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Excellence Program.  We have a wide range of programs focused on early identification and accelerated development of diverse talent, including our Employee Inclusion Groups (EIGs), which are key drivers of our culture. These voluntary, employee-led groups provide professional and leadership opportunities for women, military veterans and their families, individuals with disabilities and caregivers of individuals with disabilities, LGBTQIA+, and multicultural employees. EIGs support the attraction, development, and retention of talent at all levels, contribute to community engagement initiatives, and support business innovation and corporate best practices. Today, there are over 15,000 employees participating in our EIGs.  Our DEI strategy extends beyond the workforce and emphasizes supplier diversity, community engagement, and stakeholder collaboration. As a company committed to advancing whole health in communities, we recognize that economic inclusion is vital to positive health outcomes. Accordingly, we invest and partner with organizations that share our mission and values, with a focus on small businesses that provide employment opportunities to our member population.
