{"cik": 84839, "item_1A": "Item 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business General Overview Rollins, Inc. (\u201cRollins,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), is an international services company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Through our family of leading brands, we provide essential pest and wildlife control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to more than two million residential and commercial customers from more than 800 Company-owned and franchised locations in approximately 70 countries. \u00a0Over the course of our lengthy operating history, we have garnered a reputation for providing great customer service. The contracted and recurring nature of our services provide us with visibility into a significant portion of our future earnings. In 1964, brothers O. Wayne and John Rollins acquired Orkin Exterminating Company and in 1965 we changed our name from Rollins Broadcasting, Inc to Rollins, Inc. In 1968, Rollins began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cROL.\u201d Since then, we have grown into a premier consumer and commercial services business with numerous industry leading brands including the world renowned Orkin, as well as HomeTeam Pest Defense, Clark Pest Control, Western Pest Services, Critter Control Wildlife, and Northwest Exterminating, among others. We operate under one reportable segment which contains our three business lines:   Our Competitive Strengths Rollins is a global leader in pest control. We have established a portfolio of premier brands with extensive service capabilities across a deep operating network. Our scale enables delivery of great service and provides a significant and reinforcing competitive advantage through (i) comprehensive capabilities to win new residential and commercial accounts, (ii) technology investments for operations optimization and enhanced customer experience, (iii) route density to manage variable costs, and (iv) financial flexibility to generate organic growth and pursue M&A. Robust Operating Platform with Proprietary Technology Our extensive footprint creates an efficient and scalable operating platform to facilitate exceptional customer service delivery, increased cross-selling opportunities, and cost efficiencies. We have strategically invested in proprietary routing and scheduling technologies to increase our competitive advantage, which includes real-time service tracking and customer internet communication to personalize the customer experience. We run our proprietary Branch Operating Support System (\u201cBOSS\u201d), which offers a back-end interface to facilitate service tracking and payment processing for technicians. BOSS also provides virtual route management tools to increase route efficiency across our network, reducing miles driven and associated costs while increasing customer retention through on-time and rapid response service.  Differentiated Employee Base and Service Delivery Our employees are critical to delivering an outstanding customer experience, and we are highly focused on providing our team with best-in-class training and development opportunities. We operate the 27,000 square foot Rollins Learning Center training facility located in Atlanta, GA, which is a distance-learning and global broadcast facility with simulated environments and classrooms for training. In addition to in-person training, the Rollins Learning Center offers on-demand training sessions that employees can access from anywhere in the world that are produced at our on-site, state-of-the-art broadcast studio. Our unique programs contribute to our position as an  3 3  Table of Contents\u200bemployer of choice and have earned us recognition from Training magazine among the Top 125 U.S. Training Companies 17 times in the past 20 years. We were also recognized by the Top Workplaces program as a top workplace on both a national and local level. \u00a0This marks the seventh consecutive year to be recognized in Atlanta. We continuously monitor co-worker engagement and customer loyalty.Experienced Management TeamOur management team combines extensive business and consumer services experience with robust local pest control leadership. Consistent with our culture of attracting, developing and progressing talented individuals, our senior leadership team consists of a combination of long-term internal leaders and strategic hires from well-respected external platforms. Our Chairman, Gary Rollins, is the son of Rollins, Inc. co-founder O. Wayne Rollins and has spent his entire career with the Company, serving as Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) from 2001 to 2022. Effective January 1, 2023, Jerry Gahlhoff, Jr. assumed the role of CEO and now serves as President and CEO.International BusinessWe continue to expand our international presence through organic growth, acquisitions, and our international franchise programs. In 2022, we saw revenue growth in our operations in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. We believe geographic diversity allows us to increase brand recognition, meet demands of global customers, and draw on business and technical expertise from teams in several countries, and offers us an opportunity to access new markets.Franchising ProgramsWe have franchise programs through Orkin, Critter Control and our Australian subsidiaries. We had a total of 137, 135 and 128 domestic franchise agreements as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. International franchise agreements totaled 89, 103 and 101 as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Transactions with our franchises involve sales of territories and customer contracts to establish new franchises and the payment of initial franchise fees and royalties by franchisees. The territories, customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically paid for by a combination of cash and notes. Acquisition StrategyWe have extensive experience acquiring companies of all sizes. Over the last three years, we have completed approximately 100 acquisitions, including 31 acquisitions in 2022. Our acquisition strategy targets high quality, profitable businesses with strong leadership that would benefit from incremental growth capital and have the potential to achieve margin expansion through cost and revenue synergies.Seasonality Our business is somewhat affected by weather conditions, including climate change and the seasonal nature of our pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of our pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consolidated\u00a0Net\u00a0Revenues(in thousands)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02021\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02020First Quarter\u200b$ 590,680\u200b$ 535,554\u200b$ 487,901Second Quarter\u200b\u00a0 714,049\u200b\u00a0 638,204\u200b\u00a0 553,329Third Quarter\u200b\u00a0 729,704\u200b\u00a0 650,199\u200b\u00a0 583,698Fourth Quarter\u200b\u00a0 661,390\u200b\u00a0 600,343\u200b\u00a0 536,292Year to date\u200b$ 2,695,823\u200b$ 2,424,300\u200b$ 2,161,220\u200bOur quarterly profitability correlates with our revenue due to seasonality, as profit is lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters.4 Table of Contents\u200b Table of Contents \u200b employer of choice and have earned us recognition from Training magazine among the Top 125 U.S. Training Companies 17 times in the past 20 years.

We maintain a sufficient level of products, materials, and other supplies to fulfill our immediate servicing needs and to mitigate any potential short-term shortage in availability from our national network of suppliers. We also have qualified comparable products and materials for key categories to have alternatives ready as needed. However, at any time supply chain disruptions that are more than short-term in nature could impact our levels of products, materials and other supplies.CompetitionWe operate in a highly competitive environment. The principal factors of competition in our pest and termite control markets are quality and speed of service, customer proximity, customer satisfaction, brand awareness and reputation, terms of guarantees, safety, technical proficiency and price. Due to our strong direct partnerships with product manufacturers, distributors, and visibility into the inventories, ordering and distribution of materials and supplies, we are able to foresee potential supply disruptions and to quickly adapt. The use of an innovative and industry changing distribution model and technology enables us to maintain adequate supplies for our field operations without a significant investment in warehousing and inventory. We believe that, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we compete effectively and favorably with our competitors as one of the world\u2019s largest pest and termite control companies. Our major competitors include Rentokil, Ecolab, and Anticimex.Research and DevelopmentOur expenditures on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. We utilize the relationships with our manufacturer and materials suppliers to provide new and innovative products and services, coupled with in-depth reviews by our tenured Technical Services department to ensure they meet our strict requirements. We also conduct tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products and we rely on research performed by leading universities. We maintain close relationships with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection. Some of the new and improved service methods and products are also researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies with a portion of these methods and products being produced to the specifications provided by us.Environmental and Regulatory ConsiderationsOur business is subject to various local and national legislative and regulatory enactments including, but not limited to, environmental laws, antitrust laws, employment laws (including wage and hour laws, payroll taxes and anti-discrimination laws), immigration laws, motor vehicle laws and regulations, human health and safety laws, securities laws including, but not limited to, SEC regulations, and federal, state and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and the pest and termite control industry. If we were to fail to comply with any of these applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or damages, be involved in lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities, suffer losses to our reputation and our business or suffer the loss of licenses or penalties that may affect how the business is operated, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Environmental, Health and Safety MattersSpecifically, our businesses are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal, transportation and management of hazardous substances and wastes and protect the health and safety of our employees. These laws also impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances, including releases by prior owners or operators of sites we currently own or operate. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the services we provide and subjects us to the possibility of regulatory or private actions or proceedings.5 Table of Contents\u200b Table of Contents \u200b Materials and SuppliesOur Company has relationships with a vast network of national pest control product distributors, manufacturers and other suppliers for pest and termite treatment products.

The telemarketing rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and the Federal Telemarketing Sales Rule issued by the Federal Trade Commission, along with state laws and other legal authorities, govern our telephone and texting sales practices. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates our email solicitations and the Consumer Review Fairness Act regulates consumer opinions on social media regarding our products and services. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the first of its kind and followed by the California Privacy Rights Act, and laws in other states provide consumers and sometimes employees the right to know what personal data businesses collect, how the data is used, and give them the right to access, delete and opt out of the sale of their personal information to third parties. We are subject to some of these states\u2019 laws depending on the number of customers or amount of revenue in the specific state.Franchise MattersCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to various international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations governing franchise sales, marketing and licensing and franchise trade practices generally, including applicable rules\u00a0and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission. These laws and regulations generally require disclosure of business information in connection with the sale and licensing of our franchises. Certain state regulations also affect our ability as a franchisor to revoke or refuse to renew a franchise. From time to time, we and one or more franchisees have been, and may in the future become, involved in a dispute regarding the franchise relationship, including payment of royalties or fees, location of branches, advertising, purchase of products by franchisees, non-competition covenants, compliance with our standards or franchise renewal criteria. Any such franchise dispute could possibly have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Intellectual PropertyWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio is strengthened through innovation and brand recognition, and a comprehensive approach for protection and enforcement. Risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in Item 1.A. \"Risk Factors\".We protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our rights both domestically and internationally. Although in the aggregate, our global portfolio of more than 450 trademarks is a valuable asset that is important to our operations, we believe that our competitive advantage is also largely attributable to the technical, marketing, and sales competence and capabilities of our employees, rather than on any individual trademark. Therefore, we do not consider the expiration or loss of any single trademark or intellectual property right, to be material to our business as a whole.Human CapitalWe believe one of the largest contributors to our Company\u2019s success is the quality of our people. Attracting, developing and retaining high-quality talent is the primary objective of our human capital management. The development and retention of high-quality talent leads to a better customer experience and better customer retention. We develop and engage our people through our training at all levels of our organization.As of December\u00a031, 2022, the Company had 17,515 employees. Approximately 15,800 of our employees were located in the United States, with approximately 14,700 employees at U.S. branch offices.

Risks Related to our Business, Brand, Industry and OperationsWe face risks regarding our ability to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in competitors\u2019 prices and general economic issues. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies, for a finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are quality and speed of service, customer proximity, customer satisfaction, brand awareness and reputation, terms of guarantees, safety, technical proficiency and price.

We cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition targets on terms favorable to us in the future, or that any acquisitions will achieve the anticipated financial benefits. Our inability to achieve the anticipated financial benefits from any acquisition transactions may not be realized due to any number of factors, including, but not limited to, unsuccessful integration efforts, unexpected or underestimated liabilities or increased costs, fees, expenses and charges related to such transactions. Such adverse events could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets established as a result of such transactions, triggering an impairment. These and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Expanding into international markets presents unique challenges, and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations may not be successful.An element of our business includes further expansion into international markets.\u00a0Our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political, economic and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with applicable anti-corruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future.\u00a0Risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits, maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.\u00a0Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial results.Our business depends on our strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands and develop a positive client reputation could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers.Our strong brands, Orkin, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Clark Pest Control, Northwest Exterminating, Trutech, Western Pest Services, The Industrial Fumigant Company (IFC), Waltham Services, Okolona Pest Control (OPC), Critter Control, and others, have significantly 10 Table of Contents\u200b Table of Contents \u200b uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.
