Dividends on Common Stock The Company paid cash dividends on our common stock of $32.4 million during the year ended December\u00a031, 2022.  Our Industries and Products Industrial Technologies and Services Our Industrial Technologies and Services segment designs, manufactures, markets and services a broad range of air compression, vacuum and blower products across a wide array of technologies. Compression, vacuum and blower products are used in a wide spectrum of applications in nearly all manufacturing and industrial facilities and many service and process  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents industries in a variety of end-markets, including infrastructure, construction, transportation, food and beverage packaging and chemical processing. Compression Products Sales to industrial end-markets include industrial air compression products, as well as associated aftermarket parts, consumables and services. Industrial air compressors compress air to create pressure to power machinery, industrial tools, material handling systems and automated equipment. Compressed air is also used in applications as diversified as snow making and fish farming, on high-speed trains and in hospitals. Compressors can be either stationary or portable, depending on the requirements of the application or customer. We focus on five basic types of air compression technologies: rotary screw, reciprocating piston, scroll, rotary vane and centrifugal compressors. Rotary screw compressors are a newer technology than reciprocating compressors and exhibit better suitability for continuous processes due to a more compact size, less maintenance and better noise profile. We believe our reciprocating piston compressors provide one of the broadest ranges of pressures in the market and are supported by increasing demand across wide-ranging attractive end-markets. Scroll compressors are most commonly seen where less oil-free air is needed, and is most commonly used in medical and food applications where the need for pure, clean and precise air is of great importance. Rotary vane compressors feature high efficiency, compact compression technology and can be found throughout all sectors of industry, including automotive, food and beverage, energy and manufacturing with specialized solutions within transit, gas and snow making. Centrifugal compressors are most effective when in applications that demand larger quantities of oil-free air and are utilized across a wide range of industries. Vacuum Products Industrial vacuum products are integral to manufacturing processes in applications for packaging, pneumatic conveying, drying, holding / lifting, distillation, evacuation, forming / pressing, removal and coating. Within each of these processes are a multitude of sub-applications. As an example of one such end-process, within packaging, a vacuum will be used on blister packaging, foil handling, labeling, carton erection, stacking and palletizing (placing, stacking or transporting goods on pallets), as well as central vacuum supply for entire packaging departments. We focus on five basic types of vacuum technologies: side channel, liquid ring, claw vacuum, screw and rotary vane vacuum pumps. Side channel vacuum pumps are used for conveying gases and gas-air mixtures in a variety of applications, including laser printers, packaging, soil treatment, textiles and food and beverage products. Liquid ring vacuum pumps are used for extreme conditions, which prevail in humid and wet processes across ceramics, environmental, medical and plastics applications. Claw vacuum pumps efficiently and economically generate contact-free vacuum for chemical, environmental and packaging applications. Screw\u00a0vacuum pumps are a dry running technology used to reduce the carbon footprint and life cycle costs in drying and packaging applications. Rotary vane vacuum pumps are used for vacuum and combined pressure and vacuum applications in the environmental, woodworking, packaging and food and beverage end-markets. Blower Products Blower products are used for conveying high volumes of air and gas at various flow rates and at low pressures, and are utilized in a broad range of industrial and environmental applications, including waste water aeration, biogas upgrading and conveying, pneumatic transport and dehydrating applications for food and beverage, cement, pharmaceutical, petrochemical and mobile industrial applications. In many cases, blowers are a core component for the operation of the entire end-users\u2019 systems. Management believes that we hold a leading position in our addressable portion of the global blower products market. We focus on several key technologies within blower products: rotary lobe, screw, claw and vane, turbo, side channel and radial blowers. Rotary lobe blowers, screw blowers and claw and vane blowers are positive displacement technologies that have the ability to consistently move the same volume of gas or air and vary the volume flow according to the speed of the machine itself enabling it to adapt the flow condition in a flexible manner despite pressure in the system. Turbo blowers and side channel and radial blowers are dynamic technologies that have the ability to accelerate gas or air through an impeller and transform their kinetic energy at the discharge with some limitation on flexibility. Fluid Transfer Equipment Products Fluid transfer equipment products includes fluid loading systems, tank truck and fleet fueling products and couplers. Fluid loading systems are used in the transfer and loading of hydrocarbons and certain other liquid commodity products in marine and land applications. Tank truck and fleet fueling products allow for safe transfer of liquid products without spillage or contamination while safeguarding the operator and the environment. Operators use Dry-Break\u00ae technology couplers and  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents adapters to provide a secure connection for the transfer of liquid products without spillage or contamination while safeguarding the operator and the environment. Liquid Ring Vacuum Pumps and Compressors Liquid ring vacuum pumps and compressors are designed for continuous duty in harsh environments, including vapor and flare gas recovery equipment (which recovers and compresses certain polluting gases to transmit them for further processing), primarily in downstream applications. The liquid ring technology utilizes a service liquid, typically water, oil or fuel, to evacuate or compress gas by forming a rotating ring of liquid that follows the contour of the body of the pump or compressor and acts like a piston to deliver an uninterrupted flow of gas without pulsation. Precision and Science Technologies The Precision and Science Technologies segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of flow control products for the water and wastewater, food & beverage, chemical processing, precision irrigation, energy, medical equipment, laboratory vacuum and automated liquid handling end-markets. Key technologies include positive displacement pumps, gas, liquid and precision syringe pumps, automated liquid handling systems and hydrogen refueling stations. Positive Displacement (PD) Pumps Positive displacement pumps are essential to highly specialized flow applications across many industries. We are a market leader in positive displacement, covering the main technology types including diaphragm, vane, piston, progressive cavity, peristaltic and gear. In the medical and life sciences end-market, our gas and liquid pumps are used for a wide range of applications, such as aspirators, blood analyzers, compression therapy, dialysis machines, gas monitors, ventilators, and scientific instrumentation within in vitro diagnostics and R&D laboratories. In the water and environmental end-market, our pumps and related equipment are used for water treatment in municipal and industrial facilities such as in dosing and sludge transfer. In agriculture, our pumps are used for nutrient and medicine dosing to livestock, plants and medicinals. In the emerging market of hydrogen powered vehicles, we are a leader in refueling stations that utilize our unique heritage in industrial gas compression pumps. Finally in the general industrial end-market, our pumps and accessories serve a broad range of niche applications such as in the handling of abrasive or chemically active fluids as well as gases.  Controls and Software Equipment controls and software are of increasing importance in our flow control applications for both the optimization of current systems as well as to enable the anticipated Industrial Internet of Things (\u201cIIOT\u201d) evolution. In the agriculture market, we sell controllers and software that monitor and control the main functions within livestock and greenhouse facility operations with the benefit of reducing cost and improving yield. In natural gas pipelines and distribution, we sell monitoring devices connected to cloud-based software for real time monitoring of odor injection pumping systems which enhances safety and reduces costs. Similarly, on our positive displacement progressive cavity sludge pumps, we sell monitoring devices and cloud-based software for real-time pump health and performance monitoring, which prevents costly downtime in water treatment plants as well as in industrial installations.  Robotics Our automated liquid handling products, which includes syringe pumps and accessories, are integrated into large-scale, automated liquid handling systems used within clinical, pharmaceutical and environmental applications. These automated systems provide accurate and efficient dosing, sampling and handling of critical fluids at increasingly ultra-low flow levels, which are required in lab and life science applications.  Competition Industrial Technologies and Services The industrial end-markets we serve are competitive, with an increasing focus on product quality, performance, energy efficiency, customer service and local presence. Although there are several large manufacturers of compression, vacuum and blower products, the marketplace for these products remains highly fragmented due to the wide variety of product technologies, applications and selling channels. Our principal competitors in sales of compression, vacuum and blower products include Atlas Copco AB, Flowserve Corporation, IDEX Corporation and Kaeser Compressors, Inc. Our principal competitors in sales of fluid transfer equipment include Dover Corporation, SVT GmbH and TechnipFMC plc. Our principal competitors in the sale of liquid ring pumps and compressors are Flowserve Corporation and Busch-Holding GmbH. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Precision and Science Technologies Competition in the market served by our Precision and Science Technologies segment is primarily based on product quality and performance, as most products must be qualified by the customer for a particular use. Further, there is an increasing demand for more efficient healthcare solutions, which is driving the adoption of premium and high performance systems. Our primary competitors include Dover Corporation, Graco, IDEX Corporation, KNF Neuberger, Inc., Netzsch, NOV, SPX Flow, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Watson-Marlow, Inc., as well as other regional and local manufacturers.  Customers and Customer Service We consider superior customer service to be one of our primary pillars of future success and view it as being built upon a foundation of critical application expertise, an industry leading range of compressor, pump, vacuum and blower products, a global manufacturing and sales presence and a long-standing reputation for quality and reliability. Intense customer focus is at the center of our vision of becoming the industry\u2019s first choice for innovative and application-critical flow control and compression equipment, services and solutions. We strive to collaborate with our customers and become an essential part of their engineering process by drawing on our deep industry and application engineering experience to develop best-in-class products that are critical to the processes and systems in which they operate. We have established strong and long-standing customer relationships with numerous industry leaders. We sell our products directly to end-use customers and to certain OEMs, and indirectly through independent distributors and sales representatives. We use a direct sales force to serve end-use customers and OEMs because these customers typically require higher levels of technical assistance, more coordinated shipment scheduling and more complex product service than customers that purchase through distributors. We have distribution centers and warehouses that stock parts, accessories and certain products to provide adequate and timely availability. In addition to our direct sales force, we are committed to developing and supporting our global network of over 1,000 distributors and representatives who provide a competitive advantage in the markets and industries we serve. These distributors maintain an inventory of complete units and parts and provide aftermarket services to end-users. While most distributors provide a broad range of products from different suppliers, we view our distributors as exclusive at the product category level (e.g. compressor, vacuum and blower). For example, a distributor may exclusively carry our compressor technologies, and also source additional components of the broader industrial system in which those products operate from other suppliers. Our service personnel and product engineers provide the distributors\u2019 service representatives with technical assistance and field training, particularly with respect to installation and repair of equipment. We also provide our distributors with sales and product literature, advertising and sales promotions, order-entry and tracking systems and an annual restocking program. Furthermore, we participate in major trade shows and directly market our offerings to generate sales leads and support the distributors\u2019 sales personnel. Our customer base is diverse, and we did not have any customers that individually provided more than 1% of 2022 consolidated revenues.  Patents, Tradenames, and Other Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. While in the aggregate our more than 1,700 patents and our tradenames are of considerable importance to the manufacture and marketing of many of our products, we believe that the success of our business depends more on the technical competence, creativity and marketing abilities of our employees than on any individual patent or tradename, and therefore we do not consider any single patent or tradename, group of patents or tradenames, copyright or trade secret to be material to our business as a whole, except for the\u00a0Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver\u00a0tradenames. We have registered our tradenames in the countries we deem necessary or in our best interest. We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and techniques, and we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees as well as our suppliers and other third parties receiving such information. Pursuant to tradename license agreements, Cooper Industries has exclusive rights to use the\u00a0Gardner Denver\u00a0tradename for certain power tools and their components, meaning that we are prevented from using this mark in connection with those products.  Raw Materials and Suppliers We purchase a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products. Our most significant commodity exposures are to cast iron, aluminum and steel. Additionally, we purchase a large number of motors and, therefore, are also exposed to changes  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents in the price of copper, which is a primary component of motors. Most of our raw materials are generally available from a number of suppliers. We have a limited number of long-term contracts with some suppliers of key components, but we believe that our sources of raw materials and components are reliable and adequate for our needs. In response to recent tightness in the supply chain and in order to improve continuity of supply, for select materials and components, we have expanded our supplier network in areas we have historically sole sourced. We continue to use single sources of supply for certain castings, motors and other select engineered components. A disruption in deliveries from a given supplier could therefore have an adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers. Nevertheless, we believe that we have appropriately balanced this risk against the cost of maintaining a greater number of suppliers. Moreover, we have sought, and will continue to seek, cost reductions in purchases of materials and supplies by consolidating purchases and pursuing alternate sources of supply.  Human Capital Management As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 17,000 employees of which approximately 5,000 are located in the United States. Of those employees located outside of the United States, a significant portion are represented by works councils and collective bargaining units; of those employees located in the United States, approximately 270 are represented by labor unions. We believe that our current relations with employees are satisfactory. We evaluate several metrics to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of our human capital management practices, including voluntary turnover and engagement. In 2022, our voluntary turnover was 13.0% and 10.2% for hourly and salaried employees, respectively. In 2021, our voluntary turnover was 11.6% and 8.8% for hourly and salaried employees, respectively. We believe the increase in our rates of voluntary turnover reflects broader economic trends and low unemployment rates and compares favorably to turnover rates experienced by similar organizations in our industry. We recently introduced a new performance management and development process, which places a heavy emphasis on manager engagement and employee ownership. We highlight employee development and engagement as a standard part of our employee experience. We have both a performance management process and a development planning process that are connected to reinforce the importance of continuous improvement over time. Our performance management and development planning process begins in January with setting aligned objectives and areas of development, and is then reviewed formally at mid-year and year-end. We track completion of each phase through our human resources system, to ensure that each employee discusses performance and professional development with the respective manager. We evaluate performance both in terms of what is accomplished (through metric achievement) and how it is accomplished (per our competencies), providing a more holistic view of effectiveness within the Company. Similarly, development plans are tied to descriptions and resources associated with our \u201cProfessional Contributor\u201d and \u201cPeople Leader\u201d competencies. We believe that all employees have the right to develop and that such employee development will differentiate us as a company in the marketplace. Our development process is employee led, supported by managers and company enabled. Health & Safety Our Environmental, Health, and Safety culture is focused on ensuring the health of our employees by eliminating risks of serious injuries, illness and fatalities through the application of rigorous standards, controls, inspections and audits to help ensure that our operations and premises comply with national and local regulations. In response to COVID-19, we implemented various measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers including work-from-home requirements (where practical), social distancing, contact tracing, enhanced hygiene education and deep-cleaning protocols at all of our facilities as well as travel restrictions, among other measures, complying with applicable governmental regulations and guidance. Competitive Pay, Benefits and Equity Our compensation and benefits philosophy is centered on two key fundamentals: (1) building long-term value for our stockholders, and (2) driving employee engagement and retention. We are committed to providing competitive pay, benefits, and equity that are valuable and meaningful to our employees. We provide a competitive total compensation package with a significant portion designed to foster a culture of ownership. We continue to offer our Ownership Works program to grant equity to all new and acquired employees regardless of level in the organization. It is our goal to foster an environment where employees can think and act like owners. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Ingersoll Rand\u2019s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (\u201cDE&I\u201d) commitment for our employees, partners and communities has been our focus over the past two years with a clear vision, measurable goals and specific levers to set the direction of our efforts: \u2022To be a DE&I leader within our industry that mirrors the communities and customers we serve. We will leverage diversity, equity and inclusion to exceed our business goals, attract and retain the best talent, and address today\u2019s global challenges. \u2022To connect to our value of fostering inspired teams, we cultivate diversity, promote equity and pursue a more inclusive culture that strengthens the sense of belonging for all. We expect individuals to uphold these aspirations with humility, integrity and respect. To solidify a successful execution of our strategy, we established a road map prioritizing initiatives through 2025 using our IRX process to build global accountability and timely execution. In terms of diverse representation, we have two focus areas: (1) underrepresented populations in the United States and (2) women globally. Our current employee base consists of 17.6% underrepresented populations in the U.S. with a 2025 target to increase to 30%. Globally, women represent 21.9% of our employees, moving towards our stated goal of 25% by 2025. We shifted from a centralized focus and embedded in the business a culture of ownership and accountability, setting specific business targets prioritizing representation among goals. Ingersoll Rand expanded to the following seven employee inclusion groups to build stronger global connections, advocate for positive change and foster an inclusive culture in the organization: \u2022Black Employee Network Inclusion Group \u2022Veterans Inclusion Group \u2022Women Inclusion Group \u2022Hispanic/LatinX Organization of Leadership and Advancement \u2022Asian Inclusion Group \u2022Pride Alliance \u2022IRealabilities - Disability Inclusion Group An executive leader sponsors each of the following groups and provides guidance to establish goals in support of our company strategies, culture and values to their global members. These groups act as strategic employee resources for talent management, community influence, employees experience, leadership development and mentoring. In addition, we also have four regional inclusion groups (Europe and Asia Pacific) and one DE&I council in Latin America. We deployed our unconscious bias training to more than 70% of our salaried employees and conducted personalized sessions to more than 150 leaders on \u201cDE&I Matters.\u201d We have launched our next phase to train hourly employees, adapting the content to \u201cRespect in the Workplace.\u201d To support our advancement goals, Ingersoll Rand launched a mentoring program in 2021, starting with a pilot of 100 mentors across the company and doubling to 200 additional mid-level and senior leaders in 2022. We continue creating a safe space for employees by participating in our \u201cLean into Change\u201d sessions where social and cultural sensitive conversations occur, fostering trust, transparency and community. Profiles in Diversity Journal recognized our \u201cLean into Change\u201d initiative by awarding us a Top 10 Innovations in Diversity Award. We recognize we play an important role in respecting and upholding human rights around the world. To illustrate our active commitment to, and respect of, human rights in our business relationships, we enforce our human rights policy to further embed and ensure responsibility for people throughout Ingersoll Rand. This policy helps us proactively and systematically identify potential human rights impacts to ensure prompt and fair remedial actions. Talent Development and Employee Engagement We are committed to continuously improving the development and engagement of all employees in the company. To support the development of our employees, we have several resources and programs to enable their continued growth and development. All of our offerings are grounded in our values and strategies which are reflected in our competencies. We continue to deliver an executive level program this past year called \u201cLead Like an Owner\u201d to set the standard of leadership and build succession at the top of the organization. In addition, there were several new manager programs deployed by region to ensure that those who are new to managing people have the skills and capabilities to succeed. We have online learning content that can be accessed around the globe for a variety of topics and have recently initiated several mentoring programs to allow our own internal  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents experts to teach and guide others. As mentioned above, our development planning process is tied to our performance management system which will ensure all employees have development conversations with their manager throughout the year.  Our employee engagement efforts have also produced substantive progress this year. Our last Connections/Engagement survey in October 2022 achieved a 88% participation rate, resulting in an engagement score of 81. While the overall market trended down with respect to employee engagement in 2022, we were able to make gains and maintain them throughout the year. All of our questions scored above the manufacturing benchmark collected by our engagement survey partner, with our key employee satisfaction measure scoring in the top 10% of manufacturing organizations. One aspect that is central to our engagement strategy is to make all employees true owners of the Company. To that end, we continue to ensure that all new or acquired employees, like our existing employees, are eligible to receive a restricted stock unit award after one year of employment. We feel that the combination of a solid strategy, strong values and clear expectations, coupled with true employee ownership, provides us strong engagement and a competitive edge. As a result of all of our Human Capital Management activities, we reflect our value of \u201cWe foster inspired teams.\u201d We nurture and celebrate a culture that embraces diverse points of views, backgrounds and experiences. We are committed to equity in how people are treated and the opportunities available to them because we know that a workplace that cultivates a sense of inclusion, belonging and respect will develop the most talented and capable employees.  Environmental Matters We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission and disposal of materials and discharge of materials into the environment. We believe our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area. We have an environmental policy that confirms our commitment to a clean environment and compliance with environmental laws. We have an active environmental management program aimed at complying with existing environmental regulations and reducing the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes. We are also subject to laws concerning the cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes, such as the U.S. federal \u201cSuperfund\u201d and similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under the \u201cSuperfund\u201d or similar state laws. See \u201cItem 3.
