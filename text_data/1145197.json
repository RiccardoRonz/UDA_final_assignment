{"cik": 1145197, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business Overview  Insulet Corporation (\u201cwe\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is primarily engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of its proprietary Omnipod\u00ae System, a continuous insulin delivery system for people with insulin-dependent diabetes, which we have been selling since 2005. The Omnipod System includes: the Omnipod Insulin Management System (\u201cClassic Omnipod\u201d), the Omnipod DASH\u00ae Insulin Management System (\u201cOmnipod DASH\u201d), and the Omnipod\u00ae 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System (\u201cOmnipod 5\u201d). In addition, substantially all of our Drug Delivery revenue consists of sales of pods to Amgen for use in the Neulasta\u00ae Onpro\u00ae kit, a delivery system for Amgen\u2019s Neulasta to help reduce the risk of infection after intense chemotherapy. Market Opportunity: Management of Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. It is caused by the body\u2019s inability to produce or effectively utilize the hormone insulin, which prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels. Glucose, the primary source of energy for cells, must be maintained at certain concentrations in the blood in order to permit optimal cell function and health. In people with diabetes, blood glucose levels fluctuate between very high levels, a condition known as hyperglycemia, and very low levels, a condition called hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia can lead to serious short-term complications, such as confusion, vomiting, dehydration, and loss of consciousness and long-term complications, such as blindness, kidney disease, nervous system disease, occlusive vascular diseases, stroke, cardiovascular disease, or death. Hypoglycemia can lead to confusion, loss of consciousness, or death. Diabetes is typically classified as either type 1 or type 2: \u2022Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body\u2019s nearly complete inability to produce insulin. It is frequently diagnosed during childhood or adolescence. Individuals with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin therapy to survive. We estimate that approximately five million people have type 1 diabetes in the countries we currently serve. \u2022Type 2 diabetes, the more common form, is characterized by the body\u2019s inability to either properly utilize insulin or produce enough insulin. Historically, type 2 diabetes has occurred in later adulthood, but its incidence is increasing among the younger population, due primarily to increasing obesity. Initially, many people with type 2 diabetes attempt to manage their diabetes with improvements in diet, exercise, and/or oral medications. As their diabetes advances, some individuals progress to multiple drug therapies, which often include insulin therapy. We estimate that approximately six million people have insulin-intensive type 2 diabetes in the countries we currently serve. We estimate that approximately 40% of the type 1 diabetes population in the United States and even less of the international type 1 diabetes population use insulin pump therapy. An even smaller portion of the U.S. and international insulin-intensive type 2 diabetes population use insulin pump therapy. We believe these factors present a significant available market for the Omnipod System globally. Throughout this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K, we refer to both type 1 diabetes and insulin-intensive type 2 diabetes as insulin-dependent diabetes. Diabetes Management Challenges Diabetes is often frustrating and difficult for people to manage. Blood glucose levels can be affected by the carbohydrate and fat content of meals, exercise, stress, illness, impending illness, hormonal releases, variability in insulin absorption, and changes in the effects of insulin on the body. For people with insulin-dependent diabetes, many corrections, consisting of the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates, are needed throughout the day in order to maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges. Achieving this result can be very difficult with multiple daily injections of insulin. Individuals with diabetes attempting to control their blood glucose levels tightly to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels are at greater risk for overcorrection and hypoglycemia. As a result, many people have difficulty managing their diabetes. Additionally, the time spent managing fluctuations in blood glucose levels and the fear associated with hypoglycemia can be incredibly stressful for individuals with diabetes and their families. Current Insulin Therapy People with insulin-dependent diabetes need a continuous supply of insulin, known as basal insulin, to provide for background metabolic needs. In addition to basal insulin, people with insulin-dependent diabetes require supplemental insulin, known as bolus insulin, to compensate for carbohydrates ingested during meals or snacks or for a high blood glucose level caused by other physiological reasons. There are two primary types of insulin therapy practiced today: multiple daily injections (\u201cMDI\u201d) therapy using syringes or insulin pens and pump therapy using insulin pumps. 3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents MDI therapy involves the administration of fast-acting insulin before meals (bolus) to lower blood glucose levels to a healthy range. MDI therapy may also require a separate injection of a long-acting (basal) insulin, to control glucose levels between meals; typically, once or twice per day. By comparison, insulin pump therapy uses only fast-acting insulin to fulfill both mealtime (bolus) and background (basal) requirements. Insulin pump therapy allows individuals to customize their bolus and basal insulin doses to meet their insulin needs throughout the day and is intended to more closely resemble the physiologic function of a healthy pancreas. Insulin pumps perform continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and typically use a programmable device and an infusion set to administer insulin into the body. Insulin pump therapy has been shown to provide numerous advantages relative to MDI therapy. For example, insulin pump therapy eliminates individual insulin injections, delivers insulin more accurately and precisely than injections, often improves HbA1c (a common measure of blood glucose levels) over time, provides greater flexibility with meals, exercise, and daily schedules, and can reduce severe low blood glucose levels. We believe that these advantages, along with technological advancements, including the use of continuous glucose monitoring technology and automated insulin device (\u201cAID\u201d) algorithms, and increased awareness of insulin pump therapy\u00a0will continue to generate demand for insulin pump devices.  Our Solution: The Omnipod System The Omnipod System is a continuous insulin delivery system that provides all the benefits of insulin pump therapy in a unique way. We believe the Omnipod System\u2019s innovative proprietary design and differentiated features allow people with insulin-dependent diabetes to live their lives and manage their diabetes, with unprecedented freedom, comfort, convenience, and ease. Omnipod DASHOmnipod 5    The Omnipod System features two discreet and easy-to-use devices that eliminates the need for the external tubing required with conventional pumps: \u2022a small, lightweight, self-adhesive disposable tubeless Omnipod device (\u201cPod\u201d) that the user fills with insulin and wears directly on the body. It can be worn in multiple locations, including the abdomen, hip, back of upper arm, upper thigh, or lower back. The Pod delivers insulin into the body through a small flexible tube (called a cannula); and \u2022the Personal Diabetes Manager (\u201cPDM\u201d) or Controller, a wireless, handheld device that programs the Pod with the user\u2019s personalized insulin-delivery instructions and wirelessly monitors the Pod\u2019s operation.  Additionally, Omnipod 5 is interoperable with a third-party continuous glucose monitor (\u201cCGM\u201d) sold separately that obtains glucose values and integrates with the Pod. Further, we have partnered with Glooko Inc. (\u201cGlooko\u201d) to connect our Omnipod System user data with Glooko\u2019s comprehensive diabetes data management system (including Glooko and Diasend in selected regions). Glooko provides a cloud-based application for clinicians and users accessible through a kiosk, home computer, or a mobile application on the user\u2019s smartphone that provides users and their healthcare providers access to insulin delivery trends, blood glucose levels, and other integrated data.  Omnipod DASH Omnipod DASH was fully launched in the United States in 2019 and in our international markets starting in 2020. It features a secure Bluetooth enabled Pod and PDM with a color touch screen user interface supported by smartphone connectivity. In the U.S., the PDM has nightly automatic data uploads providing users and their clinicians with cloud access to data, and enhancements for pushing software updates wirelessly to users. 4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents Omnipod DASH provides continuous insulin delivery at preset rates, eliminating the need for individual insulin injections. In addition, insulin delivery can be changed with the press of a button to adapt to snacks or unexpected changes in daily routine. Omnipod DASH delivers insulin in two ways: \u2022A small, constant background supply of insulin is delivered automatically at a programmed rate, all day and night. \u2022An extra dose of insulin can be delivered when needed to match the carbohydrates in a snack or meal to correct high blood glucose. We have designed Omnipod DASH to fit within the normal daily routines of users. Omnipod DASH communicates wirelessly, provides for virtually pain-free automated cannula insertion, and eliminates the need for MDI therapy or the use of pump and tubing. The Pod can be worn for up to three days at a time and, because it is waterproof up to 25 feet, there is no need to remove it when showering, swimming, or performing other activities. As a result, Omnipod DASH is easy to use, which reduces the training burden on healthcare professionals and users. We believe that Omnipod DASH\u2019s overall ease of use and flexibility make it very attractive to people with insulin-dependent diabetes and their healthcare professionals. Omnipod 5 Omnipod 5, which builds on our Omnipod DASH platform, was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) in January 2022. Our limited market release of Omnipod 5 in the United States commenced the following month, and in August 2022 we launched our U.S. full market release. In September 2022, we received CE Mark approval for Omnipod 5 under the European Union Medical Device Regulation (\u201cMDR\u201d).  Omnipod 5 includes an AID algorithm that is located on the Pod. The Pod integrates with a third-party CGM to obtain glucose values trough wireless Bluetooth communication. The embedded algorithm predicts glucose levels into the future and automatically adjusts insulin dosing intended to achieve user selected glucose targets and reduce the occurrence of blood glucose highs and lows. The user can also deliver insulin doses for snacks or meals or to correct high blood glucose through the system. The Pod is controllable by an Insulet-provided handheld device (Controller) or a user-downloaded Android app, which allows for full compatible smartphone control. The Omnipod 5 Controller and Omnipod 5 Android app use cloud-based technology to wirelessly upload data using a built-in SIM card for cellular connectivity or from a secure Wi-Fi connection if established. The Pod currently integrates with a CGM manufactured by Dexcom, Inc. Subsequent to the launch of Omnipod 5, the vast majority of our customer base is no longer using our Classic Omnipod product. We plan to phase-out our Classic Omnipod product in the U.S. in 2023. Security Paramount to our ability to deliver full compatible smartphone control is our commitment to cybersecurity and information security. Omnipod DASH is the first FDA-cleared insulin pump certified under the Diabetes Technology Society\u2019s \u201cStandard for Wireless Diabetes Device Security\u201d cybersecurity assurance standard and program, known as DTSec. This certification is a cybersecurity standard intended to raise confidence in the security of network connected medical devices through independent expert evaluation. In addition, Insulet\u2019s information security management system is International Organization for Standardization (\u201cISO\u201d) 27001 and 27701 certified, which are the international standard for best practice in an information security management system globally. With the DTSec and ISO certifications, Insulet is globally recognized for incorporating the highest standards for cybersecurity and information security and safety, including secure data transfer between the Pod and PDM, as well as secure cloud storage. Insulet continues to advance the cybersecurity capabilities of our medical devices. Omnipod 5 is globally recognized for incorporating the highest standards for information and cyber security by design, which includes secure data transfer between the Pod and the Controller, as well as secure cloud storage. Omnipod 5 is certified by ISO 27001 and the U.K. Cyber Essentials. In addition, Omnipod 5 utilizes state-of-the-art authentication, encryption, and cybersecurity protection that enables the use of approved personal smartphone devices. Third-Party Reimbursement In the United States, our products are sold to wholesalers, private healthcare organizations, healthcare facilities, mail order pharmacies, and independent retailers, as well as directly to consumers. These entities, and the Company in some cases, seek reimbursement from health insurance companies and/or government administrative payors. In the United States, consumers generally have commercial insurance, Medicare or Medicaid coverage that pays for the product. The Omnipod System\u2019s unique patented design allows us to provide pump therapy at a relatively low or no up-front investment, which reduces the risk to third-party payors in the U.S. In certain international locations in which we sell through a distributor or intermediary, our distribution partners and local intermediaries establish appropriate reimbursement contracts with healthcare systems in those countries and provinces. 5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Markets and Distribution Methods The Omnipod System is currently available in the following 24 countries:  AustraliaFinlandItalySwedenAustriaFranceKuwaitSwitzerlandBelgiumGermanyNetherlandsTurkeyCanadaGreeceNorwayUnited Arab EmiratesCroatiaIcelandQatarUnited KingdomDenmarkIsraelSaudi ArabiaUnited States We sell the Omnipod System directly to consumers, through distribution partners and in the U.S. also through the pharmacy channel. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 84% of our Omnipod System sales were through intermediaries. The Omnipod System is also marketed to physicians. The percentages of total revenue for customers that represent 10% or more of total revenue was as follows:  Years Ended December 31,202220212020Distributor A19%**Distributor B17%12%10%Distributor C*10%11%Distributor D16%**   * Represents less than 10% of revenue for the period. Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on customer acquisition and retention to meet the user, clinician, and payor demands for the Omnipod System. We have a comprehensive sales and marketing approach, which communicates the benefits of the Omnipod System to users, physicians and providers. This includes three areas of focus: \u2022Building consumer awareness about the features and benefits that the Omnipod System provides to simplify diabetes management. \u2022Strengthening physician support by demonstrating clinical evidence of how the Omnipod System improves outcomes and quality of life and providing data and insights to physicians offering diabetes care.  \u2022Providing payors with the clinical and economic justifications for why the Omnipod System offers unique value to the people whom they insure.  Training We believe that training consumers on how to use the Omnipod System is an important factor to promote successful outcomes and customer retention. We have streamlined and standardized our training by developing improved online resources and increased our field clinician team to directly train new Omnipod System users. We created an online training program for Omnipod customers transitioning to Omnipod DASH or Omnipod 5. In addition, our virtual training allows us to onboard new Omnipod customers transitioning from MDI in a cost-effective manner. Our distributors and intermediaries have also implemented virtual training programs.  Customer Support We seek to provide our customers with high quality customer support, from product ordering to insurance investigation, order fulfillment and ongoing support. Our customer support systems are integrated with our sales, reimbursement and billing processes, allowing us to provide customers with seamless and reliable support by telephone and through our website. Competition The diabetes medical device market is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. The Omnipod System competes for consumers in the insulin delivery market. Because most new Omnipod System users come from MDI therapy, which currently is the most prevalent method of insulin delivery, we believe that we primarily compete with companies that provide products and supplies for MDI therapy. We also compete with companies in the insulin pump market, which today consists of tubed pump companies, including Medtronic MiniMed, a division of Medtronic public limited company (\u201cMedtronic\u201d), and Tandem Diabetes Care Inc. (\u201cTandem\u201d). Medtronic historically has held the  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents majority share of the tubed insulin pump market. The competitive landscape in our industry continues to undergo significant change. In addition to the established insulin pump competitors, several companies are working to develop and market new insulin pumps and smart pens. These companies are at various stages of development and the number of such companies often changes as they enter or exit the market. Our non-insulin Drug Delivery product line competes with drug delivery device companies such as West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. Research and Development Our innovation programs are designed to drive: \u2022simplicity of user interaction with our systems; \u2022improved outcomes through algorithm advancements; \u2022insights and value from our growing datasets and analytics; and \u2022user choice of sensor and smartphone integrations. In addition, our research and development efforts are primarily focused on making improvements to the Omnipod System, including adding features and functionality that will deliver increased economic value and convenience to users. In 2022, we received FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 for individuals aged two years and older with type 1 diabetes and received CE Mark approval for Omnipod 5 under the European Union MDR. We plan to begin a pivotal trial for Omnipod 5 in 2023 with the goal of expanding Omnipod 5\u2019s indications to individuals with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we have a development and commercialization agreement to integrate Abbott Diabetes Care, Inc.\u2019s CGM with Omnipod 5 in the future and are also working on developing an iOS app that could be utilized to control Omnipod 5 Pods. Additionally, in November 2022, we submitted our 510(k) application to the FDA for a basal-only Pod for individuals with type 2 diabetes, which is a version of Omnipod specifically designed for customers on basal-only therapy. The basal-only Pod is designed to deliver a fixed rate of rapid-acting insulin for 72 continuous hours and does not require a PDM/Controller or phone application for use. Manufacturing and Quality Assurance  We believe a key contributing factor to the overall attractiveness and success of the Omnipod System is the disposable nature of the Pod. In order to manufacture sufficient volumes at high quality and achieve a cost-effective per unit production price for the Omnipod, we have designed the Omnipod System to be manufactured through automation. In 2019, we began producing product at our highly automated manufacturing facility in Acton, Massachusetts and in 2020 and 2021, we began producing on additional lines in this facility. The Acton facility increases supply redundancy and adds capacity closer to our North American customer base to support the growth of our business. We also produce our devices on manufacturing lines at a facility in Kunshan (Shanghai), China operated by a contract manufacturer. This contract manufacturing agreement expires in October 2025 and is subject to automatic renewal, unless canceled by either party under the terms of the contract. We have optimized our operations in China by consolidating our Omnipod production in that region into this one location. Additionally, in 2022, we broke ground on a new manufacturing plant in Malaysia to support our international expansion strategy and further ensure product supply. We also continue to invest in supply chain efficiencies, including automation improvements at our suppliers and contract manufacturer. In January 2022, we acquired one of our suppliers to bring key intellectual property and expertise in-house, strengthen our production capabilities and mitigate supply chain risks.  Raw Materials We use a broad range of raw materials in the assembly and manufacturing of the Omnipod System. We purchase our raw materials and select components used in the manufacturing of our products from external suppliers. We purchase some supplies from a single or limited number of sources for reasons of proprietary know-how, quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for a certain number of the components and sub-assemblies used in the manufacture of the Omnipod System, including application-specific integrated circuit chips, Bluetooth low-energy chips, and other specialized parts.\u00a0The design of certain components and sub-assemblies (including, in some instances, the raw materials used to manufacture them) is proprietary and the intellectual property rights may be owned exclusively by one party.\u00a0In such cases, we are sole sourced with the supplier controlling the intellectual property rights. These sole sourced components are critical to the design and functionality of the Omnipod System. In the case of sole sourced parts, we manage risk through holding inventory in-house and at the supplier to ensure continuity of supply and lower risk of disruption.\u00a0We purchase many of our components and sub-assemblies from manufacturers with whom we are at  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents least dual sourced. We work closely with all suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Quality Assurance We utilize outside vendors for the supply of components, sub-assemblies, and various services used in the manufacture of the Omnipod System. Our outside vendors produce the components to our specifications, and they are audited periodically by our Quality Assurance Department to confirm conformity with the specifications, policies, and procedures for the Omnipod System. Our Quality Assurance Department also inspects and tests the Omnipod System at various steps in the manufacturing cycle to facilitate compliance with our specifications. We have received our ISO, European Union MDR, and Medical Device Single Audit Program certifications for our Quality Management System from BSI Group, an accredited Notified Body for CE Marking. Processes utilized in the manufacture, test, and release of the Omnipod System have been verified and validated as required by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. As a medical device manufacturer and distributor, our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of our suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, certain corresponding state agencies, and other regulatory bodies. Intellectual Property To maintain a competitive advantage, we believe we must develop and preserve the proprietary aspect of our technologies. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements, and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. We require our employees, consultants, and advisers to execute non-disclosure agreements in connection with their employment, consulting, or advisory relationships with us, where appropriate. We also require employees, consultants, and advisers who work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during their work with us that are developed using our property or relate to our business. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the Omnipod System or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Patents As of December 31, 2022, we had over 260 patents in the United States and in certain other countries, with expiration dates ranging from 2023 through 2042 and had over 250 patent applications pending. The issued patents and pending patent applications cover, among other things: \u2022the basic architecture of the Omnipod System, including the pump and the PDM/Controller; \u2022the Omnipod drive system; \u2022the Omnipod cannula insertion system;\u00a0 \u2022control features of the Omnipod System and next generation products; \u2022software, such as algorithms and apps, for controlling the Omnipod System and next generation products; and \u2022various novel aspects of the Omnipod System, potential future generations of Omnipod Systems, and other mechanisms for the delivery of pharmaceuticals. Trademarks\u00a0 We have registered various trademarks associated with our business with the United\u00a0States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register and in other appropriate jurisdictions. Our trademarks include INSULETTM, OMNIPOD\u00ae, OMNIPOD\u00ae 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System, SIMPLIFY LIFETM, Omnipod DASH\u00ae, Omnipod DISPLAY\u00ae, Omnipod VIEWTM, SmartAdjustTM, Pod Pals\u00ae, Podder\u00ae, and PodderCentral\u00ae. Recent Intellectual Property Agreements  Bigfoot.  In February 2023, we entered into a Patent Assignment and License Agreement with Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. (\u201cBigfoot\u201d), pursuant to which we acquired approximately 400 patents as well as a significant number of global patent applications, and licensed a large number of additional patents and patent applications on a fully paid-up exclusive or non-exclusive basis. Medtronic.  In October 2022, we entered into a mutual agreement with Medtronic, Inc., not to assert our patents against each other for certain technologies in the field of diabetes. With certain exclusions, this agreement applies to the companies\u2019 existing products, as well as new products for at least the next seven years. No payments have been or will be exchanged as part of the agreement. The agreement replaces and terminates the Settlement and Cross License Agreement, dated September 18, 2013, by and between us and Medtronic. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Government Regulation United States FDA Regulation The Omnipod System is a medical device subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance or approval, manufacturing, labeling, product storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, post-market adverse event reporting, post-market surveillance, complaint handling, repair or recall of products, and record keeping. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either prior 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) from the FDA. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive and lengthy and entail significant user fees. We have obtained 510(k) clearance for the Omnipod, Omnipod DASH, and Omnipod 5 Systems and expect that regulatory approval will be needed for some of our future products. In addition, we may be required to obtain a new 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval for significant post-market modifications to our products.  510(k) Clearance.  To obtain 510(k) clearance for any of our potential future devices (or for certain modifications to devices that have previously received 510(k) clearance), we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance pathway generally takes three to 12 months from the date the application is completed but can take significantly longer. A 510(k) application must be supported by extensive data, including technical information, labeling, and potentially clinical data to meet any Special Controls and to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction. After a medical device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a significant change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but if the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer\u2019s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained and assess significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite 510(k) or PMA application(s). PMA.  Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device generally require a PMA before they can be commercially distributed. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including technical information, pre-clinical and clinical trials, manufacturing information and labeling, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction. After a PMA application is complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA conducts a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d), which impose elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from people in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. After PMA, a new PMA application or application supplement may be required in the event of modifications to the device, its labeling, intended use or indication, or its manufacturing process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Clinical Trials.  Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and may also be required to support 510(k) submissions. If the device presents a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to human health as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an investigational device exemption (\u201cIDE\u201d) and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once an IDE is approved by the FDA and the appropriate Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) at each clinical trial site. If the product is deemed a \u201cnon-significant risk\u201d device, IDE approval from the FDA would not be required, but the clinical trial would need to meet other requirements including IRB approval.  Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and federal and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including informed consent and healthcare privacy. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA or at a  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents specific site by the relevant IRB at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the trial participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the clinical trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results of our clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may be equivocal or otherwise insufficient for us to obtain approval of our product. Ongoing Regulation.\u00a0\u00a0After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including: \u2022establishment registration and device listing; \u2022QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during the development and manufacturing process; \u2022labeling regulations and prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities; \u2022medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; \u2022corrections and product recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health. In addition, the FDA may order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;\u00a0and \u2022post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions: untitled letters or warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusal of or delay in granting 510(k) clearance or PMA of new products or modified products, rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances or withdrawing previously granted PMAs, or refusal to grant import or export approval of our products. We are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories, or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations. Since approval of the Omnipod System, we have been subject to FDA inspections of our facilities on multiple occasions. Other Regulations Licensure.\u00a0Several states require that durable medical equipment (\u201cDME\u201d) providers be licensed in order to sell products in that state. Certain of these states require, among other things, that DME providers maintain an in-state location. In order to sell our product through the pharmacy channel in the United States, we are required to work with intermediaries who have the appropriate pharmacy license for the applicable market.  In addition, we are subject to certain state laws regarding professional licensure. We believe that our certified diabetes educators are in compliance with all such state laws. However, if our educators or we were to be found non-compliant, we may need to modify our approach to providing education, clinical support, and customer service. Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws.\u00a0 The federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration (anything of value) in return for, or to induce: \u2022the referral of an individual; \u2022furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs;\u00a0or \u2022the purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of, any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between drug and medical device manufacturers and suppliers on one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Liability  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents under the statute may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, claims resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitute false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act discussed below. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common business practices from prosecution and administrative sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that may be perceived as inducing the prescription, purchase, or recommendation of the Omnipod System may be subject to scrutiny under the law. For example, we provide the initial training to users necessary for appropriate use of the Omnipod System either through our own diabetes educators or by contracting with outside diabetes educators that have completed a Certified Pod Trainer course. We compensate outside diabetes educators for their services at contracted rates deemed to be consistent with the market. We have structured our arrangements with diabetes educators and other business practices to comply with statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices may be subject to scrutiny if they fail to strictly comply with the criteria in the exemption or regulatory safe harbor. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices such as providing reimbursement assistance, coding and billing information, or other customer assistance and product support programs. If any of our practices, arrangements, or programs are found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, we could be subject to significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, including imprisonment, fines, damages, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental programs. Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the furnishing of certain \u201cdesignated health services,\u201d including durable medical equipment, in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received for items and services referred by a physician with a noncompliant arrangement, civil damages and penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental programs. Although there are statutory and regulatory exceptions protecting certain common business practices, and we have structured our arrangements with physicians and other providers to comply with these exceptions, these arrangements may not expressly meet the requirements for applicable exceptions from the Stark Law.  Federal Civil False Claims Act.\u00a0 The federal civil False Claims Act imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act are subject to the imposition of significant per claim penalties, three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid. We believe that we are in compliance with the federal government\u2019s laws and regulations concerning the filing of claims for reimbursement. However, many drug and medical device manufacturers have been investigated or subject to lawsuits by whistleblowers and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; or causing submission of false claims by providing inaccurate coding or billing information to actual or prospective purchasers. Our business practices could be subject to scrutiny and enforcement under the federal False Claims Act. We also may be subject to other federal false claim laws, including federal criminal statutes that prohibit making a false statement to the federal government. Civil Monetary Penalties Law.\u00a0\u00a0We are subject to the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in significant civil monetary penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service, and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.  Federal Healthcare Fraud Statutes.  We are also subject to a federal healthcare fraud statutes that, among other things, impose criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including non-governmental programs, and prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document with knowledge that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Violations of these statutes can result in significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, fines, damages, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. State Fraud and Abuse Laws and Marketing Restrictions.\u00a0 Many states have adopted anti-kickback, anti-referral laws, and false claims laws and regulations analogous to the federal civil Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act.  In some cases, these state laws apply regardless of the payor, including private payors. We believe that we are in compliance with such laws.  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents Moreover, several states have imposed requirements to disclose payments to healthcare providers, restrictions on marketing and other expenditures, and requirements to adopt a code of conduct or compliance program with specific elements. Liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. Administrative Simplification of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\u00a0\u00a0The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) mandated the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare industry. Ensuring privacy and security of patient information is one of the key factors driving the legislation. HIPAA regulations have been amended under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009. If we are found to be in violation of HIPAA, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Privacy Laws.  Several states have enacted various privacy laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) is a consumer privacy law, which provides certain privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of the state of California. These consumer rights include the right to know what personal information is collected, the right to know whether the data is sold or disclosed and to whom, the right to request a company to the delete personal information collected, the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information and the right to non-discrimination in terms of price or service when a consumer exercises a privacy right. The California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) amends and expands the CCPA with respect to personal data collected beginning in January 2022. CPRA enforcement is scheduled to begin on July 1, 2023. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be subject to civil sanctions, including fines and penalties for noncompliance. Virginia and Colorado have enacted similar laws. The Consumer Data Protection Act became effective in Virginia on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act is effective July 1, 2023. In addition, general privacy legislation has been filed in Congress, but the final form of the legislation and when it might be enacted is difficult to predict. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\u00a0\u00a0The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (\u201cACA\u201d) enacted significant changes to the provision of and payment for healthcare in the United States. Under the ACA and related laws and regulations, federal and state government initiatives are focused on limiting the growth of healthcare costs and implementing changes to healthcare delivery structures. These reforms are intended in part to put increased emphasis on the delivery to patients of more cost-effective therapies and could adversely affect our business. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible. While some uncertainty exists regarding the future aspects of the ACA, we expect that the ACA will continue to have a significant impact on the delivery of healthcare in the United States and on our business in the near term. Physician Payments Sunshine Act.\u00a0\u00a0The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, requires manufacturers of drugs and devices for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physician and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are also required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives. Failure to disclose reportable payments could subject us to penalties and materially adversely impact our business and financial results. Certain states\u2019 laws require additional reporting of payments and transfers of value to healthcare providers. Since these laws and regulations continue to evolve, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws and regulations as they relate to certain of our arrangements and programs, including those with providers with respect to user training. We cannot predict the final form of these regulations or the effect their application will have on us. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found not to be in compliance with applicable laws.  Ensuring that our business arrangements and interactions with healthcare professionals, third\u2011party payors, customers and others comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations requires substantial resources. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the exceptions or safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.   U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d).  We are subject to FCPA in the U.S. and to similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, our customer relationships outside of the United States may be with governmental entities and therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents International Regulations International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.  The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, clinical trials, manufacture, labeling, and adverse event reporting for medical devices, including the Medical Device Directive (\u201cMDD\u201d) and the Medical Device Regulation (\u201cMDR\u201d), which replaced MDD in May 2021. Devices that comply with the requirements of the MDD will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed until May 2024, at which time devices must comply with the MDR, unless certain requirements are met that would allow for an extension until December 2027. The method of assessing conformity with the applicable directive varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a \u201cNotified Body\u201d. The latter is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer\u2019s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer\u2019s product. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis for us to market our products. We have obtained the right to affix the CE Mark to the Omnipod and Omnipod DASH Systems under the MDD and to the Omnipod 5 System under MDR, which allows us to distribute these products throughout the European Union and in other countries that recognize the CE Mark. In addition, we have Health Canada approval to sell Classic Omnipod and Omnipod DASH in Canada. A range of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, as well as industry specific laws and codes of conduct, apply to the medical device industry and interactions with government officials and entities and healthcare professionals. These laws include the U.K. Bribery Act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate. Such laws generally prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business to foreign officials, or in the case of the U.K. Bribery Act, to any person. General Data Protection Regulation.  The General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) is a comprehensive update to the data protection regime in the European Economic Area that imposes requirements relating to, among other things, consent to process personal data of individuals, the information provided to individuals regarding the processing of their personal data, the security and confidentiality of personal data, notifications in the event of data breaches, and use of third-party processors. If we fail to comply with these standards, we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and penalties for noncompliance. Human Capital Resources Employees Our people are our most valuable asset and are the source of our innovation and our success. We strive to attract and retain the best talent with competitive compensation and benefits, opportunities for growth and development, and a culture that emphasizes fair and equitable treatment. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,600\u00a0full-time employees, representing a 13% increase over the prior year. Approximately 80% of our employees are located in the United States and the remainder are located in 15 other countries.  To assess and improve employee retention and engagement, we survey employees with the assistance of third-party consultants, and take timely action to address key areas of employee concern. We conduct engagement surveys to gain valuable insight into our employees\u2019 experience and identify areas for improvement. In 2022, instead of conducting an engagement survey once per year, we launched \u2018Your Voice\u2019 pulse surveys, which are conducted more often, to better understand opportunities to improve our talent management strategy and gain a more dynamic view of our employees\u2019 needs. Our senior leadership team assesses engagement to understand and identify potential opportunities for improvement.  Our executive leadership team conducts regular Town Hall meetings to ensure our global employees are highly engaged and receive timely business updates. To help our remote employees feel socially connected to their colleagues, we created our \u201cStay Connected\u201d initiative, which includes virtual meetings with our executive team members. These virtual meetings are designed as casual conversations with our executives so employees can talk about what is on their minds, get to know the executive leaders, and connect with colleagues from across the organization. We also publish a monthly global employee newsletter, which includes a timely collection of high-level developments and local highlights from across our organization and utilize a social networking tool to ensure our global employees are engaged, motivated, and collaborating with one another.  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) Our success thrives on the diversity of perspective, thought, experience, and background within our workforce. We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive global culture that reflects the diversity of the customers we serve and creates an environment where all employees feel welcomed, respected, and valued. Accordingly, we are committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of our Company culture and workplace. In 2022, we continued to develop a comprehensive, multi-year diversity and social impact strategy that outlines how to implement our greatest opportunities for impact, in alignment with the needs of our stakeholders and diversity maturity model. Our DEI activities focus on four main areas\u2014Attraction, Talent Development, Culture, and External Engagement\u2014which reflect our commitment to integrating DEI within our business processes. In 2022, we worked to embed diversity more formally into our talent acquisition process to attract a diverse pool of candidates. In addition, we launched our flagship diversity training, Conscious Inclusion, to all employees. Our Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) serve as a source of inclusion across the following eight categories: African Descent, Asian and Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latin, LGBTQ+, Sustainability, Veterans and First Responders, Women, and Young Professionals. These ERGs support the acquisition of diverse talent and are sponsored by senior leaders across our organization. Training and Development We are committed to fostering an environment in which our employees continuously learn and develop. We offer both leadership and professional skills development programs. All employees who join Insulet undergo a robust onboarding program called RITE Start that introduces our core values of respect, integrity, teamwork, and excellence, and educates new employees about diabetes, our Omnipod products, our business strategy, our culture, and our mission, which is to improve the lives of people with diabetes. In 2022, we launched our \u2018Ignite Your Growth\u2019 career development program to employees across the globe. We also offer intensive Customer Care New Hire Training and Sales New Hire Training. In addition, employees have access to monthly learning programs and virtual and online learning programs. Further, during our 2022 annual Compliance Week, employees logged over 7,000 training hours. We offer leadership development programs to support the growth of our future leaders. We also offer training for new managers and resources for our experienced leaders. Additionally, we offer professional certification course reimbursement of up to $3,000 annually and tuition reimbursement of up to $5,250 annually for courses taken in pursuit of an undergraduate degree and up to $10,000 annually for courses taken in pursuit of a graduate degree. Finally, we offer virtual training programs and employee communications designed to support employees and leaders that take advantage of our flexible work policy, including programs on leading effective remote meetings, managing remotely, and how to leverage collaborative learning tools.  Competitive Pay and Benefits Our compensation program is designed to align employee compensation with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation program balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically, \u2022We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location. \u2022We engage internationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking. \u2022We align our executives\u2019 long-term equity compensation with our shareholders\u2019 interests. \u2022Annual increases and incentive compensation are based on our performance as well as each individual\u2019s contribution to the results achieved and are documented through our talent management process as part of our annual review process. We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options that allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Our wide-ranging benefits include health insurance, telehealth, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, 80 hours of COVID-19 paid sick time, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible savings accounts, retirement plans, employee stock purchase plan, legal services, identity theft protection, maternity/paternity leave, and employee assistance program. In addition, we offer Pod perks, which provides a free Omnipod System, including PDM/Controller and Pods to benefit eligible employees, interns, or dependents; summer hours; and a flexible work policy. In additional to the above, we continued our commitment to flexibility through our Future of Work program. Our Future of Work program and Global Flexible Working Arrangement Policy are rooted in a \u201cchoice with responsibility\u201d philosophy. Our sustained commitment to flexibility enables access to a broader, more diverse, and more exceptional talent pool. 14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents Health and Safety We maintain an occupational health and safety management system that covers all our employees, contractors, and temporary employees because we are committed to the safety and well-being of our workforce. By minimizing risks at our factories and implementing training to enhance awareness of hazards, we are able to promote safe practices and preserve the health of our employees. Modern manufacturing enables efficiency and automation, which reduces exposure to health and safety risks throughout the production process. At our facilities, the majority of our equipment is fully automated to minimize human involvement in the operations of machines and therefore reduce the risk of injury. We maintain high standards for workplace safety, and our orientation for technicians includes training about safe procedures, such as lockout/tagout.  We have a Health and Safety Compliance Manual to provide employees with the tools needed to identify and report hazards and reduce work-related injuries. Our programs and policies are in compliance with applicable local, regional, and federal laws, including U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements. We continuously monitor and adapt to regional regulations as we expand our facilities into new geographies. In addition to hazard recognition, our workplace health and safety programs cover ergonomics, hearing conservation, fall protection, and accident and injury prevention.  We also have formal plans in place to protect our employee\u2019s safety in the event of an emergency. In addition, our Acton, Massachusetts facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan that describes procedures that employees should follow when faced with a variety of unexpected health and safety events. As part of this initiative, we trained certain employees to use automated external defibrillators, provide first aid, and perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In addition, we conduct periodic health and safety audits of our facilities to monitor the effectiveness of our programs and drive continuous improvement in our overall safety performance as Insulet expands in size and impact.
