BUSINESS General Danaher is a global science and technology innovator committed to helping customers solve complex challenges and improving quality of life around the world.  Danaher is comprised of more than 20 operating companies with leadership positions in the biotechnology, life sciences, diagnostics, environmental and applied sectors, organized under four segments (Biotechnology; Life Sciences; Diagnostics; and Environmental & Applied Solutions).  United by the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (\u201cDBS\u201d), our businesses are also typically characterized by a high level of products and services that are sold on a recurring basis, primarily through a direct sales model and to a geographically diverse customer base.  Our business\u2019 research and development, manufacturing, sales, distribution, service and administrative facilities are located in more than 60 countries.   Danaher strives to create shareholder value primarily through three strategic priorities: \u2022strengthening our competitive advantage through consistent application of DBS tools;  \u2022enhancing our portfolio in attractive science and technology markets through strategic capital allocation; and \u2022consistently attracting and retaining exceptional talent. Danaher measures its progress against these strategic priorities over the long-term based primarily on financial metrics relating to revenue growth, profitability, cash flow and capital returns, as well as certain non-financial metrics.  To further the strategic objectives set forth above, the Company also acquires businesses and makes investments that either complement its existing business portfolio or expand its portfolio into new and attractive markets.  Given the rapid pace of technological development and the specialized expertise typical of Danaher\u2019s served markets, acquisitions, strategic alliances and investments provide the Company access to important new technologies and domain expertise.  Danaher believes there are many acquisition and investment opportunities available within its targeted markets.  The extent to which we identify, consummate and effectively integrate appropriate acquisitions and consummate appropriate investments affects our overall growth and operating results.  Danaher also continually assesses the strategic fit of its existing businesses and may separate or otherwise dispose businesses based on strategic and other considerations. In particular, we have announced our intention to separate Danaher\u2019s Environmental & Applied Solutions segment to create a publicly-traded company in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including obtaining final approval from the Danaher Board of Directors, satisfactory completion of financing and receipt of tax opinions, favorable rulings from the Internal Revenue Service and other regulatory approvals. DBS is not only the set of business processes and tools our operating companies use on a daily basis, but is more broadly our culture.  As reflected in our logo, DBS features five core values (the \u201cCore Values\u201d): 1.The Best Team Wins 2.Customers Talk, We Listen 3.Kaizen is our Way of Life 4.Innovation Defines our Future 5.We Compete for Shareholders 3 3 3     Underpinned by these five Core Values as well as our Shared Purpose \u2013 Helping Realize Life\u2019s Potential, the DBS tools are organized into four pillars that are designed to apply to every aspect of our business: Growth, Lean, Leadership and the DBS Fundamentals.   The idea for Danaher originated in the early 1980s when the Company\u2019s founders, Steven M. and Mitchell P. Rales, envisioned a business that would generate sustainable long-term value for customers, associates and shareholders.  Through a series of acquisitions and divestitures, Danaher has evolved over time into the science and technology innovator it is today.  While the operating companies that make up Danaher have changed, DBS continues to be the guiding philosophy for the Company.

Materials The Company\u2019s manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemistries, OEM products, plastics and other petroleum-based products.  Prices of oil and gas also affect the Company\u2019s costs for freight and utilities and also have an indirect impact on the cost of other purchased materials.  While the price of, and global instability with respect to the supply of, oil and gas did not materially, adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations in 2022, the Company is continuing to monitor the oil and gas commodity markets and will seek to mitigate price and/or availability risks as needed.  The Company purchases raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world.  No single supplier is material, although for some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or other qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components.  The Company utilizes a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to its supply chain, including in certain cases the use of safety stock, alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources.   The supply chain disruptions that began in 2021 for a number of our businesses continued in 2022 (including in some cases shortages of supply, cost inflation and shipping delays), as well as labor availability constraints and labor cost increases.  Through the application of DBS tools and processes (including the implementation of price increases), the Company largely mitigated the impact of these pressures on the Company\u2019s profitability and as a result these pressures did not have a material, adverse effect on the business in 2022.  These pressures continue to varying degrees as of the date of this Annual Report.  We are continuing to work with our suppliers to understand the existing and potential future impacts of these trends on our supply chain and we continue to take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts, including purchasing components in the open market and qualifying additional suppliers.  Due to the uncertainty regarding the duration and impact of these trends in 2023, there can be no assurance that these factors will not have an adverse impact on our business and financial statements in the future.  For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for the Company\u2019s operations, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Russia-Ukraine Conflict In response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, in addition to suspending sales prohibited by sanctions, the Company has suspended the shipment of products to Russia with the exception of products for the purposes of diagnosing and treating patients and producing vaccines and therapeutics.  In the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $43 million, primarily related to the impairment of accounts receivable and inventory, as well as accruals for contractual obligations related to Russian operations.  Russia has significantly reduced the export of natural gas to Europe, creating upward pressure on natural gas prices and a reduced supply of natural gas.  If this trend continues, the Company\u2019s European manufacturing facilities could face increased costs and risks of production disruptions.  The Company\u2019s European customers and suppliers could experience similar adverse impacts, which could further adversely impact the Company\u2019s supply chain and also adversely impact the demand for its products.  The Company will continue monitoring the military, social, political, regulatory and economic environment in Ukraine and Russia and its broader impacts, and will consider further actions as appropriate.  For a discussion of risks related to the Company\u2019s operations as a result of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d   Intellectual Property The Company owns numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others.  Although in aggregate the Company\u2019s intellectual property is important to its operations, the Company does not consider any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license (or any related group of any such items) to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole.  From time to time the Company engages in litigation to protect its intellectual property rights.  For a discussion of risks related to the Company\u2019s intellectual property, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d  All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, Danaher. 9 9 9   Competition Although the Company\u2019s businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, the Company\u2019s competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of its competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as the Company, or any of its segments, does.  Because of the range of the products and services the Company sells and the variety of markets it serves, the Company encounters a wide variety of competitors, including well-established regional competitors, competitors who are more specialized than it is in particular markets, as well as large companies or divisions of large companies with substantial sales, marketing, research and financial capabilities.  The Company is facing increased competition in a number of its served markets as a result of the entry of well-resourced companies into certain markets, the entry of competitors based in low-cost manufacturing locations, the development of competitive technologies by early-stage and emerging companies and increasing consolidation in particular markets.  The number of competitors varies by product and service line.  Management believes that the Company has a leadership position in many of the markets it serves.  Key competitive factors vary among the Company\u2019s businesses and product and service lines, but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price, quality and safety, performance, delivery speed, application expertise, service and support, technology and innovation, distribution network, breadth of product, service and software offerings and brand name recognition.

At the management level, our Senior Vice President of Human Resources, who reports directly to our President and CEO, is responsible for the development and execution of the Company\u2019s human capital strategy.  \u2022Recruitment   \u25e6As part of our commitment to the Core Value \u201cThe Best Team Wins\u201d, we focus on identifying, attracting and recruiting diverse talent to meet our current and future business needs.  We have invested in comprehensive talent acquisition capabilities across all levels of recruitment (including robust branding, labor market analytics, advanced sourcing tools, leading technology and streamlined processes).  Our diversity attraction efforts are an important component of our overall talent acquisition strategy and focus on: (1) establishing and fostering partnerships with diverse organizations, and (2) effectively sourcing diverse talent.  \u2022Engagement  \u25e6General.  Our engagement strategy focuses on developing the best workplace and best people leaders to meet our associates\u2019 needs every day.  Further, we believe that better associate engagement helps enable better retention and better business performance.  We assess our engagement performance through our annual Associate Engagement Survey, which addresses engagement, direct supervisor effectiveness, behavior change and performance enablement, as well as through our voluntary turnover rate. 10 10 10   \u25e6D + I.  We seek to continuously improve and sustain a diverse and inclusive culture free of systemic bias and where all associates feel they belong.  We believe a diverse workforce and culture of inclusion is essential to drive innovation, fuel growth and help ensure our technologies and products effectively serve a global customer base.  Danaher\u2019s Office of Diversity + Inclusion is led by our Vice President of Global Diversity + Inclusion, who is responsible for the execution of Danaher\u2019s D+I strategy and reports to Danaher\u2019s Senior Vice President of Human Resources.  Both serve on the Danaher Diversity + Inclusion Council along with executives who lead our businesses.  The D+I Council is responsible for overseeing Danaher\u2019s D+I strategic direction; creating D+I accountability measures; and operationalizing D+I initiatives and programming across our businesses.   We have leveraged DBS with the goal of driving progress on diversity representation and inclusive culture, including by requiring all of our operating companies to implement a D+I Policy Deployment initiative in each of 2021, 2022 and 2023.  Our D+I initiatives focus on broadening our candidate pools, sourcing diverse slates in the hiring process, developing people leaders\u2019 competency in and accountability for D+I and implementing and sustaining programs (such as our Associate Resource Groups for Women, Black, Latinx, LGBTQ and Asian descent associates and friends/allies) that offer mentorship, support and engagement to help our associates succeed and thrive.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, (1) 38% of our total associates were female and females represented 32%, 34% and 39% of our executives/senior leaders, managers and individual contributors, respectively; and (2) 41% of our total U.S. associates were People of Color and People of Color represented 24%, 31% and 43% of our U.S. executives/senior leaders, managers and individual contributors, respectively. \u25e6In support of our D+I commitment, we conduct regular pay reviews from a race (in the United States) and gender (globally) perspective that serve to proactively identify and address potential pay differences.  In 2020 we achieved base pay equity for women and for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. and in 2021 expanded the U.S. analysis to include both base pay and short-term incentive compensation.  \u2022Retention \u25e6Compensation and Benefits.  We are committed to offering competitive compensation and benefits, tailored in form and amount to geography, industry, experience and performance and designed to attract associates, motivate and reward performance, drive growth and support retention.  We have a common job architecture across our businesses to provide a standardized framework for defining jobs, job families, and career levels, and set market-aligned pay structures for each career level (adjusted as appropriate for the particular job family, industry, and geography) based on a range of compensation surveys. \u25e6Performance Management. Performance for Growth (\u201cP4G\u201d), our annual performance management program, supports our high-performance culture by seeking to ensure that high-performing associates are recognized and rewarded for their contributions.  P4G guides associates and their managers in setting clear personal performance goals aligned to our strategic priorities.  Annual reviews under the program assess performance against these formal, annual objectives and against our Core Behaviors.   \u25e6Talent Development and Career Mobility.  Our talent development program (which is generally structured to consist of 70% on-the-job learning, 20% coaching and mentoring and 10% formal training) strives to provide every associate with appropriate development opportunities.  In particular, we make available to people leaders at every level training, coaching and developmental resources to help them be effective leaders and advance their careers.  We further encourage internal promotion and mobility through our Danaher Go program, which makes open positions throughout the organization visible to associates and proactively encourages our associates to seek promotional opportunities.  We assess our performance in this area using metrics including internal fill rate (which tracks the percentages of open roles at particular levels filled by our own associates) as well as the percentage of eligible associates with completed talent assessments/career plans. \u25e6Safety and Risk Management.  Associate safety is deeply embedded in our culture.  Our Environment, Health and Safety (\u201cEHS\u201d) Policy establishes the core principles upon which our EHS management programs are built, and associates use our DBS-based \u201c4E\u201d toolkit to identify, assess and control hazards related to ergonomics, energetics, exposures and environment.  In addition, we evaluate and manage risks relating to our human capital strategy as part of Danaher\u2019s enterprise risk management program.  Key quantitative measures that we use to assess performance in this category include total recordable incident rate (defined as the number of work-related injuries or illness cases serious enough to require treatment beyond first aid, per  11 11 11   100 associates) and days away, restricted or transferred (defined as the number of work-related injuries or illness cases that result in an employee working with physical restrictions, being away from work or unable to do their job or transferring to other work, per 100 associates). The health and well-being of our associates has been a key area of focus in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We launched a global Employee Assistance Program in 2020 to ensure a consistent support structure for mental health and well-being across the Company and have since expanded the program to provide enhanced support with respect to childcare, eldercare and tutoring, among other areas.  In the United States, we have provided benefits beyond the requirements of the Families First Act, for example by extending our leave policy to cover elder care and providing for voluntary leaves even in certain circumstances not required by the law.  We have also implemented safety precautions on a facility-specific basis.    Research and Development (\u201cR&D\u201d) The Company conducts R&D activities for the purpose of developing new products, enhancing the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of its existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of its products are appropriate.  The Company\u2019s R&D efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology, and we work with a number of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products.  The Company conducts R&D activities primarily in North America, Europe and Asia and generally on a business-by-business basis.  The Company anticipates that it will continue to make significant expenditures for R&D as it seeks to provide a continuing flow of innovative products and services to maintain and improve its competitive position.  For a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d  Government Contracts Although the substantial majority of the Company\u2019s revenue in 2022 was from customers other than governmental entities, each of Danaher\u2019s segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities.  As a result, the Company is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments.  For a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d  No material portion of Danaher\u2019s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government entity.  Regulatory Matters The Company faces extensive government regulation both within and outside the United States relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of its products and services.  The following sections describe certain significant regulations that the Company is subject to.  These are not the only regulations that the Company\u2019s businesses must comply with.  For a description of the risks related to the regulations that the Company\u2019s businesses are subject to, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Medical Device Regulations Many of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d).  The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d).  The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export and record keeping for such products.  Many medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries in which they are produced or sold. Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) before introducing it into the U.S. market.  The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device.  The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device\u2019s safety and effectiveness. The process of obtaining a Section\u00a0510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to such a pre-1976 device.  A predecessor device is referred to as \u201cpredicate device.\u201d  As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. 12 12 12   Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved.  After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee.  The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device\u2019s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until the required 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Any medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state and non-U.S. agencies.  These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate inspections and other regulatory actions.  As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA.  We are required to adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cCGMP\u201d) requirements, as set forth in the Quality Systems Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d), which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting (\u201cMDR\u201d) requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.  We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) (and similar regulators in other jurisdictions).  Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as \u201coff-label\u201d promotion.  The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. In the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), our products are subject to the medical device and in vitro medical device laws of the various member states, which for many years were based on Directives of the European Commission.  However, in May 2017, the EU adopted new, formal regulations to replace such Directives; specifically, the EU Medical Device Regulation (the \u201cEU MDR\u201d) and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the \u201cEU IVDR\u201d), each of which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and in vitro devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance.  The EU regulations were adopted with staggered transitional periods that have since been updated.  In January 2023, the European Commission endorsed a proposal to extend the original compliance dates for both MDR and EU IVDR, subject to approval by the European Parliament and European Council.  The proposal would extend the current MDR transitional period deadline of May 2024 to 2027 or 2028, based upon the risk class of the device.  The EU IVDR became fully applicable in May 2022, with transition periods for certain classes of in vitro diagnostic devices extending until 2027 and the EU Commission is considering additional extensions to the EU IVDR deadlines.  Regulatory requirements in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) are also changing as a result of Brexit (the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU), and regulatory requirements in Switzerland are changing as a result of the country\u2019s withdrawal from its Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU Commission.  Complying with the EU MDR, EU IVDR and the evolving regulatory regimes in the UK and Switzerland requires modifications to our quality management systems, additional resources in certain functions and updates to technical files, among other changes, which has not and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. Other Healthcare Laws We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and various health care related laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, and the privacy and security of health information, including the U.S. federal regulations described below.  Many states, foreign countries and supranational bodies have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the U.S. federal regulations discussed above and below, including the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws. \u2022Many of our healthcare-related products are purchased by healthcare providers that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients.  The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.  As a result, many of our healthcare-related products are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare goods and services, including  13 13 13   laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud.  Third-party payers are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services and, in international markets, many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.  Price ceilings, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce usage and patient demand for the product. \u2022The U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback or bribe), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.  A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. \u2022The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) prohibits knowingly and willfully (1) executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or (2) falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.  In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, also restricts the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient identifiable health information and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information.  Similar to the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. \u2022The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program, knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government.  The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery.  In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. \u2022The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. \u2022The Open Payments Act requires manufacturers of medical devices covered under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (subject to certain exceptions) to record payments and other transfers of value to a broad range of healthcare providers and teaching hospitals and to report this data as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members to HHS for subsequent public disclosure.  Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level, and an increasing number of countries either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. In addition, some of the in vitro diagnostic drugs-of-abuse assays and reagents sold by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries contain small amounts of controlled substances, and as a result some of the Company\u2019s facilities are inspected periodically by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration to assess whether the Company properly handles, stores and disposes of controlled substances in the manufacture of those products. Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.  Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, also may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers.  Further, there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. 14 14 14   For a discussion of risks related to regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and the other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Healthcare Reform In the U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system.  There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access.  For example, in the United States, in March 2010, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act) (collectively, the \u201cPPACA\u201d) was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry.  Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medical products.  Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Data Privacy and Security Laws As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business.  For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes significant restrictions on how we collect, transmit, process and retain personal data, including, among other things, in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities with significant fines for non-compliance.  In the U.S., HIPAA privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements, and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy.  State privacy laws in California impose some of the same features as the GDPR and have prompted several other states to enact similar laws.  Additionally, a bipartisan bill under consideration in Congress would, if adopted, impose broad privacy requirements at the federal level.  Several other countries such as China and Russia have passed, and other countries are considering passing, privacy laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers or impose significant restrictions on data transfer.  For a discussion of risks related to these laws, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Environmental Laws and Regulations For a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that the Company\u2019s operations, products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies, refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.  For a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and risks related to past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Antitrust Laws The U.S. federal government, most U.S. states and many other countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive.  Violations of these laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties.  Private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages. Export/Import Compliance The Company is required to comply with various U.S. export/import control and economic sanctions laws, including: \u2022the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which, among other things, imposes license requirements on the export from the United States of defense articles and defense services listed on the U.S. Munitions List; 15 15 15   \u2022the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on the export, in-country transfer and re-export of certain dual-use goods, technology and software (which are items that have both commercial and military, or proliferation applications); \u2022the regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries, governments and persons based on United States foreign policy and national security considerations; and \u2022the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other U.S. government agencies. Other nations\u2019 governments have implemented similar export/import control and economic sanction regulations, which may affect the Company\u2019s operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions.   In addition, under U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S. are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the U.S. or between the U.S. and other countries.  If we, or third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability. For a discussion of risks related to export/import control and economic sanctions laws, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d   International Operations The Company\u2019s products and services are available worldwide, and its principal markets outside the U.S. are in Europe and Asia.  The Company also has operations around the world, and this geographic diversity allows the Company to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce, provides greater stability to its operations, allows the Company to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers the Company an opportunity to access new markets for products.  In addition, the Company believes that future growth depends in part on its ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target high-growth markets. The manner in which the Company\u2019s products and services are sold outside the U.S. differs by business and by region.  Most of the Company\u2019s sales in non-U.S. markets are made by its subsidiaries located outside the U.S., though the Company also sells directly from the U.S. into non-U.S. markets through various representatives and distributors and, in some cases, directly.  In countries with low sales volumes, the Company generally sells through representatives and distributors. Information about the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the Company\u2019s business is set forth in \u201cItem 7.  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (\u201cMD&A\u201d) included in this Annual Report.  For a discussion of risks related to the Company\u2019s non-U.S. operations and foreign currency exchange, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d   Sustainability The Company views sustainability as a fundamental responsibility and a strategic priority. Our sustainability strategy is to help generations of our stakeholders realize life\u2019s potential by innovating products that improve lives and our planet, building the best team, and protecting our environment.  This strategy aligns with Danaher\u2019s Shared Purpose and Core Values, as well as key UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) under the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our sustainability strategy is also informed by and grounded in the feedback we continually solicit from our stakeholders, including our regular sustainability prioritization assessments.  Within each of the strategic elements of our sustainability program referenced above, where feasible and appropriate, we seek to quantify our performance and set goals to encourage continuous improvement.
