{"cik": 916076, "item_1A": "ITEM 1 \u2013 BUSINESS General Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the Company or Martin Marietta) is a natural resource-based building materials company.  The Company supplies aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel) through its network of approximately 350 quarries, mines and distribution yards in 28 states, Canada and The Bahamas. In 2022, aggregates product gross profit accounted for 69% of the Company\u2019s consolidated total products and services gross profit. Martin Marietta also provides cement and downstream products, namely, ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services, in markets that are naturally vertically integrated and where the Company has a leading aggregates position. The Company\u2019s heavy-side building materials are used in infrastructure, nonresidential and residential construction projects. Aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast. The aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are reported collectively as the \u201cBuilding Materials business\u201d.  The Company also operates a Magnesia Specialties business with production facilities in Michigan and Ohio. The Magnesia Specialties business produces magnesia-based chemical products that are used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications. It also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers for steel production and soil stabilization. Magnesia Specialties\u2019 products are shipped to customers domestically and worldwide.  On April 30, 2021, the Company acquired Tiller Corporation (Tiller), a leading aggregates and hot mix asphalt supplier in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, a large and fast-growing midwestern metropolitan area. The Tiller acquisition complemented the Company\u2019s existing product offerings in the surrounding areas. Additionally, Tiller sells asphalt solely as a materials provider and does not offer paving or other associated services. Tiller is reported in the Company\u2019s East Group. On July 30, 2021, the Company acquired assets of Southern Crushed Concrete (SCC). SCC was a leading producer of recycled concrete in the Houston area, one of the country\u2019s largest aggregates markets. Recycled concrete is principally used as a base aggregates product in infrastructure, commercial and residential construction applications. SCC is reported in the Company\u2019s West Group. On October 1, 2021, the Company acquired the Lehigh Hanson West Region business (Lehigh West Region) for $2.26 billion in cash. The acquisition included a portfolio of 17 active aggregates quarries, two cement plants with related distribution terminals, and targeted downstream operations in California, Arizona, Nevada and Oregon. These operations provided a new upstream, materials-led growth platform across several of the nation\u2019s largest megaregions in California and Arizona, solidifying the Company\u2019s position as a leading coast-to-coast aggregates producer. The acquired cement plants, distribution terminals and California ready mixed concrete operations are classified as assets held for sale and discontinued operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.  The Lehigh West Region business is reported in the Company\u2019s West Group. On April 1, 2022, the Company divested its Colorado and Central Texas ready mixed concrete operations to Smyrna Ready Mix Concrete LLC. This transaction optimized the Company\u2019s aggregates-led portfolio and improved its ability to generate more attractive margins over the long term by reducing both business cyclicality and exposure to raw material cost inflation. The transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $151.9 million, inclusive of expenses incurred due to the divestiture. The divested operations and the gain on divestiture are all reported in the West Group in the Company's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. On June 30, 2022, the Company divested the Redding, California cement plant, related cement distribution terminals and 14 California ready mix operations for $235.0 million in cash. In addition, on July 15, 2022, the Company sold its interest in a joint venture that operates a cement distribution terminal for $15.0 million. These assets were acquired in connection with the acquisition of the Lehigh West Region business in 2021. On August 9, 2022, the Company announced a definitive agreement to sell the Tehachapi, California cement plant and related distribution terminals for $350.0 million in cash, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. These assets were acquired in connection with the acquisition of the Lehigh West Region. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS PRIOR TO 2021, SEE THE INFORMATION APPEARING UNDER THE HEADING \u201cGENERAL\u201d INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business Business Segment Information The Company conducts its Building Materials business through two reportable segments, organized by geography: East Group and West Group. The East Group provides aggregates and asphalt products. The West Group provides aggregates, cement, downstream products and paving services. The ten largest revenue-generating states accounted for 83% of the Building Materials business' total revenues in 2022: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Minnesota, California, Georgia, Arizona, Iowa, Florida and Indiana. The Company\u2019s Magnesia Specialties business is reported as a separate segment, which includes its magnesia-based chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses. For more information on the organization and geographic area of the Company\u2019s business segments, see \u201cNote A: Accounting Policies\u201d and \u201cNote P: Segments\u201d of the \u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, which appear in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K), which information is incorporated by reference.  Building Materials Business The profitability of the Building Materials business, which serves customers in the construction marketplace, is sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and construction cyclicality, which are in turn affected by fluctuations in levels of public-sector infrastructure funding; interest rates; access to capital markets; and demographic, geographic, employment and population dynamics. The heavy-side construction business is conducted outdoors, as are much of the Building Materials business\u2019s operations. Therefore, erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes, and other weather-related conditions, including precipitation, flooding, hurricanes, snowstorms, extreme temperatures, wildfires, earthquakes and droughts, can significantly affect production schedules, shipments, costs, efficiencies and profitability.  Generally, the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather, while the second and third quarters are subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation.  The Building Materials business markets its products primarily to the construction industry, with 35% of its 2022 aggregates shipments sold to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments sold primarily to contractors for nonresidential and residential construction projects. The Company believes the business\u2019 mix of public sector-related shipments lessens the impacts of fluctuations in nonresidential and residential, or private-sector, construction spending.  Funding of public infrastructure, historically the Company\u2019s largest end-use market, is discussed in greater detail under \u201cBuilding Materials Business\u2019 Key Considerations\u2014Public Infrastructure\u201d in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u2019\u2019 of this Form 10-K.  The Building Materials business covers a wide geographic area.  The five largest revenue-generating states (Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Minnesota and California) accounted for 64% of the Building Materials business\u2019 total revenues in 2022.  The Building Materials business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time and may be affected by a decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downtown or inflationary conditions in the future. In 2022, aggregates shipments increased 3.3%, driven primarily by a full year of shipments in the California and Arizona operations acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021. Aggregates Aggregates, consisting of crushed stone, sand and gravel, are an engineered, granular material that is manufactured to specific sizes, grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications. The Company\u2019s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries; however, the Company is the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the United States, with 14 active underground mines located in the East Group. Natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the United States. Proximity of quarry facilities to customers\u2019 construction sites or to long-haul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses.  As a general rule, the distance truck shipments travel from an individual quarry is limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself.  The Company\u2019s distribution system mainly uses trucks, but also has access to rail and waterborne networks where the per-mile unit costs of transporting aggregates are much lower.  The Company\u2019s distribution network moves aggregates materials from certain domestic and offshore sources via its long-haul rail and waterborne distribution network, to markets where aggregates supply is limited.  The Company\u2019s rail network primarily serves its Texas, Florida, Colorado and Gulf Coast markets, while the Company\u2019s locations in The Bahamas and Nova Scotia  \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business transport materials via oceangoing ships. The Company\u2019s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution facilities and port locations to offload transported material.  At December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s aggregates distribution facilities consisted of 78 terminals.  The Company\u2019s expansion of its rail-based distribution network, coupled with the extensive use of rail service, increases the Company\u2019s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance, including track congestion, crew availability, railcar availability, locomotive availability and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts.  The waterborne distribution network also increases the Company\u2019s exposure to certain risks, including, among other items, meeting minimum tonnage requirements of shipping contracts, demurrage costs, fuel costs, ship availability and weather disruptions.  The Company has long-term agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport its aggregates to various coastal ports. The Company generally acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations. Such parcels can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserves, assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining. In either instance, the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life. Some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand.  Due to the nature of the indigenous aggregates supply in the midwestern United States, a long-term capital focus for the Company is underground limestone aggregates mines. Production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregates deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher costs related to development, explosives and depreciation costs. However, these locations often possess marketplace transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries. The construction aggregates industry has been consolidating, and the Company has actively participated in the industry\u2019s consolidation.  The Company\u2019s Board of Directors and management continue to review and monitor the Company\u2019s long-term strategic plans, commonly referred to as SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review), which include assessing portfolio optimization strategies that include business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses, investing in internal expansion projects in high-growth markets, divesting businesses or nonoperating assets that are not core or do not further management\u2019s strategy and pursuing new opportunities in the Company\u2019s existing markets or new markets.  Acquisition opportunities include public companies and private sponsor-owned and family-owned businesses, as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies executing their strategic plans, rationalizing non-core assets and repairing financially-constrained balance sheets. When acquired, new locations sometimes do not satisfy the Company\u2019s internal safety, maintenance, pit development or other standards, and may require additional investments before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized.  Management believes its aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future. The Company does not anticipate any significant difficulty in accessing reserves used for production. The Company\u2019s aggregates reserves average approximately 75 years, based on the 2022 annual production level. However, certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand. Moreover, environmental, zoning and land use regulations will likely make it harder for the Company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations.  Although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal, state and local governmental bodies regarding these matters, the Company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult, thereby potentially enhancing the value of the Company\u2019s existing mineral reserves. The Company generally sells its aggregates upon receipt of customer orders or requests. The Company generally maintains inventories of aggregates products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers.  Cement and Downstream Operations Cement is the basic agent used to bind aggregates, sand and water in the production of ready mixed concrete.  Similar to aggregates, cement is used in infrastructure projects, nonresidential and residential construction, and the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries. Consequently, the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the construction sector.  The Company has a strategic and leading cement position in Texas, with production facilities in Midlothian, Texas, south of Dallas/Fort Worth, and Hunter, Texas, north of San Antonio.  These plants, which produce Portland and specialty cements, operated at 77% utilization in 2022.  Clinker is the initial product in cement production, and the two Texas production facilities have a combined annual clinker capacity of 4.5 million tons.  The Midlothian plant permit allows the Company to expand annual production by up to 0.8 million additional tons.  The Company is currently undertaking a finishing capacity expansion project at the Midlothian plant, which is expected to be completed in mid-2024 and will provide 0.5 million tons of  \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business annual incremental capacity.  Further, the Company is nearing completion of converting its plants to manufacture a less carbon-intensive Portland limestone cement, known as Type 1L, which has been approved by the Texas Department of Transportation.  In 2021, as part of the Lehigh West Region acquisition, the Company acquired a cement plant in each of Redding, California and Tehachapi, California, and several cement distribution terminals.  The Redding, California plant and related terminals were sold in June 2022 and the Tehachapi, California and related terminals are classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2022.  Calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement. The Company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its Texas cement production plants on Company-owned property. Management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at its cement plants at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future.  Cement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions. According to the Portland Cement Association, nearly two-thirds of U.S. cement consumption occurs in the six months between May and October.  Approximately 70% to 75% of all cement shipments are sent to ready-mixed concrete operators. The remainder is shipped to manufacturers of concrete-related products, contractors, materials dealers and oil well/mining/drilling companies. The Company's cement operations generally deliver their products upon receipt of customer orders or requests.  Inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers.  Energy accounted for approximately 28% of the cement total production cost profile in 2022. Therefore, cement profitability is affected by changes in energy prices and the available supply of these products.  The Company currently has fixed-price supply contracts for portions of its natural gas, power and coal needs, but also consumes alternative fuel and petroleum coke. Further, profitability of the cement operations is also impacted by kiln maintenance, which typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time. Ready mixed concrete is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers\u2019 construction projects and then typically transported by mixer trucks and poured at the project site. The aggregates used for ready mixed concrete is a washed material with limited amounts of fines (such as dirt and clay). As of December 31, 2022, the Company operates 94 ready mix plants in Arizona, California and Texas.  The California ready mixed concrete operations are classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2022 and reported as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.  Asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt, or bitumen, the binding medium, and aggregates. Similar to ready mixed concrete, each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications. As of December 31, 2022, the Company operates 38 asphalt plants in Arizona, California, Colorado and Minnesota.  The Company also offers paving services in California and Colorado.  Market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with aggregates and cement.  The cement and downstream operations results are affected by volatile factors, including energy-related costs, operating efficiencies and weather, to a greater extent than the Company\u2019s aggregates operations.  Liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete, respectively.  Therefore, fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the Company\u2019s operating results.  Magnesia Specialties Business The Magnesia Specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its Woodville, Ohio facility and manufactures magnesia-based chemical products for industrial, agricultural and environmental applications at its Manistee, Michigan facility.  These magnesia-based chemical products have varying uses, including flame retardants, wastewater treatment, pulp and paper production and other environmental applications.  In 2022, 72% of Magnesia Specialties\u2019 total revenues were attributable to chemical products, 27% to lime, and 1% to stone sold as construction materials. Magnesia Specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of customer orders or requests. Inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers. A significant portion of the 275,000-ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln at Woodville, Ohio is committed under a long-term supply contract. In 2022, 74% of the lime shipments in the Magnesia Specialties business was sold to third-party customers, while the remaining 26% was used internally as a raw material in making the business\u2019 chemical products. Dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry. In 2022, 31% of the Magnesia Specialties\u2019 total revenues were attributable to products used in the steel industry, primarily dolomitic lime. Accordingly, a portion of the revenues and profitability of the Magnesia Specialties business is affected by production and inventory trends in the steel industry.  These trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption, the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors. The dolomitic lime business runs  \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business most profitably at 70% or greater domestic steel capacity utilization.  According to the Federal Reserve, domestic steel capacity utilization averaged 75% of capacity in 2022 versus 81% of capacity in 2021.  In the Magnesia Specialties business, a significant portion of costs is of a fixed or semi-fixed nature.  The production process requires the use of natural gas, coal and petroleum coke.  Therefore, fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results.  To help mitigate this risk, the Magnesia Specialties business has fixed-price agreements for approximately 39% of its 2023 coal and natural gas needs.  For 2022, the Company\u2019s average cost per MMBtu (1,000,000 British thermal units) of natural gas increased 47% versus 2021.  Given high fixed costs, low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment\u2019s results from operations. Management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesia-based business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations.  Accordingly, these products are not as dependent on the steel industry as the dolomitic lime product line.  Management expects future organic profit growth to result from increased pricing, efficiency enhancements, rationalization of the current product portfolio and/or further cost reductions.  The principal raw materials used in the Magnesia Specialties business are dolomitic limestone and magnesium-rich brine.  Management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future. The Magnesia Specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation, particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from Woodville to Manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both Woodville and Manistee. The segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of this Form 10-K.  Patents and Trademarks As of January 31, 2023, the Company owns, has the right to use, or has pending applications for patents pending or granted by the United States and various countries and trademarks related to its business. The Company believes that its rights under its existing patents, patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations, but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the Company\u2019s business as a whole. Customers The Company\u2019s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry. Although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments, or agencies thereof.  No material part of the business as a whole, or of any segment of the Company, is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on any segment of the Company.  Competition The nature of the Company\u2019s competition varies among its products due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build and maintain production facilities. Crushed stone production from quarries or mines and sand and gravel production by dredging or otherwise are moderately capital intensive. Construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design, obtain regulatory permits, acquire equipment and construct a plant. Most domestic cement producers are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets. Many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities. Ready mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks. Accordingly, economics can lead to lower barriers to entry in some concrete markets. As a result, depending on the local market, the Company may face competition from small producers as well as large, vertically-integrated companies with facilities in many markets.  The Company operates in a largely-fragmented industry, including large, public companies and a large number of small, privately-held companies.  Other publicly traded companies among the ten-largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following: \u2022Arcosa, Inc. Arcosa, Inc. \u2022CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V. CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V. \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 5 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business \u2022CRH plc  CRH plc  \u2022Heidelberg Materials Heidelberg Materials \u2022Holcim Holcim \u2022MDU Resources Group, Inc. MDU Resources Group, Inc. \u2022Summit Materials, Inc. Summit Materials, Inc. \u2022Vulcan Materials Company Vulcan Materials Company Due to the localized nature of the industry resulting from the high cost of transportation relative to the price of the product, the Building Materials business primarily operates in smaller distinct areas that can vary from one another.  The Company believes that its ability to transport materials by rail and waterborne vessels has enhanced its ability to compete in the building materials industry.  Capacity for cement plants is often stated in terms of clinker capacity. According to the Portland Cement Association, United States cement production is widely dispersed, with the top five companies collectively producing approximately 58% of U.S. clinker capacity. An estimated 84% of U.S. clinker capacity is owned by companies headquartered outside of the United States. The Company\u2019s cement operations also compete with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports or terminals in Texas and California. The Company\u2019s ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are also in markets with numerous operators, large and small.  The Magnesia Specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality, price, technological advances and technical support for its products. While the revenues of the Magnesia Specialties business in 2022 were predominantly domestic, a portion was derived from customers located outside the United States.  Environmental and Governmental Regulations  Overview The Company\u2019s operations are subject to and affected by federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to zoning, land use, mining, air emissions (including CO2 and other greenhouse gases), water use, allocation and discharges, waste management, noise and dust exposure control, reclamation and other environmental, health and safety, and regulatory matters. Certain of the Company\u2019s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations. Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Company\u2019s operations, and such permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. Environmental Compliance and Costs The Company regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures and policies for compliance with existing laws, rules and regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies, new laws that are adopted and new laws that the Company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations, including with respect to climate change. The Company has a full-time team of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities. The direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately $35.6 million in 2022 and $31.0 million in 2021 and are related to the Company\u2019s environmental staff, ongoing monitoring costs for various matters (including those matters disclosed in this Form 10-K) and asset retirement costs. Capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately $20.0 million in 2022 and are expected to be approximately $20.0 million in 2023 and $25.0 million in 2024. The Company\u2019s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2022 and 2021. However, the Company\u2019s expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future. Despite the Company\u2019s compliance efforts, the risk of environmental liability is inherent in the Company\u2019s businesses, and environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company in the future. Complying with governmental and environmental regulations did not have and is not expected to have a material effect on the Company\u2019s capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, other than as discussed in this section. Many of the applicable requirements of environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the Company adopts as best practices in the ordinary course of its business. For example, plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may, in the ordinary course of operations, have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone. The water spray bar also  \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 6 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business serves as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws. Moreover, the Company does not separate the portion of the cost, depreciation and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is attributable only to environmental purposes, as such an allocation would be arbitrary. The incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to quantify. Accordingly, the Company records costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses. As is the case with others in the cement industry, the Company\u2019s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust (CKD). This production by-product consists of fine-grained, solid, highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices. Since much of the CKD is unreacted raw materials, it is generally permissible to recycle the CKD back into the production process, and large amounts often are treated in such manner. CKD that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills. CKD is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The environmental accruals recorded by the Company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal, state and/or local environmental protection laws. Many of these laws and their attendant regulations are complex and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts. In addition, new laws are also adopted from time to time. It is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined to which type of operations they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined. This process typically takes years to finalize, and the rules often change significantly from the time they are proposed to the time they are final. The Company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements, which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefit operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs. Management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable, although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized or amended from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances.  The Company believes that its operations and facilities, both owned or leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and any potential noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations or financial condition. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\" under Item 3 of this Form 10-K, \u201cNote O: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the \u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data,\u201d of this Form 10-K, and the \u201cEnvironmental Regulation and Litigation\" section included under Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K. However, future events, such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Mine Safety and Land Reclamation In general, mining, production and distribution facilities for aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt must comply with air quality, water quality and other environmental regulations, zoning and special use permitting requirements, applicable mining regulations, and federal health and safety requirements. As the Company locates and acquires new production and distribution facilities, the Company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries, mines, production and distribution facilities in such a way as to minimize disturbances. The Company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry, mine, production and distribution facilities can be situated at a substantial distance from surrounding property owners. Also, in certain markets, the Company\u2019s ability to transport material by rail and water allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas. The Company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations. As is the case with other similarly situated companies, some of the Company\u2019s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica, a common mineral also known as quartz. Excessive, prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases, including silicosis, and several scientific organizations and some states, such as California, have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust. The Company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures and/or makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the required levels. The Company, through safety information sheets and other means, also communicates  \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive, prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular.  The Company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use. Future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management\u2019s experience and knowledge in the industry, and are discounted to their present value using a credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate. The future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries. For additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements, see \u201cNote O: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the \u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data,\u201d of this Form 10-K. The Company performs activities on an ongoing basis, as an integral part of the normal quarrying process, that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligations. For example, the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization. This sloping and benching meets both safety regulations required by MSHA for ongoing operations as well as final reclamation requirements. Therefore, these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation.  Reclaimed quarry sites owned by the Company are from time to time available for sale, typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs, or have been converted for recreational use by the local community. Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change The Board and management have identified certain risks and opportunities below with respect to climate change, including regulatory and physical impacts, and the transition to a low-carbon economy.  Board Oversight and the Role of Management The Board of Directors has an essential role in determining the Company's strategic priorities, and climate change and other sustainability matters are an integral part of its oversight of the business. In 1994, the Company established an Ethics, Environment, Safety and Health (EESH) Committee, which currently meets at least four times annually.  The EESH Committee receives reports directly from management relating to environmental, safety, ethics and other sustainability matters, including greenhouse gas (GHG) and climate change-related matters, reviews input and engagement with investors on these matters, and monitors our compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as our public reporting and disclosure with respect to climate change-related risks and opportunities and other environmental issues. The EESH Committee reports to the full Board, and a number of other Board committees have overlapping responsibility for sustainability matters, including the Audit Committee and the Management Development and Compensation Committee.  While the Board oversees Martin Marietta's risk management, the executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day risk management processes, and management receives at least quarterly updates from operating personnel directly responsible for compliance relating to EESH matters.  Management believes this division of responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing the Company.  The Company also has a Head of Sustainability, who reports directly to the Executive Vice President and General Counsel on climate and other sustainability matters. The Company believes the above approach has been effective in integrating sustainability as a core element of its corporate governance. In an effort to mitigate the risks to the Company associated with climate change while ensuring and improving financial sustainability, the Company has adopted a corporate-wide management strategy that considers risks and opportunities related to climate change, which has resulted in multiple initiatives to identify and implement or evaluate GHG reduction processes and technologies that also improve operational efficiencies, including: using alternative fuels such as biodiesel; reducing overall fuel use by converting from quarry trucks to conveyor systems; right-sizing quarry trucks to match the appropriately sized truck with the size of production to reduce the number of required trips; replacing older railcars with more efficient, high-capacity models that reduce the number of required trips; adding rail capacity in lieu of truck movements; and installing state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at one of the Company\u2019s magnesia plants and tire processing systems for fuel, as well as a larger natural gas line, at one of the Company\u2019s cement plants. The Company\u2019s Midlothian cement plant has been recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as a high-performing, energy-efficient facility following investments in innovative air pollution control technologies and usage of alternative fuels.  Policy and Regulatory Matters A number of governmental bodies, including the U.S. Congress and various U.S. states, have proposed, enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change, including provisions for GHG emissions reporting or reductions, the use of alternative fuels, carbon credits (such as a cap-and-trade system) and a carbon tax. For example, in the United States, the USEPA promulgated a rule mandating that companies considered to be large emitters of GHGs report those emissions. The manufacturing operations of the  \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business Company\u2019s Magnesia Specialties business release carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides during the production of lime, magnesium oxide and hydroxide products. The Company\u2019s two magnesia-based chemicals facilities, as well as its two cement plants in Texas and one recently-acquired cement plant in California, file annual reports of their GHG emissions in accordance with the USEPA reporting rule. The primary business and operations of the Company, however, including its aggregates, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines, are not considered \u201cmajor\u201d sources of GHG emissions subject to the USEPA reporting rule.  Most of the GHG emissions from aggregates plant operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources, such as heavy construction and earth-moving equipment.  In 2010, the USEPA also issued a GHG emissions permitting rule, referred to as the Tailoring Rule, which may require some industrial facilities to obtain permits for GHG emissions under the U.S. Clean Air Act\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V operating permit programs. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2014 that the USEPA exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule but upheld the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirements for GHGs emitted by sources already subject to PSD or Title V permitting requirements for other pollutants. The Company\u2019s cement plants, as well as its Magnesia Specialties plants, hold Title V Permits, and each (other than the Manistee, Michigan facility) is also subject to PSD requirements.  It is currently unclear whether or how the USEPA may revise BACT requirements in the future. In fact, although several large-scale projects for carbon capture are in the development phase, no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing GHGs have yet been proven successful in large-scale applications, other than improvements in fuel efficiency. Thus, if future modifications to the Company's facilities require PSD review for other pollutants, GHG BACT requirements could be triggered and may require significant additional costs, which the Company expects would be passed on to customers. It is not currently possible to estimate the cost of any such future requirements. U.S. President Biden also has taken a number of steps to make climate change a central focus of his administration, including issuing a pair of executive orders and a presidential memorandum making climate change central to U.S. policy and setting out several administrative priorities and undertakings. President Biden reentered the Paris Agreement in January 2021 and later announced the United States\u2019 reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement, including a 50% to 52% economy-wide reduction in net GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. More recently, President Biden entered a pact with 103 countries and jurisdictions, known as the Global Methane Pledge, to reduce global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade.  In November 2021, President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJ Act), which provides billions of dollars in new funding for public transit and clean energy projects intended, in part, to address climate change, including road, bridge and other major infrastructure projects.  These projects, as well as new public transit and clean energy projects, require aggregates and cement for construction and may result in increased demand for our products.  See Other Low-Carbon Transition Risks and Opportunities section for additional information. Although it is too early to determine the actions the federal government will ultimately take to implement climate change-related orders, commitments and laws, or the full scope, timing or ramifications of such measures, it is clear that the current administration has already begun to make, and intends to continue to pursue, a significant and sweeping push on the climate front and, like other signatories to the Paris Agreement, intends to pursue a goal of a Net Zero GHG by 2050.  It also seems probable that the USEPA and other agencies will use their rule-making authority and procurement decisions to further address climate change. Various states where the Company has operations have enacted or are considering climate change initiatives as well, and the Company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed. On January 6, 2023, the USEPA proposed for public comment a reduction in the size of airborne particulate matter to fine particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter, or PM2.5, that will be regulated under its health-based, or primary, air regulations based on potential health impacts, including at-risk populations, with an adequate margin of safety. Under the Clean Air Act, which requires the USEPA to set two types of standards for particle pollution, consisting of primary standards to protect public health and secondary standards to protect public welfare, the USEPA is required to review the National Ambient Air Quality Standards every five years to determine whether they should be retained or revised. The particulate matter classifications were last revised in 2012. The new rules as currently proposed would revise the annual standard for particulate matter levels but retain the 24-hour standard. While the Company\u2019s facilities will meet any adopted standard, these changes may result in significantly higher compliance costs and risks. If and when the USEPA issues new regulations and/or Congress passes additional legislation restricting GHGs emissions, the Woodville, Ohio and Manistee, Michigan Magnesia Specialties operations, as well as the Company\u2019s cement plants in Texas and California, which release CO2 in certain of their processes and use carbon-based fuels for power equipment, kilns and the Company\u2019s mobile fleet, will likely be subject to these new regulations. The Company's three cement plants, like those of other cement operators, require combustion of significant amounts of fuel to generate high kiln temperatures and create carbon  \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 9 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business dioxide as a product of the calcination process, which is an unavoidable step in making clinker.  Accordingly, the Company continues to closely monitor GHG regulations and legislation and its potential impact on the Company's cement business, financial condition and product demand.  The Company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to GHG emission limitations at the Woodville or cement facilities would be passed on to customers. The magnesium oxide products produced at the Manistee operation, however, compete against other products that, due to the form and/or structure of the source material, require less energy in the calcination process, resulting in the generation of fewer GHGs per ton of production. Due to GHG emissions requirements, the Manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs, including for taxes or capital investments, in order to maintain competitive pricing in that market. In addition, the cement produced by the Company\u2019s cement plants, like other U.S. operators, is subject to strict limits set by the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and other agencies, including those relating to \u201cclinker substitution\u201d, or the replacement of ground clinker in cement with alternate materials such as pozzolan, slag and fly ash, which has implications for the Company\u2019s fuel use and efforts to reduce GHG emissions from its cement operations.  For example, various industry associations are engaged in an effort requesting the USDOT and other agencies to further revise their standards allowing for greater rates of clinker substitution, similar to the rates currently permitted for European cement producers.  If higher rates of substitution and blending are, in fact, permitted in the future, the result is likely to be both reduced clinker and power consumption in cement production, which would, in turn, reduce GHGs emitted in connection with each ton of cement produced in the United States. In light of the various regulatory uncertainties, the Company cannot presently reasonably predict the costs of any future compliance requirements. Nonetheless, the Company does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the Magnesia Specialties business or Building Materials business.  Physical Impacts In addition to impacts from increased regulation, climate change may result in physical impacts that could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s operations or financial condition. Physical impacts may include disruptions in production and/or regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events, shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities, as well as flooding from sea level changes. In addition, production and shipment levels for the Building Materials business correlate with general construction activity, which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weather-related conditions, which can significantly affect that business. In the Company's cement and downstream operations businesses, the physical impacts of climate change may result in disruptions to its operations or its customers\u2019 transportation activities, including impacts on production capabilities and capacities, supply chain interruptions and project delays that can impact the Company's reputation and result in additional costs to the Company.  Excessive rainfall and other severe weather jeopardize production, shipments and profitability in all markets served by the Company in its Building Materials business. In addition, climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset. In particular, the Company\u2019s operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and The Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September and October. The Company is also at risk for Pacific Ocean storm activity.  The last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the United States and particularly to Texas and the southeastern United States, notably the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, where it impacted the Company\u2019s facilities. In California and Arizona, continuing drought has led to water use restrictions in numerous water districts, and insufficient supply of water for the Company's operations in those areas could impact production.  In California, recent storms and flooding have caused operational delays and challenges. While reconstruction activities may offset some or most of the financial impacts on sales and demand, any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and operations. As the Company's footprint of quarries and aggregates facilities has grown nationwide, management believes it has bolstered resilience in its operations by maintaining a geographically diverse business and distribution network that is increasingly able to adjust to local disruptions and source materials from different facilities.  In addition, because the Company transports aggregates products by various methods, including rail and water, it may be able to mitigate supply or transportation issues in any location caused by severe weather or disruptions in any transport modality. Other Low-Carbon Transition Risks and Opportunities The Company\u2019s businesses are dependent on reliable sources of energy and fuels. The Company could incur increased costs or disruptions in its operations if the price or availability of energy or fuels or other materials used in its operations is impacted by climate change regulation or severe weather.  These and other climate-related risks, such as a downturn in the construction sector due to harsh weather, significant precipitation or other changes in weather, also could impact the Company\u2019s customers, which could lead to reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products. The Company may not be able to pass on to its customers all the costs relating to these risks. \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 10 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business Notwithstanding the foregoing risks and uncertainties relating to climate change, there may also be opportunities for the Company to increase its business or revenues, both in terms of the physical impacts of climate change and market opportunities associated with the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. For example, warm and/or moderate temperatures in March and November allow the construction season to start earlier and end later, respectively, which could have meaningful positive impacts on the Company\u2019s first- and fourth-quarter results, respectively.  From a regulatory standpoint, as noted above, the recently-passed IIJ Act provides billions of dollars in new funding for roads, bridges and other major infrastructure projects which require aggregates and cement for construction.  New public transit and clean energy projects that address climate change may also result in increased demand for our products. Other opportunities are likely to result from the passing of the $1.2 trillion IIJ Act, the Cornyn-Padilla Amendment that allows $104 billion of unused COVID-19 dollars to be directed to infrastructure projects, and $23 billion of voter-approved state and local transportation-related 2022 ballot initiatives, all of which will fund infrastructure growth, repair and development.  In addition, the Company\u2019s magnesium hydroxide products are used to increase fuel efficiency in various industries, including both coal- and gas-fired electricity generation, which has a direct impact on reducing energy use and GHG emissions by more GHG-intense companies. Finally, the desire for sustainable building solutions has led to greater recognition of the benefits of concrete construction in the effort to move to a circular economy through innovative products, longevity and recyclability, and increased demand for green construction projects would have a direct impact on the Company\u2019s cement and concrete business. Land Management The Company owns approximately 160,000 acres of land, the vast majority of which is used in connection with active facilities. The Company regularly reviews its land holdings to determine their highest and best use based on its management expertise.  Land holdings that do not have economically recoverable reserves for current or future mining or are otherwise not in locations that complement the Company\u2019s operating facilities are considered candidates for sale or development for sale.  Human Capital Resources  As of January 31, 2023, the Company has approximately 9,400 employees, of which approximately 7,000 are hourly employees and approximately 2,400 are salaried employees. Approximately 1,200 hourly employees (13% of the Company\u2019s employees) are represented by labor unions, representing 15% of the Building Materials business\u2019 hourly employees and 100% of the Magnesia Specialties segment\u2019s hourly employees. The Company\u2019s principal union contracts for the Magnesia Specialties business cover employees at the Manistee, Michigan, magnesia-based chemicals plant and the Woodville, Ohio, lime plant. The Woodville and Manistee collective bargaining agreements expire in June 2026 and August 2027, respectively. The Company believes it has good relations with its employees, including its unionized workforce. Management believes the Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. None of Martin Marietta\u2019s accomplishments are possible without its employees; the people who both drive the work and are most affected by it. These individuals are the heart of Martin Marietta. The Company\u2019s management oversees various employee initiatives to develop its employees and the Management Development and Compensation Committee regularly reviews the compensation and development programs to achieve those objectives. In 2020, the Company launched an Inclusion and Engagement Task Force, comprised of employees with diverse race, gender, background and experience, which is focused on hiring, developing and retaining diverse employees to strengthen its talent pipeline and increase employee engagement and retention. Health and safety in the workplace is one of the Company\u2019s core values. The Guardian Angel safety program provides that every employee has the right, and the obligation, to stop any unsafe condition and that zero safety incidents is achievable. It includes the notion that every employee acts as a wingman for other employees, to observe and act on any situation that potentially creates unsafe circumstances. The companywide safety performance achieved the sixth-consecutive year of world class or better lost-time incident rate and the second consecutive year for total injury incidence rate. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of keeping the Company\u2019s employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company took actions aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to implement robust protocols to protect its workforce so that they can safely perform their jobs. In 2019, the Company established a new employer brand \u2014 ONE \u2014 that reflects the thoughts, feelings and hearts of employees at every level of Martin Marietta. This included a standard approach to safety mentoring that ensures every employee has the knowledge and resources needed to complete their work safely and efficiently. The Company also established a World Class Task Force, whose mission is to improve Martin Marietta and is fostering a level of communication never before seen at the  \u00a0 Form 10-K  \u2666 Page 11 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Part I  \u2666  Item 1 \u2013 Business Company.  The Company has taken these steps to better allow it to grow responsibly and encourage employee engagement.  In 2022, the Company began launching employee resource groups starting with a Military and Veterans Community resource group.
