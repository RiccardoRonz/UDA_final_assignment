{"cik": 1463101, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business  Our Company We are a global energy technology company originally founded in March 2006 under the name PVI Solutions, Inc. in the State of Delaware and subsequently changed our name to Enphase Energy, Inc. in July 2007. We deliver smart, easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation, storage and communication on one platform. Today, our intelligent microinverters work with virtually every solar panel made, and when paired with our award-winning smart battery technology, results in one of the industry's best-performing clean energy systems. For the first time in the evolution of our centuries-old grid, people can get paid for the clean energy they produce and share with their communities, helping to build a new energy future that harnesses the sun. This clean, free, abundant source of energy can power our lives and ultimately help replace fossil fuels altogether. We have shipped approximately 58\u00a0million microinverters, and over 3.0\u00a0million\u00a0Enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more than 145\u00a0countries. We design, develop, manufacture and sell home energy solutions that manage energy generation, energy storage and control and communications on one intelligent platform. We have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductor-based microinverter that converts energy at the individual solar module level and, combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies, provides advanced energy monitoring and control. This is vastly different than a string inverter system using string modules, whether with or without an optimizer, which only converts the energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array. The Enphase\u00ae Energy System\u2122 brings a high technology, networked approach to solar generation plus energy storage, by leveraging our design expertise across power electronics, semiconductors and cloud-based software technologies. Our integrated approach to energy solutions maximizes a home\u2019s energy potential while providing advanced monitoring and remote maintenance capabilities. The Enphase Energy System uses a single technology platform for seamless management of the whole solution, enabling rapid commissioning with the Enphase\u00ae Installer App, consumption monitoring with Enphase IQ\u2122 Gateway with IQ\u2122 Combiner+, Enphase\u00ae App, a cloud-based energy management platform and our IQ\u2122 Battery. System owners can use the Enphase App to monitor their home\u2019s solar generation, energy storage and consumption from any web-enabled device. Unlike some of our competitors, who utilize a traditional inverter or offer separate components of solutions, we have built-in system redundancy in both PV generation and energy storage, eliminating the risk that comes with a single-point of failure. Further, the nature of our cloud-based, monitored system allows for remote firmware and software updates, that allows cost-effective remote maintenance and ongoing utility compliance.

IQ Microinverters. The Enphase IQ7\u2122 microinverter and Enphase IQ7+\u2122 microinverter, part of our seventh-generation IQ product family, support high-powered 60-cell and 72-cell solar modules and integrate with AC modules. Our IQ7X\u2122 microinverter addresses 96-cell PV modules up to 400W DC and, with its 97.5% California Energy Commission efficiency rating, is ideal for integration into high power modules. The IQ family of microinverters, like all of our previous microinverters, is fully compliant with NEC 2014 and 2017 rapid shutdown requirements. Unlike string inverters, this capability is built-in, with no additional equipment necessary. During 2020, we started shipping our IQ7A\u2122 microinverter for high-power monofacial and bifacial solar modules to customers in Australia and Europe. IQ7A microinverters, which we began shipping to customers in North America in November 2019, support up to 450W high-power modules, targeting high-power residential and  Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8 Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8  Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents commercial applications. Our customers will be able to pair the IQ7A microinverter with monofacial or bifacial solar modules, up to 450W DC, from solar module manufacturers who are expected to introduce high-power variants of their products in the next three years. We began shipping our Enphase Energy System with IQ8\u2122 microinverters in the fourth quarter of 2021 to customers in North America, and in the fourth quarter of 2022 to customers in France and the Netherlands. Our investment in custom application specific integrated circuit chips has resulted in a software-defined microinverter smart enough to form a microgrid. Many homeowners often assume that their solar systems will function if the sun is shining, even during a power outage. This has unfortunately not been true until the introduction of IQ8, which allows homeowners to realize the true promise of solar, to make and use their own power. IQ8 solar microinverters can provide Sunlight Backup\u2122 during an outage, even without a battery. In the second quarter of 2022, the Enphase IQ8 microinverter-based system was the first in the world to be certified by UL, a global safety science leader, to UL 1741, 3rd edition including the Supplement SB. This certification meets the new North American safety and grid interconnection standards for connecting solar inverters, energy storage systems and distributed energy resources to the grid in compliance with IEEE 1547-2018 and IEEE 1547-1 2020. AC Module (\u201cACM\u201d) products are integrated systems that allow installers to be more competitive through improved logistics, reduced installation times, faster inspection and training. We continue to make steady progress with our ACM partners, including SunPower Corporation and Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. IQ Batteries. Our Enphase IQ Battery storage systems, with usable and scalable capacity of 10.1 kWh and 3.4 kWh, are based on our Ensemble OS\u2122 energy system, which powers the world\u2019s first grid-independent microinverter-based storage system to customers in North America and has been shipping since the second quarter of 2020. The Enphase IQ Battery storage systems feature our embedded grid-forming microinverters that enable the Always-On capability that keeps homes powered when the grid goes down and the ability to save money when the grid is up. These systems are now compatible with both new and existing Enphase IQ solar systems with M-series\u2122, IQ6\u2122 and IQ7 microinverters. In January 2021, we announced expanded compatibility of the Enphase Energy System with our M-series microinverters and string inverters. The expanded compatibility provides approximately 300,000 additional Enphase system owners with the possibility of achieving grid-agnostic energy resilience through the Enphase Upgrade Program. The program provides solar installers the opportunity to renew engagements with the installed base of Enphase system owners through microinverter, solar and energy storage upgrades and reflects our continued commitment to reliability, service and long-term customer relationships. We currently ship our Enphase IQ Battery storage systems to customers in North America, Belgium and German. Enphase IQ Batteries in Belgium and Germany can be installed with both single-phase and three-phase third-party solar energy inverters, enabling homeowners to upgrade their existing home solar systems with a residential battery storage solution that reduces costs while providing increased self-reliance. During the second quarter of 2021, we introduced our IQ\u2122 Load Controller for our Enphase IQ Battery storage systems. Load control allows homeowners to decide what gets power in their home in the event of a grid outage, with the ability to choose up to four loads. These loads will be on when the grid is present and shed automatically in the event of a grid failure. This product makes installation simpler and saves time for installers. Our Enphase Energy System integrates with most leading models of home standby AC generators, providing enhanced performance and a glitch-free transition for homeowners during power outages. Homeowners can also monitor real-time power flow, start and stop their generator remotely, set quiet hours to prevent their generator from operating until their batteries fall below a designated threshold, and control it all with the Enphase App. The new feature functions without a generator automatic transfer switch and is designed to eliminate the power glitches that reset home electronic appliances when switching to generator power. Our home energy systems are architected to efficiently manage generation, storage and consumption resources in the home to ensure the best customer experience. During 2022, we announced that Enphase IQ Batteries officially support the most common third-party solar energy string inverters in Belgium and Germany, helping meet the increasing demand for energy independence in the region. In October 2022, we acquired GreenCom Networks AG (\u201cGreenCom\u201d), which allows us to provide Internet of Things software (IoT) solutions for customers to connect and manage a wide range of distributed energy devices within the home. This acquisition allows us to add a local engineering team in France and Germany to service the accelerating clean energy transition in Europe, provide installers with a complete home energy management system  Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9 Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9  Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents integrating Enphase microinverters and batteries with third-party EV chargers and heat pumps, and enable homeowners to monitor and control their devices from the Enphase App. Electric Vehicle Chargers. In December 2021, we acquired ClipperCreek, Inc. (\u201cClipperCreek\u201d), which allows us to offer EV charging solutions for residential and commercial customers in the United States. The increasing penetration of EVs has implications for home energy management, as households not only consume significantly more power with an EV, but also have a large battery that can be used for both backup and grid service. Our EV chargers are compatible with most EVs sold in North America. Grid Services. We participate in the ConnectedSolutions program, which is an incentive program implemented by two utilities in the Northeast region of the United States to reduce electrical demand during high-use periods. Enphase storage customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island can sign-up, monitor, track money earned and control participation in the program using the Enphase App. We announced during the third quarter of 2021 our participation in Hawaiian Electric\u2019s Battery Bonus grid services program. This program offers a new incentive for homeowners on the island of Oahu to install a new home battery. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced our participation in the Arizona Public Service (\u201cAPS\u201d) residential battery services program. The APS program offers homeowners who install Enphase IQ Batteries in its service territory the chance to participate and earn money through one-time, upfront incentives. In addition, we announced during the first quarter of 2022 that the Vermont-based utility Green Mountain Power (\u201cGMP\u201d) will offer Enphase Energy Systems to its customers in a cutting-edge battery lease grid services pilot program. Homeowners can also enroll in GMP\u2019s \u201cBring Your Own Device\u201d grid services program, which allows customers with their own Enphase Energy Systems to participate and earn an up-front incentive. These grid services programs enable utilities to leverage the IQ Battery instead of turning on polluting peaker plants, while generating an income stream for the IQ Battery owner. Although these programs do not currently drive material revenues, we believe that facilitating grid services participation for our customers can reduce the lifetime cost of IQ Batteries and help drive increased demand for our Enphase Energy Systems. In December 2022, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (\u201cPG&E\u201d) and Enphase announced the launch of a fixed power solutions pilot program, Residential Storage Initiative, in which PG&E is providing free Enphase IQ Battery storage systems to approximately 100 low-income residential customers that have been the most frequently impacted by outages as a result of PG&E\u2019s Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings. Customers participating in the pilot will be auto enrolled in the PG&E Power Saver Rewards program, where they can earn money and help California avoid power interruptions by reducing consumption and utilizing energy stored in their battery systems during times of high demand. Enphase Installer Platform. In January 2021, we acquired Sofdesk Inc. (\u201cSofdesk\u201d), which allows us to provide design and proposal software.

The principal areas in which we compete with other companies include: \u2022product performance and features; \u2022total cost of ownership; \u2022breadth of product line; \u2022local sales and distribution capabilities; \u2022module compatibility and interoperability; \u2022reliability and duration of product warranty; \u2022technological expertise; \u2022brand recognition; \u2022customer service and support; \u2022compliance with industry standards and certifications; \u2022compliance with current and planned local electrical codes; \u2022integration with storage offerings; \u2022size and financial stability of operations; \u2022size of installed base; and \u2022local manufacturing and product content. In an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter, the solar PV modules are connected in series strings. In a large installation, there are multiple series strings connected in parallel. The aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter. We believe that traditional string inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar power systems, including the following: \u2022Productivity limits. If solar modules are wired using a traditional central inverter\u2014group or \u201cstring\u201d of modules are wired in series, and an entire string\u2019s output is limited by the output of the lowest-performing module. Because of its string design, there is a single point of failure risk with the traditional string inverter approach. \u2022Reliability issues. Traditional string inverters are the single most common component of solar installations to fail, resulting in system downtime and adversely impacting total energy output. As a result, string inverters typically carry warranties of only 5 to 10 years. \u2022Complex design and installation requirements. The string inverter-based solar PV installation requires greater effort on the part of the installer, both in terms of design and on-site labor. String inverter installations require string design and calculations for safe and reliable operation, as well as specialized equipment such as direct current (\u201cDC\u201d) combiners, conduits and disconnects. In addition, the use of high-voltage DC requires specialized knowledge and training and safety precautions to install string inverter technology. \u2022Safety issues. String inverter solar PV installations have a wide distribution of high-voltage (600 volts to 1,000 volts) DC wiring. If damaged, DC wires can generate sustained electrical arcs, reaching temperatures of more than 5,000 \u00b0F. This creates the risk of fire for solar PV installation owners and injury for installers and maintenance personnel. These challenges of traditional string inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners: \u2022Installer. Solar PV installers aim for simple installation design, fast installation times and maximum system performance and predictability. The installation of high-voltage DC string inverter technology, however,  Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11 Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11  Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents requires significant preparation, precautionary safety measures, time-consuming string calculations, extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment, training and knowledge. Together, these factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer. \u2022System owner. Solar power system owners aim for high energy production, low cost, high reliability, and low maintenance requirements, as well as reduced fire risks. With traditional string inverters, owners often are unable to optimize the size or shape of their solar PV installations due to string design limitations. As such, they experience performance loss from shading and other obstructions, can face frequent system failures and lack the ability to effectively monitor the performance of their solar PV installation. In addition, string inverter installations operate at high-voltage DC, which bears significant fire risks. Further, due to their large size, string inverter installations can affect architectural aesthetics of the house or commercial building. Several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger than us and may have greater financial, marketing, distribution and customer support resources and may have significantly broader brand recognition, especially in certain markets. In addition, some of our competitors have more resources and experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for these offerings. Competitors in the inverter market include, among others, SolarEdge Technologies, Inc., Fronius International GmbH, SMA Solar Technology AG, AP Systems, Generac Holdings Inc., Tesla, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Delta, Ginglong, Sungrow, Solax, Hoymiles and other companies offering microinverters and string inverters with and without solar optimizers. We believe that our microinverter solutions offer significant advantages and competitive differentiation relative to traditional central or string inverter technology, even when supplemented by DC-to-DC optimizers on the roof.  Competitors in the storage market include Tesla, SolarEdge, LG Chem, Sonnen, Generac, Panasonic, BYD, E3/DC, Senec, Schneider, Briggs & Stratton and other producers of battery cells and integrated storage systems market. Competitors in the EV charger market include Wallbox, ChargePoint, Tesla, JuiceBox and EVBox, among others.

Intellectual Property We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success. We protect our technology through a variety of means, including through patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other countries, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 268 issued U.S. patents, 101 issued foreign patents, 69 pending U.S. patent applications and 118 pending foreign counterpart patent applications. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2023 and 2046.  We have licensed certain technologies for application in hardware and software in our products. Such licenses are generally fully-paid, royalty-free licenses. Given the volume and pace of new patents worldwide, it may become necessary in the future to license intellectual property on terms that are yet unknown to us, and that may be less favorable than licenses in the past. In addition, we license open source software from various third parties for use in hardware and software. Such open source software is licensed under open source licenses, and we take efforts to maintain compliance with such licenses. We continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe provide significant competitive advantages. A majority of our patents relate to DC to AC power conversion, energy storage devices and related energy environments. With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our microinverter and storage manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms and procedures.

Government Regulations Our business activities are subject to a changing patchwork of laws and regulations that prevail at the federal, state, regional and local level as well as in those foreign jurisdictions. For example, substantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures and results of operations. We are also subject to other complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations related to anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws and data privacy laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, among others. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the future. In February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The United States and certain other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia and could impose further sanctions, which could further damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. While we do not have sales or operations in Russia or Ukraine, it is possible that the conflict or actions taken in response, could adversely affect some of our markets and suppliers, the broader economic and financial markets, or costs and availability of components and materials, or cause further supply chain disruptions.  Government Incentives U.S. federal, state and local government bodies, as well as non-U.S. government bodies provide incentives to owners, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, lower VAT rate and other financial incentives, such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. The market for on\u2011grid applications, where solar power is used to supplement a customer\u2019s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff, often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives, which vary by geographic market and from time to time, thus helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power. The disallowance or changes in government subsidies or economic incentives could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Among other government-established incentives, net metering and related policies have supported the growth of on-grid solar products, and changes to such policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from our solar service offerings. Net metering provides for the compensation of a customer\u2019s excess solar generation to the electrical grid. In August 2022, the IRA was enacted, which includes extension of the investment tax credit (\u201cITC\u201d) as well as a new advanced manufacturing production tax credit (\u201cAMPTC\u201d), to incentivize clean energy component sourcing and production, including for the production of solar related components, battery cells and battery packs. The IRA provides for an AMPTC on microinverters of 11 cents per alternating current watt basis. The AMPTC for each component including on microinverters decreases by 25% each year beginning in 2030 and ending after 2032. Under the IRA, the ITC was extended until 2032 to allow a qualifying homeowner to deduct 30% of the cost of installing residential solar systems from their U.S. federal income taxes, thereby returning a material portion of the purchase price of the residential solar system to homeowners. Under the terms of the current extension, the ITC will remain at 30% through the end of 2032, reduce to 26% for 2033, reduce to 22% for 2034 and further reduce to 0.0% after the end of 2034 for residential solar systems, unless it is extended before that time. We believe the enactment of the IRA is favorable to our overall business worldwide; however, we are continuing to evaluate the  Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14 Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14  Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents overall impact and applicability of the IRA to our results of operations going forward, including the revisions to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, which includes a 15% corporate minimum income tax and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the California\u2019s Public Utilities Commission (\u201cCPUC\u201d) approved and voted for a new net metering policy, called Net Energy Metering 3.0 (\u201cNEM 3.0\u201d), which will be in effect starting April 15, 2023. The new policy reduces the compensation earned by solar customers selling extra energy to the grid by a substantial amount. The average export rate in California is expected to be approximately $0.05/kWh to $0.08/kWh when effected compared to current average of $0.25/kWh to $0.35/kWh. NEM 3.0 in California may reduce demand for solar PV systems, including our future inverter sales.  Seasonality Historically, the majority of our revenues are from the North American and European regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second, third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends, including weather patterns and construction cycles. The first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry, due to these same factors. Although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.   Environment and Climate Change We have understood the climate change threat from the beginning and have been creating clean energy technologies needed to directly combat it, protect our environment and enable sustainable development. We recognize our ability to do so rests on our capacity to understand, anticipate and successfully navigate various types of climate risk. Our strategy is advancing solutions to meet any number of climate risk mitigation opportunities \u2013 solar energy equipment, battery storage, EV charging, smart load management and integration with grid modernization efforts. We align our risk assessment and climate strategy with the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) and emerging climate-risk disclosure recommendations from the International Financial Reporting Standards foundation. We issued our second TCFD aligned Environmental, Social and Governance Report in 2022 and plan to follow up with another aligned report in 2023. We believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to designing products that address both energy generation and consumption. We continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics and advancing a sustainable future for all.   Human Capital Resources As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had 2,821 full-time employees. Of the full-time employees, 952 were engaged in research and development, 1,169 in sales and marketing, 239 in general and administration, 316 in design permitting services and 145 in manufacturing and operations. Of these employees, 1,002 were in the United States, 1,424 in India, 107 in New Zealand, 161 in Europe, 43 in Canada, 26 in Australia, 25 in China, 23 in Mexico and 10 in Brazil. None of our employees are represented by a labor union; however, our employees in France are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any employment-related work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Culture Supporting our purpose of \u201cAdvancing a sustainable future for all,\u201d all employees are expected to uphold the following core values that drive our culture: \u2022Customer First \u2022Integrity \u2022Innovation \u2022Teamwork Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15 Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15  Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Quality These core values are represented by how we work together, how we perform and how we all get rewarded. Values are reinforced in new hire training, culture workshops and everyday interactions.  Talent Our talent and culture are critical to our success. Our human capital management philosophy and objectives focus on creating a high-performance culture in which our employees deliver, succeed and lead. We achieve our objectives through various employee engagement and talent development efforts. Our employee engagement efforts include our quarterly all-employee town hall meetings, through which we aim to keep our employees well-informed and to increase transparency, and employee engagement surveys, through which we incorporate critical employee feedback into our culture, operations and strategic plans. We have established relationships with top universities worldwide, professional associations and industry groups to build a talent pipeline and established the Enphase Learning Academy to provide employees with on demand relevant technical and professional programs. We are committed to promoting and cultivating an inclusive and diverse culture that welcomes and celebrates everyone without bias. In addition, we look to actively engage within our communities to foster and attain social equity. We became a corporate sponsor of the non-profit Women in Cleantech and Sustainability and our Chief Executive Officer signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge. This shows our commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Compensation Philosophy Our compensation philosophy creates the framework for our rewards strategy. We have a pay-for-performance culture that ties compensation to the performance of the individual and our company. We provide competitive compensation programs that focus on the following five key elements: \u2022Pay-for-performance: Reward and recognize leading contributors and high potential employees by paying market competitive total direct compensation, which includes base salary, quarterly bonus or commission, and stock-based compensation; \u2022External market-based research: Pay levels that are competitive with respect to the labor markets and industries in which we compete for talent; \u2022Internal equity: Maintaining internally consistent and non-discriminatory pay and pay practices; \u2022Fiscal responsibility: Providing programs in line with economic conditions and our company\u2019s financial health; and \u2022Legal compliance: Ensure the organization is legally compliant with employee compensation laws in all states and countries in which we operate. Health and Wellness We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives. Our benefits packages provide a balance of protection along with the flexibility to meet the individual needs of our employees. Our global work-from-home policy introduced in response to COVID-19 pandemic is still in effect, but modified to allow employees in certain countries and locations to work in a hybrid mode as business necessitate. We are conducting business as usual with no major restrictions to employee travel unless mandated by laws in different countries. We expect these business operating conditions will substantially remain in effect throughout 2023. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and we will make further changes to our business operations as may be permitted by federal, state, or local authorities and that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees and business partners, and we strive to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, in part, by providing technology to our employees, end-customers and business partners to help them do their best work while remote.
