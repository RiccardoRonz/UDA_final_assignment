{"cik": 1280452, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01.  Business \u00a0 General \u00a0 Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.\u00a0(\u201cMPS\u201d) is a fabless\u00a0company with a global footprint that provides high-performance, semiconductor-based power electronic\u00a0solutions. Incorporated in 1997, our three core strengths include deep system-level knowledge, strong semiconductor expertise, and innovative proprietary technologies in the areas of semiconductor processes, system integration, and packaging. These combined advantages enable us to deliver reliable, compact, and monolithic solutions\u00a0found in storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer applications. Our mission is to\u00a0reduce\u00a0energy and material consumption to improve all aspects of quality of life.\u00a0We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy-efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions. We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories. \u00a0 Our principal executive office is located in Kirkland, Washington. We have over 3,200 employees worldwide, with locations in Asia\u00a0(primarily in China,\u00a0India, Japan, South\u00a0Korea, Singapore and Taiwan), Europe (primarily in France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and the United States. \u00a0 Industry Overview \u00a0 Semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment. Within the semiconductor industry, components can be classified either as discrete devices, such as individual transistors or integrated circuits (\u201cICs\u201d), in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit. ICs can be further divided into three primary categories: digital, analog, and mixed-signal. Digital ICs, such as memory devices and microprocessors, can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes. Analog ICs, in contrast, handle real world signals such as temperature, pressure, light, sound, or speed. In addition, analog ICs also perform power management functions, such as regulating or converting voltages, for electronic devices. Mixed-signal ICs combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world to digital systems. \u00a0 Analog and Mixed-Signal Markets.\u00a0We focus on the market for high performance analog and mixed-signal ICs. High performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors, which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip, greater precision, better power efficiency and density, higher speed and lower heat and noise. There are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixed-signal IC markets\u00a0from digital IC markets. These factors include longer product life cycles,\u00a0numerous market segments, technology\u00a0that is difficult to replicate, relative complexity of design and process technologies, importance of experienced design engineers, lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets.\u00a0 We have\u00a0targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above-average growth over the long term\u00a0compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole. \u00a0 End Markets and Applications \u00a0 We design and develop\u00a0our products for\u00a0the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets, with the storage and computing market representing the largest portion of our revenue in 2022. The following table is a summary of the various end market applications for\u00a0our products, and those markets\u2019\u00a0contribution as a percentage of our total revenue: \u00a0 Percentage of Total Revenue End Markets Applications 2022 2021 2020 Storage and computing Storage applications, enterprise notebooks, computers and printers Enterprise Data Data center and workstation computing Automotive Infotainment, digital cockpits and connectivity applications Industrial Power sources, smart\u00a0meters, security applications\u00a0and industrial automation Communications 5G and satellite communications infrastructure applications Consumer Home appliances, gaming consoles, smart TVs, mobile devices, lighting, monitors,\u00a0stereos, set-top boxes and\u00a0chargers \u00a0 \n\n     5\n   \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n     5\n    \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Product Families \u00a0 Our proprietary process technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller, single-chip power management ICs. These technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications\u00a0within the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets. Our product families are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy, power efficiency, quality and longevity, making them cost-effective and more sustainable relative to many competing solutions. Our key product families include the following: \u00a0 Direct Current (\u201cDC\u201d) to DC Products.\u00a0DC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as portable electronic devices, wireless LAN access points, computers and notebooks, monitors, infotainment applications\u00a0and medical equipment. We believe that our DC to DC products are differentiated in the market, particularly with respect to their high degree of integration, high voltage operation, high load current, high switching speed, small footprint, and high energy efficiency. These features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components that need to be produced and consumed, a smaller form factor, more accurate regulation of voltages, lower power consumption and, ultimately, lower system cost, increased reliability and lower carbon emissions through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices. The DC to DC product family accounted for\u00a095% of our total revenue in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020.\u00a0 \u00a0 Lighting Control Products.\u00a0Lighting control ICs are used in backlighting and general illumination products. Lighting control ICs for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for LCD panels typically found in computers and notebooks, monitors, car navigation systems and televisions. Backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps. The Lighting Control product family accounted for\u00a05% of our total revenue in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020. \u00a0 In the future, we plan to\u00a0continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative\u00a0product categories. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to continue to innovate while fulfilling our customers\u2019 evolving needs, enter new market segments, gain market share, grow in regions outside of China, Taiwan and other Asian markets, expand our customer base and continue to\u00a0secure manufacturing capacity. \u00a0 Customers, Sales and Marketing \u00a0 We sell our products through third-party distributors, value-added resellers and directly to original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), original design manufacturers\u00a0(\u201cODMs\u201d), electronic manufacturing service (\u201cEMS\u201d) providers and other end customers. Our third-party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us, which allow the distributors to sell our products to end customers and other resellers, including\u00a0OEMs, ODMs or EMS providers.\u00a0Our value-added resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers. ODMs typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of OEMs, and EMS providers typically provide manufacturing services for OEMs and other electronic product suppliers.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Sales to our largest distributor accounted for 24% of our total revenue in 2022, 26% in 2021, and 24% in 2020. In addition to our largest distributor, one distributor accounted for 19% of our total revenue in 2022,\u00a0two distributors accounted for 15% and 10% of our total revenue in 2021, and one distributor accounted for 11% of our total revenue in 2020. No other distributors or end customers accounted for more than 10% of our full-year, total revenue in any of the periods presented. \u00a0 Current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the non-exclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products. These agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 90\u00a0days from the date of invoice.\u00a0In addition, we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements. \u00a0 We have sales offices in China, India, Japan, South\u00a0Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, the United States and throughout Europe. Our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application.\u00a0We maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers\u2019 engineers in the development of their systems\u2019 electronics containing our products. \u00a0 Because our sales are primarily billed and payable in United States dollars, our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates. However, because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to customers in Asia, changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, our revenue from sales to customers in Asia was 86%, 90% and 91%, respectively. \u00a0 Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped. Because orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement, and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period, we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue.\u00a0 \u00a0 Typical supply chain lead times for orders are generally 16\u00a0to 26 weeks.\u00a0We often build inventory in advance based on our forecast of future customer orders. This subjects us to certain risks, most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast, which could lead to inventories in excess of demand. If excess inventory exists, it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount, take a significant write-down or dispose of it altogether, all of which would negatively affect our profit margins. In addition, in response to market conditions, we may slow the rate of manufacturing our products, which could result in insufficient inventory levels if we underestimate the demand for our products. \u00a0 \n\n     6\n   \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n     6\n    \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Research and Development \u00a0 We have assembled a qualified team of engineers primarily in China, Taiwan, the United States, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, and Hungary, with core competencies in analog and mixed-signal design. Through our research and development efforts, we have developed a collection of intellectual property and know-how that we are able to leverage across our products and markets. These include the development of high efficiency power devices, the design of precision analog circuits and systems, expertise in mixed-signal design, and integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies. \u00a0 Our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas: systems architecture, circuit design and implementation, and process technologies. In the area of systems architecture, we are exploring new ways of solving our customers\u2019 system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities. In the area of circuit design and implementation, our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products. In the area of process technologies, we are investing in research and development resources to provide leading-edge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits. We believe process technologies\u00a0are key strategic components to our future growth.\u00a0 \u00a0 Our growth is fueled by our customers\u2019 need for our power efficient solutions. Consequently, we focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products in our research and development efforts in all three targeted areas. Our products are principally positioned as achieving lower power loss and enabling significant reductions in circuit board space and shrinking or eliminating many passive components that are otherwise needed by competitors\u2019 offerings. In addition, the life cycles of our products are typically over 10 years, reducing the manufacturing needs and associated carbon emissions associated with production of replacement products. \u00a0 Patents and Intellectual Property Matters \u00a0 We rely on our proprietary technologies, which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies. \u00a0 In general, we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,557\u00a0patents/applications issued or pending, of which 546\u00a0patents have been issued in the United States. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through December 2042.\u00a0Our patents are material to our business, but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success. We also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees\u2019 commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology, know-how and processes. We also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate. We have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business. Despite precautions that we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. There can be no assurance that the steps we take are adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business. \u00a0 The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims. Such litigation can\u00a0be very costly and may divert our management resources. Further, we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products. In the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers, we could be enjoined from selling selected products, could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers, or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties. If any of our products are found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms, we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. \u00a0 \n\n     7\n   \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n     7\n    \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Manufacturing \u00a0 We utilize a fabless business model, working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ICs. This fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures. In contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies, which\u00a0utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners, we have developed our own proprietary process technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use on our behalf. This close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ICs. \u00a0 We currently contract with several suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in China, Taiwan and South\u00a0Korea. Once our silicon wafers have been produced, they are shipped to our facilities in Chengdu, China for wafer sort, which is a testing process performed to identify non-functioning dies. Our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in China and Malaysia. The assembled ICs are then sent either for final testing at our Chengdu facilities, or to other turnkey providers who perform final testing based on our standards prior to shipping to our customers. \u00a0 Our manufacturing facilities\u00a0in Chengdu, China, enable us to benefit from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs. We have expanded our product testing capabilities in these facilities and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations. \u00a0 Competition \u00a0 The analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel, our ability to introduce new products, and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products, and our ability to meet our\u00a0and customers\u2019 energy efficiency goals. Our industry is characterized by decreasing average selling prices over the life of a product. We compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products and, in some cases, have a broader number of product offerings that may enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers and engage sales partners. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with several manufacturers of such products, of varying size and financial strength. We consider our primary competitors to include Analog Devices, Infineon Technologies, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Power Integrations, Renesas Electronics, ROHM Semiconductor, Semtech and Texas Instruments. \u00a0 We expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market. We believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell and on the basis of key competitive factors in our industry, particularly because our ICs typically are smaller in size, are highly integrated with lower energy consumption, possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competitors. However, there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market. In addition, there has recently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. If these or future acquisitions are successful, competition may intensify\u00a0and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us. \u00a0 We operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry. While we are not immune from\u00a0industry downturns, we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term. \u00a0 Historically, our revenue has generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half\u00a0although various factors, such as market conditions and the timing of key product introductions, could impact this\u00a0trend. \u00a0 Government Regulations \u00a0 We are subject to international, federal and local legislation, regulations, and other requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment; the treatment, transport, and disposal of hazardous wastes; recycling and product packaging; worker health and safety; and other activities affecting the environment, our workforce, and the management of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our operations and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. \u00a0 We are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business. In recent years, these controls, tariffs, regulations, and restrictions have had, and we believe may continue to have, a material impact on our business, including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components. \u00a0 Government regulations can be complex and are subject to change in the future, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. Our efforts to comply with these government regulations could have material impacts on our capital expenditures and operating expenses, revenue, resource allocation, competitive position, or financial condition, though the magnitude and duration of such impacts are uncertain and difficult to quantify. Refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion of material risks related to government policies and regulations on environmental laws, international trade policies and restrictions, including tariffs on imports of foreign goods and regulations restricting the export of goods and services between the U.S. and China. \u00a0 \n\n     8\n   \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n     8\n    \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Human Capital  \u00a0 Our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. Due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixed-signal ICs, our engineers generally have many years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude.\u00a0Analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace. The loss of the services of key officers, managers, engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel.\u00a0We may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization, and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 3,247 employees primarily\u00a0in Asia, Europe, South America and the United States, compared with 2,773 employees as of December 31, 2021. \u00a0 Competition for talent in the semiconductor industry is strong, and compensation is critical\u00a0to our recruiting and retention philosophy, especially given our rapid growth and our need to attract talented employees with a broad range of skills. Our total compensation packages are competitive, fair, and structured to encourage employees to invest in our future. Our employee benefits programs include a combination of supplemental benefits including paid time off for holidays and vacations, health insurance and other plan benefits. \u00a0 We are an equal-opportunity employer, and we make employment decisions based on merit and business needs. We are committed to providing a healthy and safe environment for all our workers. Our Worker Health and Safety Plan is certified to ISO 45001 standards, the world\u2019s voluntary, international standard for occupational health and safety. We believe that certifying to these standards enables our company to provide safe and healthy workplaces by preventing work-related injury and health issues. \u00a0 Available Information \u00a0 Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports that are\u00a0filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge.
