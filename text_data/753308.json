{"cik": 753308, "item_1A": "Item 1.  Business   OVERVIEW  NEE is one of the largest electric power and energy infrastructure companies in North America and a leader in the renewable energy industry. NEE has two principal businesses, FPL and NEER. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. FPL\u2019s strategic focus is centered on investing in generation, transmission and distribution facilities to deliver on its value proposition of low customer bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy for the benefit of its approximately 5.8\u00a0million customer accounts. NEER is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun, as well as a world leader in battery storage. NEER\u2019s strategic focus is centered on the development, construction and operation of long-term contracted assets throughout the U.S. and Canada, primarily consisting of clean energy assets such as renewable generation facilities and battery storage projects, and electric transmission facilities.  In January 2019, NEE acquired Gulf Power Company, a rate-regulated electric utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in northwest Florida. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However, during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities in the former service areas of FPL and Gulf Power Company. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one electric ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs (see FPL \u2013 FPL Regulation \u2013 FPL Electric Rate Regulation \u2013 Base Rates \u2013 Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025).  As described in more detail in the following sections, NEE seeks to create value in its two principal businesses by meeting its customers' needs more economically and more reliably than its competitors. NEE's strategy has resulted in profitable growth over sustained periods at both FPL and NEER. Management seeks to grow each business (see Note 15 \u2013 Commitments) in a manner consistent with the varying opportunities available to it; however, management believes that the diversification and balance represented by FPL and NEER is a valuable characteristic of the enterprise and recognizes that each business contributes to NEE's financial strength in different ways. FPL and NEER share a common platform with the objective of lowering costs and creating efficiencies for their businesses. NEE and its subsidiaries, with employees totaling approximately 15,300 as of December\u00a031, 2022, continue to develop and implement enterprise-wide initiatives focused on improving productivity, process effectiveness and quality.   On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law which, among other things, extends the period for wind and solar tax credits and expands the tax credits to support a broader range of renewable technologies. See NEER \u2013 Clean Energy and Other Operations \u2013 Clean Energy \u2013 Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects. NEE believes the IRA provides long-term visibility and supports the growth of its businesses.   As of January 1, 2022, NEE's segments for financial reporting purposes are FPL and NEER (see Note 16). NEECH, a wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, owns and provides funding for NEE's operating subsidiaries, other than FPL and its subsidiaries. NEP, an affiliate of NextEra Energy Resources, acquires, manages and owns contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows. See NEER section below for further discussion of NEP. The following diagram depicts NEE's simplified ownership structure:    4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents       FPL  FPL is a rate-regulated electric utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in Florida. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. At December\u00a031, 2022, FPL had approximately 32,100 MW of net generating capacity, approximately 88,000 circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines and 871 substations. FPL provides service to its electric customers through an integrated transmission and distribution system that links its generation facilities to its customers. FPL also owns a retail gas business, which serves approximately 119,000 residential and commercial natural gas customers in eight counties throughout southern Florida with 3,795 miles of natural gas distribution pipelines.  FPL serves more than 12 million people through approximately 5.8\u00a0million customer accounts. The following map shows FPL's service areas and plant locations as of February\u00a017, 2023, which cover most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and are in nine counties throughout northwest Florida (see FPL Sources of Generation below).       5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents    CUSTOMERS AND REVENUE  FPL's primary source of operating revenues is from its retail customer base; it also serves a limited number of wholesale customers within Florida. The percentage of FPL's operating revenues and customer accounts (as of December 31, 2022) by customer class were as follows:     For both retail and wholesale customers, the prices (or rates) that FPL may charge are approved by regulatory bodies, by the FPSC in the case of retail customers and by the FERC in the case of wholesale customers. In general, under U.S. and Florida law, regulated rates are intended to cover the cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Since the regulatory bodies have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed, there can be no guarantee that FPL will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of its costs through regulated rates. See FPL Regulation below.  FPL seeks to maintain attractive rates for its customers. Since rates are largely cost-based, maintaining low rates requires a strategy focused on developing and maintaining a low-cost position, including the implementation of ideas generated from cost savings initiatives.   FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS AND COMPETITION  FPL's service to its electric retail customers is provided primarily under franchise agreements negotiated with municipalities or counties. During the term of a franchise agreement, which is typically 30 years, the municipality or county agrees not to form its own utility, and FPL has the right to offer electric service to residents. At December\u00a031, 2022, FPL held 225 franchise agreements with various municipalities and counties in Florida with varying expiration dates through 2052. These franchise agreements cover the vast majority of FPL's retail customer base in Florida. At December\u00a031, 2022, FPL also provided service to customers in 11 other municipalities and to 27 unincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements pursuant to the general obligation to serve as a public utility. FPL relies upon Florida law for access to public rights of way.   Because any customer may elect to provide their own electric services, FPL effectively must compete for an individual customer's business. As a practical matter, few customers provide their own service at the present time since FPL's cost of service is lower than the cost of self-generation for the vast majority of customers. Changing technology (particularly increasing efficiency of solar power generation), tax incentives, economic conditions, regulatory changes, increasing cost-competitiveness of rooftop solar and batteries and other factors could alter the favorable relative cost position that FPL currently enjoys; however, FPL seeks as a matter of strategy to ensure that it delivers superior value, in the form of comparatively low customer bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy.  In addition to self-generation by residential, commercial and industrial customers, FPL also faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale and industrial customers and from alternative energy sources. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial electric customers combined represented approximately 7%, 6% and 5%, respectively, of FPL's total operating revenues.  For the building of new steam and solar generating capacity of 75 MW or greater, the FPSC requires investor-owned electric utilities, including FPL, to issue a request for proposal (RFP) except when the FPSC determines that an exception from the RFP process is in the public interest. The RFP process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity. If a bidder has the most cost-effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and/or operating generating capacity of the type proposed, the investor-owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a PPA with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC approve the  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents    terms of the PPA and, if appropriate, provide the required authorization for the construction of the bidder's generating capacity.  FPL SOURCES OF GENERATION  At December\u00a031, 2022, FPL's resources for serving load consisted of approximately 33,195 MW of net generating capacity, of which 32,066 MW were from FPL-owned facilities and 1,129 MW were available through PPAs. FPL owned and operated 44 units with generating capacity of 24,236 MW that primarily use natural gas and 50 solar generation facilities with generating capacity totaling 3,611 MW. In addition, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated 4 nuclear units with net generating capacity totaling 3,502 MW (see Nuclear Operations below) and had joint ownership interests in 3 coal units located in Mississippi and Georgia it did not operate with net generating capacity totaling 717 MW. FPL intends to retire its share of 2 of these coal units in 2024 and together with a joint owner retire the remaining unit in 2028. See Note 7 \u2013 Jointly-Owned Electric Plants regarding the retirement of these plants. FPL also develops and constructs battery storage projects, which when combined with its solar projects, serve to enhance its ability to meet customer needs for a nearly firm generation source. At December\u00a031, 2022, FPL had 469 MW of battery storage capacity that delivers energy to the transmission system. FPL customer usage and operating revenues are typically higher during the summer months, largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in its service area. Occasionally, unusually cold temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in electricity usage for short periods of time.  Through 2025, FPL plans to add new solar generation with cost recovery mechanisms through base rates, a Solar Base Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) and SolarTogetherTM (a voluntary community solar program that gives FPL electric customers an opportunity to participate directly in the expansion of solar energy where participants pay a fixed monthly subscription charge and receive credits on their related monthly customer bill). FPL placed 745 MW of solar generating capacity in service in January\u00a02023 and is currently in the process of constructing an additional 447 MW and 1,639 MW of solar generating capacity, which is expected to be placed in service by mid-2023 and in 2024, respectively (see FPL Regulation \u2013 FPL Electric Rate Regulation \u2013 Base Rates \u2013 Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below).   Fuel Sources  FPL relies upon a mix of fuel sources for its generation facilities, the ability of some of its generation facilities to operate on both natural gas and low sulfur diesel, and on purchased power to maintain the flexibility to achieve a more economical fuel mix in order to respond to market and industry developments. See discussion of planned solar generation additions above.   *approximately 66% has dual fuel capability  Significant Fuel and Transportation Contracts. At December\u00a031, 2022, FPL had the following significant fuel and transportation contracts in place:  \u2022firm transportation contracts with nine different transportation suppliers for natural gas pipeline capacity for an aggregate maximum delivery quantity of 2,966,000 MMBtu/day with expiration dates through 2042 (see Note 15 \u2013 Contracts);  \u2022several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates through 2037; and \u2022short- and medium-term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of FPL's anticipated needs for natural gas, with the remainder of FPL's natural gas requirements being purchased in the spot market. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents     Nuclear Operations  At December\u00a031, 2022, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated the four nuclear units in Florida discussed below. FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time.

Approval of the additional 20 years of operations is pending.  NRC regulations require FPL to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. If the license renewals are approved by the NRC, FPL's plans provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be shut down in 2056 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No.\u00a02 commencing in 2063. If the NRC approves an additional 20 years of operations, FPL's plans provide for the dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 with decommissioning activities commencing in 2052 and 2053, respectively.  FPL's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through license expiration, as well as through any pending license extensions.  FPL ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING  FPL's Energy Marketing & Trading division (EMT) buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, low sulfur diesel, electricity and renewable energy credits (RECs) from certain FPL solar generation assets. EMT procures natural gas and low sulfur diesel for FPL's use in power generation and sells excess natural gas, low sulfur diesel and electricity. EMT also uses derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. Substantially all of the results of EMT's activities are passed through to customers in the fuel or capacity clauses. See Management's Discussion\u00a0\u2013 Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity and Note\u00a03.  FPL REGULATION  FPL's operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and other organizations, including, but not limited to, the following:  \u2022the FPSC, which has jurisdiction over retail rates, service area, issuances of securities, and planning, siting and construction of facilities, among other things; \u2022the FERC, which oversees the acquisition and disposition of electric generation, transmission and other facilities, transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce, proposals to build and operate interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy, among other things; \u2022the NERC, which, through its regional entities, establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards, subject to approval by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system blackouts; \u2022the NRC, which has jurisdiction over the operation of nuclear power plants through the issuance of operating licenses, rules, regulations and orders; and \u2022the EPA, which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in some cases delegating authority to state agencies. The EPA also works with industries and all levels of government, including federal and state governments, in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents    FPL Electric Rate Regulation  The FPSC sets rates at a level that is intended to allow the utility the opportunity to collect from retail customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to its cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. To accomplish this, the FPSC uses various ratemaking mechanisms, including, among other things, base rates and cost recovery clauses. Although FPL and Gulf Power Company merged effective January 1, 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate rate making entities until January 1, 2022 when new unified rates and tariffs became effective for the combined utility system (including the former Gulf Power Company service area). See Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below.  Base Rates. In general, the basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other costs, are recovered through base rates, which are designed to recover the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system. These basic costs include O&M expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a return on investment in assets used and useful in providing electric service (rate base). At the time base rates are established, the allowed rate of return on rate base approximates the FPSC's determination of the utility's estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which includes its costs for outstanding debt and an allowed return on common equity. The FPSC monitors the utility's actual regulatory ROE through a surveillance report that is filed monthly with the FPSC. The FPSC does not provide assurance that any regulatory ROE will be achieved. Base rates are determined in rate proceedings or through negotiated settlements of those proceedings. Proceedings can occur at the initiative of the utility or upon action by the FPSC. Existing base rates remain in effect until new base rates are approved by the FPSC.  Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 \u2013 In December 2021, the FPSC issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2021 rate agreement).  Key elements of the 2021 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2022 through at least December 2025, include, among other things, the following: \u2022New retail base rates and charges were established for the combined utility system (including the former Gulf Power Company service area) resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues: \u25e6$692 million beginning January 1, 2022, and \u25e6$560 million beginning January 1, 2023. \u2022In addition, FPL is eligible to receive, subject to conditions specified in the 2021 rate agreement, base rate increases associated with the addition of up to 894 MW annually of new solar generation through the SoBRA mechanism in each of 2024 and 2025, and may carry forward any unused MW in 2024 to 2025. FPL has agreed to an installed cost cap of $1,250 per kW and will be required to demonstrate that these proposed solar facilities are cost effective.  \u2022FPL's authorized regulatory ROE was 10.60%, with a range of 9.70% to 11.70%. However, in the event the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate was 2.49% or greater over a consecutive six-month period, FPL was authorized to increase the regulatory ROE to 10.80% with a range of 9.80% to 11.80%. During August 2022, this provision was triggered and effective September 1, 2022, FPL's authorized regulatory ROE and ROE range were increased. The revised authorized regulatory ROE will have only a minimal impact to base rates. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below 9.80%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above 11.80%, any party with standing may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates.  \u2022Subject to certain conditions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2021 rate agreement, up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, provided that in any year of the 2021 rate agreement FPL must amortize at least enough reserve amount to maintain its minimum authorized regulatory ROE and also may not amortize any reserve amount that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of its maximum authorized regulatory ROE. \u2022FPL is authorized to expand SolarTogether\u2122 by constructing an additional 1,788 MW of solar generation from 2022 through\u00a02025, such that the total capacity of SolarTogether\u2122 would be 3,278 MW.  \u2022Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kWh of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4 surcharge. See Note 1 \u2013 Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery. \u2022If federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the 2021 rate agreement, FPL will prospectively adjust base rates after a review by the FPSC. As a result of the enactment of the IRA (see NEER \u2013 Clean Energy and Other Operations \u2013 Clean Energy \u2013 Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects and Note 5), FPL's customers are expected to save approximately $400 million over the remaining term of the 2021 rate agreement which includes a $36 million one-time refund made in January 2023.  On February 8, 2023, the Florida Supreme Court heard oral argument on the appeal of the FPSC's final order regarding the 2021 rate agreement by Floridians Against Increased Rates, Inc. and, as a group, Florida Rising, Inc., Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Inc. and League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida. A ruling by the Florida Supreme Court is pending. See Note 1 \u2013 Rate Regulation.  Base Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021 \u2013 From January 2017 to December 2021, FPL operated under a base rate agreement (2016 rate agreement) that provided for, among other things, a regulatory ROE of 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60% and, subject to certain conditions, the right to reduce depreciation expense up to $1.25 billion (reserve),  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents    provided that in any year of the 2016 rate agreement FPL was required to amortize enough reserve to maintain an earned regulatory ROE within the range of 9.60% to 11.60%.  Cost Recovery Clauses. Cost recovery clauses are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through these clauses. Cost recovery clause costs are recovered through levelized monthly charges per kWh or kW, depending on the customer's rate class. These cost recovery clause charges are calculated annually based on estimated costs and estimated customer usage for the following year, plus or minus true-up adjustments to reflect the estimated over or under recovery of costs for the current and prior periods. An adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved during the course of a year to reflect revised estimates. FPL recovers costs from customers through the following clauses:  \u2022Fuel \u2013 primarily fuel costs, the most significant of the cost recovery clauses in terms of operating revenues (see Note 1 \u2013 Rate Regulation); \u2022Storm Protection Plan \u2013 costs associated with an FPSC-approved transmission and distribution storm protection plan, which includes costs for hardening of overhead transmission and distribution lines, undergrounding of certain distribution lines and vegetation management; \u2022Capacity \u2013 primarily certain costs associated with the acquisition of several electric generation facilities (see Note 1 \u2013 Rate Regulation) and capacity payments related to PPAs;  \u2022Energy Conservation \u2013 costs associated with implementing energy conservation programs; and \u2022Environmental \u2013 certain costs of complying with federal, state and local environmental regulations enacted after April 1993 and costs associated with certain of FPL's solar facilities placed in service prior to 2016.  The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. These costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when generation units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities.  FERC  The Federal Power Act grants the FERC exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, electric utilities must file for FERC acceptance and maintain tariffs and rate schedules which govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. Wholesale power sales tariffs on file at FERC may authorize sales at cost-based rates or, where the seller lacks market power, at market-based rates. The Federal Power Act also gives the FERC authority to certify and oversee an electric reliability organization with authority to establish and independently enforce mandatory reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk-power system. See NERC below. Electric utilities are subject to accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements administered by the FERC. The FERC also places certain limitations on transactions between electric utilities and their affiliates.  NERC  The NERC has been certified by the FERC as an electric reliability organization. The NERC's mandate is to ensure the reliability and security of the North American bulk-power system through the establishment and enforcement of reliability standards approved by FERC. The NERC's regional entities also enforce reliability standards approved by the FERC. FPL is subject to these reliability standards and incurs costs to ensure compliance with continually heightened requirements, and can incur significant penalties for failing to comply with them.  FPL Environmental Regulation  FPL is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. FPL expects to seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations.  FPL HUMAN CAPITAL  FPL had approximately 9,300 employees at December\u00a031, 2022, with approximately 31% of these employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). The collective bargaining agreements have approximately two- to three-year terms and expire between April 2024 and January 2025.    10 10 10  Table of Contents Table of Contents    NEER  NEER, comprised of NEE's competitive energy and rate-regulated transmission businesses, is a diversified clean energy business with a strategy that emphasizes the development, construction and operation of long-term contracted assets with a focus on clean energy. NEE reports NextEra Energy Resources and NEET, a rate-regulated transmission business, on a combined basis for segment reporting purposes, and the combined segment is referred to as NEER. The NEER segment currently owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets in the U.S. and Canada and also includes assets and investments in other businesses with a clean energy focus, such as battery storage and renewable fuels. NEER, with approximately 27,400 MW of total net generating capacity at December\u00a031, 2022, is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the U.S., including approximately 26,890 MW of net generating capacity across 40 states and 520 MW of net generating capacity in 4 Canadian provinces. At December\u00a031, 2022, NEER operates facilities, in which it has partial or full ownership interests, with a total generating capacity of approximately 33,800 MW. NEER produces the majority of its electricity from clean and renewable sources as described more fully below. In addition, NEER develops and constructs battery storage projects, which when combined with its renewable projects, serve to enhance its ability to meet customer needs for a nearly firm generation source, or as standalone facilities. NEER is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun based on 2022 MWh produced on a net generation basis, as well as a world leader in battery storage. The NEER segment also owns, develops, constructs and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities in North America. At December\u00a031, 2022, NEER's rate-regulated transmission facilities and the transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid are comprised of approximately 290 substations and 3,420 circuit miles of transmission lines.  NEER also engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities, including entering into financial and physical contracts. These contracts primarily include power and fuel commodities and their related products for the purpose of providing full energy and capacity requirements services, primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets, and offering customized power and fuel and related risk management services to wholesale customers, as well as to hedge the production from NEER's generation assets that is not sold under long-term power supply agreements. In addition, NEER participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production through operating and non-operating ownership interests, and in pipeline infrastructure construction, management and operations, through either wholly owned subsidiaries or noncontrolling or joint venture interests, hereafter referred to as the gas infrastructure business. NEER also hedges the expected output from its gas infrastructure production assets to protect against price movements.   NEP \u2013 NEP acquires, manages and owns contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. NEP's projects include energy projects contributed by or acquired from NextEra Energy Resources, or acquired from third parties, as well as ownership interests in contracted natural gas pipelines acquired from third parties. NEP from time to time also invests to repower or expand certain of its assets. NextEra Energy Resources' indirect limited partnership interest in NEP OpCo based on the number of outstanding NEP OpCo common units was approximately 53.8% at December\u00a031, 2022. NextEra Energy Resources accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accounts for its project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 \u2013 Basis of Presentation. At December\u00a031, 2022, NEP owned, or had a partial ownership interest in, a portfolio of wind, solar and solar plus battery storage projects with energy project capacity totaling approximately 9,345 MW and contracted natural gas pipelines, all located in the U.S. as further discussed in Clean Energy and Other Operations. NextEra Energy Resources operates essentially all of the energy projects in NEP's portfolio and its ownership interest in the portfolio's capacity was approximately 4,289 MW at December\u00a031, 2022.   CLEAN ENERGY AND OTHER OPERATIONS  NEER sells products associated with its generation facilities (energy, capacity, RECs and ancillary services) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities are located.

Information related to contracted generation assets at December\u00a031, 2022 was as follows: \u2022represented approximately 25,534 MW of total net generating capacity;  \u2022weighted-average remaining contract term of the power sales agreements, including the remaining life of the PTCs associated with repowered wind facilities, of approximately 15 years, based on forecasted contributions to earnings and forecasted amounts of electricity produced by the repowered wind facilities; and \u2022several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel for all nuclear units with expiration dates through 2033 (see Note\u00a015 \u2013 Contracts).  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents    NEER's merchant generation assets primarily consist of generation facilities that do not have long-term power sales agreements to sell their capacity and/or energy output and therefore require active marketing and hedging. Merchant generation assets at December\u00a031, 2022 represented approximately 1,878 MW of total net generating capacity, including 840 MW from nuclear generation and 1,032 MW from other peak generation facilities, and are primarily located in the Northeast region of the U.S. NEER utilizes swaps, options, futures and forwards to lock in pricing and manage the commodity price risk inherent in power sales and fuel purchases.  NEER Generation Assets Fuel/Technology Mix  NextEra Energy Resources utilized the following mix of fuel sources for generation facilities in which it has an ownership interest:    *Primarily natural gas  Wind Facilities  \u2022located in 22 states in the U.S. and 4 provinces in Canada; \u2022operated a total generating capacity of 23,380 MW at December\u00a031, 2022; \u2022ownership interests in a total net generating capacity of 18,891 MW at December\u00a031, 2022;  \u25e6essentially all MW are from contracted wind assets located primarily throughout Texas and the West and Midwest regions of the U.S. and Canada;  \u25e6added approximately 2,850 MW of new generating capacity and repowered wind generating capacity totaling 239 MW in the U.S. in 2022 and sold assets to NEP totaling approximately 431 MW (see Note 1 \u2013 Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests).  Solar Facilities  \u2022located in 30 states in the U.S.; \u2022operated photovoltaic and solar thermal facilities with a total generating capacity of 5,407 MW at December\u00a031, 2022; \u2022ownership interests in solar facilities with a total net generating capacity of 3,924 MW at December\u00a031, 2022; \u25e6essentially all MW are from contracted solar facilities located primarily throughout the West and South regions of the U.S.; \u25e6added approximately 887 MW of generating capacity in the U.S. in 2022 and sold assets to NEP and third parties totaling approximately 338 MW (see Note 1 \u2013 Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests).  Nuclear Facilities  At December\u00a031, 2022, NextEra Energy Resources was the sole owner of the two Point Beach nuclear units shown in the table below and was the largest joint owner of the Seabrook nuclear facility shown in the table below. NEER's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time. 14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents    FacilityLocationNet Generating Capacity(MW)PortfolioCategoryBeginning of Next ScheduledRefueling OutageOperating LicenseExpiration DateSeabrookNew Hampshire1,102(a)Merchant(b)April 20232050Point Beach Unit No. 1Wisconsin595Contracted(c)October 20232030(d)Point Beach Unit No. 2Wisconsin595Contracted(c)March 20232033(d) 1,102(a) Merchant(b) Contracted(c) 2030(d) Contracted(c) 2033(d) ______________________ (a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Excludes 147 MW operated by NEER but owned by non-affiliates.

(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2020, NEER filed an application with the NRC to renew both Point Beach operating licenses for an additional 20 years. License renewals are pending.  NEER is responsible for all nuclear unit operations and the ultimate decommissioning of the nuclear units, the cost of which is shared on a pro-rata basis by the joint owners with respect to the Seabrook unit. NRC regulations require plant owners to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. NEER's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which, based on existing regulations, are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through current license expiration, as well as through any pending license extensions.  NEER also maintains an approximately 70% interest in Duane Arnold, a nuclear facility located in Iowa that ceased operations in August 2020. NEER submitted a site-specific cost estimate and plan for decontamination and decommissioning to the NRC. All spent nuclear fuel housed onsite is in long-term dry storage until the DOE is able to take possession. NEER estimates that the cost of decommissioning Duane Arnold is fully funded and expects completion by approximately 2080.  Other Clean Energy  NEER's portfolio also includes assets and investments in other businesses with a clean energy focus, such as battery storage and renewable fuels. At December\u00a031, 2022, NEER had net ownership interests in approximately 1,208 MW of battery storage capacity. In October 2022, a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources entered into several agreements to acquire 100% of a portfolio of renewable energy projects from the owners of Energy Power Partners Fund I, L.P. and North American Sustainable Energy Fund, L.P. The portfolio primarily consists of 31 biogas projects, one of which is an operating renewable natural gas facility and the others of which are primarily operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities. The acquisition is expected to close in early 2023, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals including approvals from the FERC. See Note 6 \u2013 RNG Acquisition.  Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects  U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Pursuant to the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, wind and solar generation facilities are depreciated for tax purposes over a five-year period even though the useful life of such facilities is generally much longer than five years.  Owners of wind and solar facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended several times for wind (the previous PTC for solar expired in 2006). The IRA expanded the PTC to include solar generation facilities and extended the 100% PTC and the 30% ITC to wind and solar generation facilities that start construction before the later of 2034 or the end of the calendar year following the year in which greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. electric generation are reduced by 75% from 2022 levels. Accordingly, owners of wind and solar generation facilities placed in service in 2022 or later are eligible to claim a PTC (or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the facility during the first ten years of commercial operation. Alternatively, an ITC equal to 30% of the cost of the facility may be claimed in lieu of the PTC. A facility must also meet certain labor requirements to qualify for the 100% PTC or 30% ITC rate or construction must have started on the facility before January 29, 2023. In addition, the PTC is increased by 10% and the ITC rate is increased by 10 percentage points for facilities that satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirements. Retrofitted wind and solar generation facilities may qualify for a PTC or an ITC if the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the retrofitted facility\u2019s total fair value.  In addition, the IRA expanded the 30% ITC to include storage projects placed in service after 2022 (previously, such projects qualified only if they were connected to and charged by a renewable generation facility that claimed the ITC) as well as renewable natural gas facilities that are placed in service after 2022 and begin construction before 2025. The IRA created a PTC of $3/kilogram of green (low emission) hydrogen produced at a facility after 2022 and during the first ten years of commercial operation (or a 30% ITC in lieu of the PTC), provided that construction of the facility begins before 2033. These credits are also subject to certain other requirements. In addition, storage projects and hydrogen facilities claiming an ITC are eligible for a 10 percentage point increase in the ITC rate if the facilities satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirements. A wind or solar  15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents    project that provides electricity to a green hydrogen facility may qualify for the PTC or ITC and the hydrogen facility may separately qualify for its own PTC or ITC.  For taxable years beginning after 2022, renewable energy tax credits generated during the taxable year can be transferred to an unrelated transferee.  Other countries, including Canada, provide for incentives like feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy projects. The feed-in-tariffs promote renewable energy investments by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy producers, typically based on the cost of generation of each technology.  Other Operations  Gas Infrastructure Business \u2013 At December\u00a031, 2022, NextEra Energy Resources had ownership interests in natural gas pipelines, the most significant of which are discussed below, and in oil and gas shale formations located primarily in the Midwest and South regions of the U.S. MilesofPipelinePipelineLocation/RouteOwnershipTotal Net Capacity (per day)In-ServiceDatesTexas Pipelines(a)386South Texas51.8%(b)1.92 Bcf1960s \u2013 2015Sabal Trail(c)517Southwestern Alabama to Central Florida42.5%0.43 BcfJune 2017 \u2013 May 2020Florida Southeast Connection(c)169Central Florida to South Florida100%0.64 BcfJune 2017Central Penn Line(d)191Northeastern Pennsylvania to SoutheasternPennsylvania21.0%(b)0.39 BcfOctober 2018 \u2013 October 2021 Texas Pipelines(a) (b) 1960s \u2013 2015 Sabal Trail(c) June 2017 \u2013 May 2020 Florida Southeast Connection(c) Central Penn Line(d) (b) 0.39 Bcf October 2018 \u2013 October 2021 ______________________ (a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A NEP portfolio of six natural gas pipelines, of which a third party owns a 10% interest in a 120-mile pipeline with a daily capacity of approximately 2.3 Bcf.

Customer Supply and Proprietary Power and Gas Trading \u2013 NEER provides commodities-related products to customers, engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities and includes the operations of a retail electricity provider. Through NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary PMI, NEER: \u2022manages risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices and optimizes the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure production assets through the use of swaps, options, futures and forwards; \u2022sells output from NEER's plants that is not sold under long-term contracts and procures fuel for use by NEER's generation fleet; \u2022provides full energy and capacity requirements to customers; and \u2022markets and trades energy-related commodity products, including power, fuel, renewable attributes and carbon offsets, as well as marketing and trading services to customers.  16 16 16 Table of Contents Table of Contents    MARKETS AND COMPETITION  Electricity markets in the U.S. and Canada are regional and diverse in character. All are extensively regulated, and competition in these markets is shaped and constrained by regulation. The nature of the products offered varies based on the specifics of regulation in each region. Generally, in addition to the natural constraints on pricing freedom presented by competition, NEER may also face specific constraints in the form of price caps, or maximum allowed prices, for certain products. NEER's ability to sell the output of its generation facilities may also be constrained by available transmission capacity, which can vary from time to time and can have a significant impact on pricing.  The degree and nature of competition is different in wholesale markets than in retail markets. A majority of NEER's revenues are derived from sales of energy, capacity, credits and ancillary products under long-term PPAs to customers located in wholesale electricity markets. Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. NEER primarily competes on the basis of price, but believes the green attributes of NEER's generation assets, its track record of completing projects on schedule, its creditworthiness and its ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solutions to wholesale customers are competitive advantages. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NEER competes with depending on the market. In wholesale markets, customers' needs are met through a variety of means, including long-term bilateral contracts, standardized bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and risk management services.  In general, U.S. and Canadian electricity markets encompass three classes of services: energy and related energy credits, capacity and ancillary services. Energy services relate to the physical delivery of power; capacity services relate to the availability of MW capacity of a power generation asset; and ancillary services are other services that relate to power generation assets, such as load regulation and spinning and non-spinning reserves. The exact nature of these classes of services is defined in part by regional tariffs. Not all regions have a capacity services class, and the specific definitions of ancillary services vary from region to region.  RTOs and ISOs exist throughout much of North America to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic areas and to run markets. NEER operates in all RTO and ISO jurisdictions. At December\u00a031, 2022, NEER also had generation facilities with a total net generating capacity of approximately 6,581 MW that fall within reliability regions that are not under the jurisdiction of an established RTO or ISO, including 4,430 MW within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and 2,109 MW within the SERC Reliability Corporation. Although each RTO and ISO may have differing objectives and structures, some benefits of these entities include regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing larger wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity providers. NEER has operations that fall within the following RTOs and ISOs: 17 17 17 Table of Contents Table of Contents      NEER competes in different regions to differing degrees, but in general it seeks to enter into long-term bilateral contracts for the full output of its generation facilities. At December\u00a031, 2022, approximately 93% of NEER's net generating capacity was committed under long-term contracts. Where long-term contracts are not in effect, NEER sells the output of its facilities into daily spot markets. In such cases, NEER will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contracts, typically of less than three years duration, to hedge the price risk associated with selling into a daily spot market. Such bilateral contracts, which may be hedges either for physical delivery or for financial (pricing) offset, serve to protect a portion of the revenue that NEER expects to derive from the associated generation facility. Contracts that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of a generation facility but are not recorded as hedges under GAAP are referred to as \u201cnon-qualifying hedges\u201d for adjusted earnings purposes. See Management's Discussion \u2013 Overview \u2013 Adjusted Earnings.  Certain facilities within the NEER wind and solar generation portfolio produce RECs and other environmental attributes which are typically sold along with the energy from the plants under long-term contracts, or may be sold separately from wind and solar generation not sold under long-term contracts. The purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting rights and ownership of the environmental attributes.  While the majority of NEER's revenue is derived from the output of its generation facilities, NEER is also an active competitor in several regions in the wholesale full requirements business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel products and services to a variety of customers. In the full requirements service, typically, the supplier agrees to meet the customer's needs for a full range of products for every hour of the day, at a fixed price, for a predetermined period of time, thereby assuming the risk of fluctuations in the customer's volume requirements.  Expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NEER. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient facilities that can sell power in competitive markets. NEER seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its facilities.  18 18 18 Table of Contents Table of Contents    NEER REGULATION  The energy markets in which NEER operates are subject to domestic and foreign regulation, as the case may be, including local, state and federal regulation, and other specific rules.  At December\u00a031, 2022, essentially all of NEER's generation facilities located in the U.S. have received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. Exempt wholesale generators own or operate a facility exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers. They are barred from selling electricity directly to retail customers. While projects with exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various restrictions, each project must still comply with other federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, those regarding siting, construction, operation, licensing, pollution abatement and other environmental laws.  Additionally, most of the NEER facilities located in the U.S. are subject to FERC regulations and market rules and the NERC's mandatory reliability standards, all of its facilities are subject to environmental laws and the EPA's environmental regulations, and its nuclear facilities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. See FPL \u2013 FPL Regulation for additional discussion of FERC, NERC, NRC and EPA regulations. Rates of NEER's rate-regulated transmission businesses are set by regulatory bodies as noted in Clean Energy and Other Operations \u2013 Other Operations \u2013 Rate-Regulated Transmission. With the exception of facilities located in ERCOT, the FERC has jurisdiction over various aspects of NEER's business in the U.S., including the oversight and investigation of competitive wholesale energy markets, regulation of the transmission and sale of natural gas, and oversight of environmental matters related to natural gas projects and major electricity policy initiatives. The PUCT has jurisdiction, including the regulation of rates and services, oversight of competitive markets, and enforcement of statutes and rules, over NEER facilities located in ERCOT.  Certain entities within the NEER segment and their affiliates are also subject to federal and provincial or regional regulations in Canada related to energy operations, energy markets and environmental standards. In Canada, activities related to owning and operating wind and solar projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are regulated at the provincial level. In Ontario, for example, electric generation facilities must be licensed by the OEB and may also be required to complete registrations and maintain market participant status with the IESO, in which case they must agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions of the market rules for the Ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC.   In addition, NEER is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. In order to better anticipate potential regulatory changes, NEER continues to actively evaluate and participate in regional market redesigns of existing operating rules for the integration of renewable energy resources and for the purchase and sale of energy commodities.  NEER HUMAN CAPITAL  NEER had approximately 5,900 employees at December\u00a031, 2022. NEER has collective bargaining agreements with the IBEW, the Utility Workers Union of America and the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America, which collectively represent approximately 8% of NEER's employees. The collective bargaining agreements have approximately two- to four-year terms and expire between June 2024 and December 2025.   NEE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  NEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water quality and usage, waste management, wildlife protection and historical resources, for the siting, construction and ongoing operations of their facilities. The U.S. government and certain states and regions, as well as the Government of Canada and its provinces, have taken and continue to take certain actions, such as proposing and finalizing regulations or setting targets or goals, regarding the regulation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation. The environmental laws in the U.S., including, among others, the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), provide for the protection of numerous species, including endangered species and/or their habitats, migratory birds, bats and eagles. In 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services proposed new rules that would add two bat species to the endangered species list. If such rules are enacted, certain of NEER\u2019s existing and new wind generation facilities would incur additional costs to comply with the proposed regulations. The environmental laws in Canada, including, among others, the Species at Risk Act, provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are endangered or threatened and the management of species of special concern. Complying with these environmental laws and regulations could result in, among other things, changes in the design and operation of existing facilities and changes or delays in the location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. Failure to comply could result in fines, penalties, criminal sanctions or injunctions. NEE's rate-regulated subsidiaries expect to seek recovery for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations, which recovery for FPL would be through the environmental clause.  In April 2022, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to implement an eagle management plan requiring, among other things, certain existing or in development wind sites to apply for eagle \"take\" permits under the BGEPA. Under the agreement, the DOJ will not prosecute NextEra Energy Resources or its  19 19 19 Table of Contents Table of Contents    affiliates for any eagle fatalities that have previously occurred, or may occur, at wind facilities operated by NextEra Energy Resources nationwide prior to the earlier of the date such facility obtains a permit or the date that is up to ten years following court approval of the agreement, provided that the NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary remains in compliance with its commitments under the agreement. NextEra Energy Resources voluntarily undertakes adaptive management practices designed to avoid and minimize eagle impacts and continues to believe that the criminal liability provisions of these laws were intended only to apply to hunting, poaching and other intentional activities, and do not apply to accidental collisions with wind turbines or other manufactured items, such as airplanes, locomotives, automobiles and buildings.  WEBSITE ACCESS TO SEC FILINGS  NEE and FPL make their SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on NEE's internet website, www.nexteraenergy.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
