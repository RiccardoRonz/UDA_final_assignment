Our Enterprise Stewardship Program Committee, a committee of our management team, works in partnership with all segments, regions, and functions to facilitate alignment with ongoing ESG efforts, which will include gathering input from internal and external stakeholders to help inform our ESG strategy and focus areas.   Our current ESG focus areas include:  \u2022Expanding access to healthcare: We aim to expand access to healthcare for underserved populations around the world. Our technology enables caregivers to bring advanced diagnostics and treatments to remote parts of the world where access to hospitals and medical equipment is limited.  \u2022Promoting inclusion and diversity across the enterprise: We are committed to building a more inclusive workplace and diverse workforce. We believe in the value of each person\u2019s unique identity, background, and experiences, and we are committed to fostering an inclusive culture in which all employees feel empowered to do their best work because they feel accepted, respected, and that they belong.  \u2022Mitigating our climate impact and improving resiliency: We are working to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and have set goals to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. In alignment with this goal, we have signed up to the Science Based Targets initiative and are part of the UN-backed \u201cRace to Zero,\u201d which commits us to reducing emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, which was adopted under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  \u2022Advancing the circular economy and environmental design: We seek to support the transition to a more circular economy. For more than 20 years, GE HealthCare\u2019s GoldSeal program has reduced medical imaging equipment waste by promoting and enabling the reuse of equipment and parts from de-installed imaging and ultrasound systems. Machines are refurbished or dismantled, harvested, and recycled, reducing waste and contributing to a circular economy. Of the equipment recovered, approximately 95% of the materials are reused or recycled.  \u2022Protecting patient data and cybersecurity: We provide cybersecurity products, solutions, and services. Cybersecurity is embedded within the GE HealthCare culture, and we are committed to protecting our business and customers by: safeguarding a secure enterprise and continuously advancing our internal cybersecurity capabilities; offering secure products and solutions through design, development, and the product lifecycle; providing secure service delivery with industry-leading technology, processes, and risk mitigation approaches; and providing a portfolio of cyber-managed services to assist health delivery organizations with securing their operations.   Our focus on these five areas builds upon our long-standing commitments to innovation, product quality, and integrity. As an independent company, we are integrating ESG more deeply into the core of our business strategy and culture.    11 11 11   SALES AND DISTRIBUTION MODEL  GE HealthCare deploys a global multi-channel commercial model consisting of 10,000 sales professionals and a network of approximately 5,200 indirect third-party partners. Our reach into top hospitals and health systems is evidenced by our long-standing collaborations with leading institutions around the world. Our commercial model is organized according to the needs of our customers and includes global and regional marketing, regional inside sales teams, field-based sales teams, and sales agents and distributors. Our equipment sales representatives partner closely with their service sales counterparts to position both equipment contracts and long-term maintenance agreements along with system upgrades and SaaS agreements. We complement our direct and indirect sales channels with end-to-end virtual sales teams. Our direct and indirect channel mix helps us expand our market coverage, increase customer satisfaction, and win more business in broad geographies and emerging markets. In developed markets, we supplement our commercial model with strategic account executive and collaboration teams who bring the depth and breadth of our overall portfolio to the senior leadership of our top customers to deliver long-term commercial collaborations, which can be tied to specific outcomes.   GLOBAL INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN, SOURCING, AND LOGISTICS   Our sourcing, production, and distribution network is managed globally while our products are manufactured at and distributed by facilities serving specific regions. We believe our global scale, complemented by local focus, allows us to provide our customers with improved supply chain security, reduced costs, and compliance with regional or national trade and marketing requirements. We have manufacturing, assembly, and pharmaceutical production in 43 facilities across 17 countries. We use globally managed and coordinated quality assurance programs across our manufacturing and ISO-certified distribution facilities, and we regularly inspect and audit our sites. We hold our suppliers to the same rigorous operating standards.  REGULATION   The development, manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products are subject to stringent government regulation globally. We commit extensive resources to maintain compliance with these regulations.   The United States, European Union (\"EU\"), and China are our most significant regions based on revenue and the regulatory landscape within these regions. Sales of medical devices and pharmaceuticals outside of these regions are subject to requirements that vary from country to country. Our ability to market and sell our products globally depends upon our compliance with the laws and regulations in each jurisdiction. This requires, among other things, receiving specific marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities, and maintaining our Quality Management System, which is compliant with the applicable local regulatory requirements, and ISO 13485 certification that is recognized by many regulators. Complying with requirements imposed on our products and business is an ongoing process as we introduce additional products and/or product modifications and seek to comply with changing legal and regulatory requirements. The time required to obtain authorization to market and sell products varies by country. The ability to comply with global post-market requirements requires extensive and ongoing resources.   The International Medical Device Regulators Forum, which includes a number of country regulators, has implemented a global approach to auditing medical device manufacturers. The Medical Device Single Audit Program (\"MDSAP\") provides for a single annual audit of a medical device manufacturer by a MDSAP-recognized auditing organization to satisfy the requirements of ISO 13485 and the regulatory requirements of the authorities that participate in MDSAP (currently the United States (\"U.S.\")), Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Japan). While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") accepts MDSAP audit reports as a substitute for routine agency inspections, it considers the following types of inspections to fall outside the scope of MDSAP: for-cause or compliance follow-up inspections; pre-approval or post-approval inspections; and inspections to assess compliance with Electronic Product and Radiation Control regulations, which apply to Molecular Imaging, X-ray, Women\u2019s Health, Interventional, and Surgery products.   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  Food and Drug Law Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\"), we must comply with regulations governing the design, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, import/export, sale, servicing, and marketing of medical products, including medical devices and pharmaceuticals. U.S. FDA product approvals and clearances may be withdrawn or suspended if compliance with regulations is not maintained or if product issues are discovered. Some of our products are also subject to the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act and the Electronic Product and Radiation Control Regulations, administered by the FDA, which imposes performance standards, record keeping, reporting, product testing, and product labeling requirements on radiation-emitting electronic products, such as X-ray devices. We must also comply with the Mammography Quality Standards Act for our mammography products. Further, clinical studies of medical devices and pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation and inspection. In addition, we are subject to applicable laws and regulations of state and local authorities.    12 12 12   Devices The FDCA classifies medical devices into three classes based on risk, including Class I (lowest risk), Class II (moderate risk), and Class III (highest risk), with more stringent regulatory requirements applicable to higher-risk devices. Commercial sales of our Class II (except for Class II exempt devices) and Class III medical devices in the U.S. must be preceded by either a pre-market notification filing pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA for Class II or the granting of a premarket approval for Class III. The development of a medical device typically requires extensive non-clinical testing and, for some of our devices, clinical testing involving human subjects.   For all our medical devices, we must comply with FDA\u2019s requirements governing, among other things, device site registration and listing, labeling, post-market record keeping and reporting, and the Quality System Regulation. These requirements are detailed, comprehensive, and require extensive investment and resources to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements.   Pharmaceutical Products Our pharmaceutical products are subject to FDA\u2019s pre-market approval process. The pharmaceutical product development and approval process typically begins with extensive pre-clinical R&D, followed by approval of an Investigational New Drug (\"IND\"), and then, upon successful completion of several phases of clinical trials, the filing and request for FDA approval of a New Drug Application (\"NDA\"). We also are subject to FDA\u2019s requirements, including drug establishment registration and listing, labeling and advertising, and current Good Manufacturing Practice (\"cGMP\") regulations, which set forth minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing pharmaceutical products. Post-approval, we must maintain and submit to the FDA reports of product quality defects and adverse events. FDA\u2019s generic drug program requires filing of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\"ANDA\") for a generic drug application that does not include preclinical or clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness, but must demonstrate equivalency to the innovator drug.   EUROPEAN UNION.  Devices There is no pre-market approval of medical devices in the EU. All new medical devices placed on the market or put into service in the EU must be compliant with and meet the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation, which was implemented on May 26, 2021. Devices that conform to these requirements can be affixed with a CE marking and commercialized throughout the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") and in Switzerland. Prior to affixing a CE marking, manufacturers must demonstrate that their products comply with minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality, through a conformity assessment procedure that depends on the product\u2019s classification. The classification of a medical device is determined by its intended purpose. Devices are classified from lowest to highest, as either Class I, IIa, IIb, or III. Classification is dependent on a variety of factors, including duration of use, whether the device is invasive or non-invasive, and whether the device is considered \u201cactive.\u201d The competent authorities of the EU countries are responsible for regulating clinical investigations of medical devices and post-market surveillance of devices once they are placed on the market.   Pharmaceutical Products Our pharmaceutical products are regulated by the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d), or the national competent authorities of the EU/EEA countries where our products are marketed. The EMA, acting through the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (\u201cCHMP\u201d), is responsible for the scientific evaluation of pharmaceutical products developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU and submitted for assessment through the EU centralized procedure. If the CHMP concludes that all requirements for quality, safety, and efficacy are met, it issues a positive opinion that the EMA forwards to the European Commission, which takes the final decision on the granting of a marketing authorization.   CHINA. We must comply with medical device and pharmaceutical product laws and regulations and standards governing the design, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, import/export, sale, servicing, and advertising and promotion of our products in China. The chief pharmaceutical product and medical device regulator is the National Medical Products Administration (\u201cNMPA\u201d), which enforces these laws and has the power to issue fines, seize products, withdraw or suspend an approval or a registration for serious non-compliances, and refer cases for criminal prosecution. These national laws and regulations are also supplemented by provincial and other local-level rules and enforcement policies.  Devices Medical devices are strictly regulated by the NMPA and various provincial, city, and county regulators and are classified into three risk-based classes from lowest to highest, Class I, II, and III. Approved products are subject to post-market requirements for reporting adverse events and recalls, as well as regular risk assessments of devices and potentially re-evaluation reports of the safety and effectiveness of the device based on more significant safety signals.   13 13 13   In addition to product licenses, manufacturing and distribution facilities that handle Class II and III devices require licenses or notifications and must comply with cGMP requirements and good supply practices. The NMPA regularly conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities in China (as part of a pre-market submission review, routine or for-cause inspections, or unannounced inspections) as well as periodic inspections of overseas manufacturers for compliance with China medical device cGMP requirements. The NMPA inspects distributors and user facilities and conducts annual national and provincial sampling inspections and testing to ensure compliance with labeling, licensing, mandatory standards, and other related requirements. In addition, the NMPA conducts regular and for-cause good clinical practice audits of clinical sites that provide data and clinical trial reports for product registration.   Pharmaceutical Products Our pharmaceutical products are strictly regulated by the NMPA and various provincial, city, and county regulators. Significant changes were recently made to the China Drug Administration Law with more to follow regarding new regulatory requirements and technical guidelines. All our pharmaceutical products require pre-market approval from the NMPA before they can be marketed in China, and those marketing applications must be supported by clinical data, which typically comes from a multi-phase study in China or by relying on clinical data generated abroad that meets the NMPA\u2019s requirements.   DATA PRIVACY LAWS. Due to our extensive global footprint and handling of personal data as both a data controller (on our own behalf) and data processor (on behalf of third parties, primarily customers), we are also subject to an extensive collection of global laws and regulations protecting the privacy, security and integrity of the personal data, sensitive personal data, and patient health information that we create, receive, use, and maintain as a business. Among the most relevant and material to our business, based on the volume and sensitivity of the data at issue, are: the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information and Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively \u201cHIPAA\u201d); the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (\u201cGDPR\u201d), similar U.K. legislation resulting from the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018 (\u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d), and other EU country-level laws; the Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoias (\u201cBrazil LGPD\u201d); and the various laws and accompanying regulations in China governing data privacy and cybersecurity (e.g., the Cybersecurity Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Personal Information Protection Law (\"China PIPL\")). In addition, there are also various US state-level laws (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act), country regional laws, and proposed legislation that we monitor for applicability and impact to our business. These laws present a continuing challenge to businesses to structure their data collection, storage, use, and cross-border transmission in a compliant manner.  Many of these laws impose a significant compliance burden on organizations within their scope and failure to comply can result in a variety of sanctions, including administrative fines for the most serious compliance failures up to 4-5% of a company\u2019s total annual revenue of the preceding fiscal year (e.g., GDPR, U.K. GDPR, China PIPL). While there have been some recent enforcement actions by EU country-level data protection authorities resulting in substantial fines pursuant to GDPR, there remains uncertainty as to how data protection authorities throughout the rest of the globe will choose to interpret and enforce violations of applicable privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations (e.g., Brazil LGPD, China PIPL). Furthermore, these laws and regulations are continuously evolving, and further clarification in the form of implementing rules, guidelines and related guidance from the data protection authorities is necessary to paint a full picture of the compliance obligations imposed on businesses within their scope. To that end, while we are continuously monitoring the legal and regulatory environment, we cannot fully predict what effect, if any, clarification or changes to these laws and regulations may have on our business in the future.   REGULATION ON ADVERTISING, MARKETING, AND PROMOTION.  The advertising, marketing, and promotion of our products must be truthful and non-misleading, consistent with our regulatory clearances and approvals, and supported by adequate and reasonable scientific data. We may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our regulatory clearances or approvals or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. With limited exceptions, we may not market, promote, or sell regulated products prior to health authority clearance or approval. For our pharmaceutical products, health authorities regulate labeling and advertising. For our device products, health authorities regulate the labeling and, for certain devices, advertising in coordination with other enforcement agencies. A failure to comply with these regulations could expose the Company to legal liability, such as enforcement actions, investigations by a governmental authority, civil fines or criminal actions, lawsuits brought by competitors or company whistleblowers, or other actions. We must also comply with advertising, marketing, and promotion rules in all countries in which we market our products.   GLOBAL HEALTHCARE COMPLIANCE.   The marketing, promotion, and sale of medical devices, drugs, and services are regulated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and comparable U.S. state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of the delivery of healthcare items and services, representing government\u2019s interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare. Similar regulations are imposed in many global markets in which we do business. Industry trade associations (such as AdvaMed and MedTech) increasingly provide guidance on, and compliance with, applicable laws and regulations.    14 14 14   U.S. federal healthcare laws apply when we or our customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals, and healthcare fraud and abuse. Similar state false claims, anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and insurance laws also apply to state-funded Medicaid and other healthcare programs and private third-party payers. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties and expose us to civil liability and risk of further enforcement action under the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute (\"AKS\"), the False Claims Act (\"FCA\"), or other healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-cleared and -approved devices and drugs reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the \"Sunshine Act\"), which requires us to annually track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians and other healthcare professionals or U.S. teaching hospitals.   The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies from making corrupt payments to or otherwise engaging in bribery of governmental officials. These laws apply to many of our customer interactions, as healthcare professionals in other countries are often considered government officials, and in some cases lay out requirements of how to operationalize compliance with the legal requirements. Failure to comply with these laws may expose us to criminal and civil enforcement actions, monetary fines and penalties, and reputational harm.   Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to coverage or reimbursement amounts for our products by administrators of these systems, could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. Further, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the United States is implementing value-based payment methodologies and seeking to create alternative payment models, such as bundled payments, to continue to drive improved value.
