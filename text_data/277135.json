Grainger, Inc., incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, is a broad line, distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America (N.A.), Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). In this report, the words \u201cGrainger\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.  For financial information regarding the Company, see the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.  The Grainger Edge Grainger's strategic framework, \u201cThe Grainger Edge,\u201d uniquely defines the Company by asserting why it exists, how it serves customers and how team members work together to achieve its objectives. Grainger\u2019s purpose is We Keep the World Working\u00ae, which in turn allows customers to focus on the core of their businesses and do what they do best.   This framework also outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors expected from Grainger\u2019s team members in working with each other and the Company's customers, suppliers and communities as Grainger executes its strategy and creates value for shareholders. For further information on the Company's principles, see below \"Workplace Practices and Policies.\"  General Grainger's two reportable segments are High-Touch Solutions N.A. and Endless Assortment. These reportable segments align with Grainger's go-to-market strategies and bifurcated business models of high-touch solutions and endless assortment. For further segment information, see Part II, Item 7: Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.  Below is a description of Grainger\u2019s reportable segments and other businesses.   High-Touch Solutions N.A.  The Company's High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment provides value-added MRO solutions that are rooted in deep product knowledge and customer expertise. The high-touch solutions model serves customers with complex buying needs. This segment includes the Grainger-branded businesses in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.  Endless Assortment  The Company\u2019s Endless Assortment segment provides a streamlined and transparent online platform with one-stop shopping for millions of products. The Endless Assortment segment includes the Company\u2019s Zoro Tools, Inc. (Zoro) and MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (MonotaRO) online channels which operate predominately in the U.S. and Japan.  Other Other businesses is primarily comprised of the Company's Cromwell business in the U.K. and a wholly owned captive insurance entity. These businesses individually and in the aggregate do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment.         4 4 4    Business Models Competing with both high-touch solutions and endless assortment business models allows Grainger to leverage its scale and advantaged supply chain to meet the changing needs of its customers. The following provides a high-level view of the Company's business models:         5 5 5    Customers The Company uses a combination of its two business models to serve its more than 4.5 million customers worldwide which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations. Grainger\u2019s customers range from smaller businesses to large corporations, government entities and other institutions, representing a broad collection of industries, including, but not limited to commercial, healthcare, and manufacturing. No single end customer accounted for more than 4% of total sales for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022.   In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, customers are typically mid-size and large businesses with complex purchasing operations and processes. Many customers served in this segment expect product and service depth and are focused on total cost of procurement. Customers in this segment utilize sophisticated electronic purchasing platforms that communicate directly with Grainger.com through eProcurement technology. Sales and service representatives drive relationships with customers by helping select the right products and reducing costs by utilizing Grainger as a consistent source of supply. KeepStock\u00ae, Grainger's inventory management solution, serves customers on site, offering valuable insights to drive efficiencies and cost savings. The North American Customer Service Centers handle customer interactions for the region via phone, email, eCommerce portals and online chat.   In the Endless Assortment segment, customers are typically smaller and mid-size businesses with less complex purchasing operations and processes. Customers served in this segment have straight-forward product and service needs. Additionally, MonotaRO continues to attract and retain large enterprise customers. Customers purchasing through the endless assortment platforms are focused on transparent pricing and an easy-to-navigate procurement process. MonotaRO and Zoro offer an innovative customer experience by allowing customers to quickly find competitively priced products through intuitive business-focused eCommerce platforms with intelligent analytic capabilities.  Products and Services Grainger\u2019s product offering is grouped under several broad categories, including safety and security, material handling and storage, pumps and plumbing equipment, cleaning and maintenance, metalworking and hand tools. Products are regularly added and removed from Grainger's product lines based on customer demand, market research, suppliers' recommendations and other factors. No single product category comprised more than 20% of the Company's sales for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022.  In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, Grainger.com provides real-time price and product availability, detailed product information and features, such as product search and compare capabilities. The high-touch solutions businesses offer more than 2 million products and several services, such as technical support and inventory management.  In the Endless Assortment segment, Grainger offers an expansive product assortment and a broad, extensive product range that contains millions of products including those outside of traditional industrial MRO categories. Zoro offers more than 11 million products and MonotaRO provides access to more than 20 million products, primarily through its websites and catalogs. The endless assortment businesses continue to enhance assortment by strategically adding products and expanding the offer of third party held products.  Distribution and Sources of Supply In the large and fragmented MRO industry, Grainger holds an advantaged position with its supply chain  infrastructure and a broad in-stock product offering. More than 5,000 suppliers worldwide provide Grainger businesses with more than 1.4 million products stocked in Distribution Centers (DCs) and branches globally. No single supplier comprised more than 5% of Grainger's total purchases for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022.   In the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, DCs are the primary order fulfillment channel, mainly through direct shipments to customers. Automation in the DCs allows orders to ship complete with next-day delivery and also replenish branches that provide same-day availability to customers. Grainger\u2019s North American distribution network supplies inventory planning and management, transportation and distribution services to all Grainger businesses in the North American region. Branches serve the immediate needs of customers by allowing them to directly pick up items and leverage branch staff for their technical product expertise and search-and-select support. Additionally,  6 6 6   Grainger offers comprehensive inventory management through its KeepStock\u00ae program that includes vendor-managed inventory, customer-managed inventory and onsite vending machines.  In the Endless Assortment segment, orders are placed primarily through online channels. Zoro leverages the High-Touch Solution N.A.'s DC network and third-party drop shipments to deliver seamless service and product fulfillment to customers. MonotaRO fulfills customer orders through local DCs and third-party drop shipments.  For further information on the Company\u2019s properties, see Part I, Item 2: Properties of this Form 10-K.  Trademarks and Service Marks  Grainger conducts business under various trademarks and service marks. Approximately 20% of 2022 sales were private label MRO items bearing Grainger\u2019s registered trademarks, including DAYTON\u00ae, SPEEDAIRE\u00ae, AIR HANDLER\u00ae, TOUGH GUY\u00ae, WESTWARD\u00ae, CONDOR\u00ae and LUMAPRO\u00ae. Grainger also provides a suite of inventory services to its customers under the KEEPSTOCK\u00ae brand, which is a registered service mark. Grainger has taken steps to protect these service marks and trademarks against infringement and believes they will remain available for future use in its business.  Seasonality Grainger sells products that may have seasonal demand fluctuations during the winter or summer seasons or during periods of natural disasters. However, historical seasonality impacts have not been material to Grainger\u2019s operating results.  Competition Grainger faces competition from a variety of competitors, including manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, retailers and internet-based businesses. Also, competitors vary by size, from large broad line distributors and eCommerce retailers to small local and regional competitors. Grainger differentiates itself by providing local product availability, a broad product line, sales and service representatives and advanced electronic and eCommerce technology. Grainger also offers other services, such as inventory management and technical support.   Government Regulations Grainger\u2019s business is subject to a wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where Grainger operates. In addition to Grainger\u2019s U.S. based operations, which in 2022 generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico and the U.K., and through its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan. Compliance with these laws, regulations and standards requires the dedication of time and effort of team members as well as financial resources. In 2022, compliance with the applicable laws, regulations and standards did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact Grainger.  Human Capital The Company strongly believes that its corporate culture must be aligned with its business strategy and aspiration to create value. To that end, Grainger's Board of Directors and senior management are actively involved in cultivating Grainger\u2019s culture. The Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees the Company's human capital management programs and policies and routinely provides updates to the Board.    Grainger believes that a purpose-driven culture is an asset that creates a sustainable, competitive advantage for the Company. Building on its strong foundation while evolving a framework to address the future is critical to Grainger\u2019s continued success. Grainger has been consistently recognized for its commitment to its culture, diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and employee engagement.  Team Member Profile As of December 31, 2022, Grainger had more than 26,000 team members worldwide, of whom approximately 23,000 were full-time and 3,000 were part-time or temporary. Approximately 86% of these team members resided in  7 7 7   North America, 8% in Asia and 6% in Europe. Grainger has not experienced any major work stoppages and considers team member relations to be good.   Workplace Practices and Policies The Company has in place a strategic framework, The Grainger Edge, which outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors expected from Grainger\u2019s team members in working with each other and the Company's customers, suppliers and communities. This framework helps the Company execute its strategy and create value for shareholders.  The Grainger Edge principles also guide the Company\u2019s actions supporting health and safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, and team member experience, including talent acquisition and team member retention, development and compensation and benefits. The Grainger Edge principles are:  \u2022Start with the Customer\u2022Win as One Team\u2022Embrace Curiosity\u2022Invest in our Success\u2022Act with Intent\u2022Do the Right Thing\u2022Compete with Urgency \u2022Start with the Customer \u2022Win as One Team \u2022Embrace Curiosity \u2022Invest in our Success \u2022Act with Intent \u2022Do the Right Thing \u2022Compete with Urgency  Grainger\u2019s purpose-driven culture and principles help the Company attract, retain, motivate and develop its workforce and drive team member engagement. The Company believes an engaged workforce leads to a more innovative, productive and profitable company and measures team member engagement on an ongoing basis. The results from engagement surveys are used to inform programs and processes designed and implemented to enhance the inclusive culture Grainger aspires to achieve.   Health and Safety Grainger strives to provide a safe work environment and ensuring team members are properly prepared to perform the many tasks required to support customers. The Company\u2019s Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) program is designed to integrate EHS into Grainger\u2019s business operations and comply with applicable regulations. To that end, the Company requires each of its locations to perform regular safety audits to confirm proper safety policies, programs, procedures and training are in place and operating effectively.  The Company is focused on promoting a culture of safety and education. Operational team members must complete routine training to fully understand the expectation of behaviors defined by the Company\u2019s global EHS policy. Managing and reducing risks at DCs and other facilities remain a core objective and injury rates continue to be low. In 2022, the Company\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Total Recordable Incident Rate in the U.S. was 1.3 and the Company\u2019s Lost Time Incident Rate in the U.S. was 0.4 based upon the number of incidents per 100 team members (or per 200,000 work hours).   Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Grainger believes a diverse talent pool is essential to live its principles, foster innovation, build high-performing teams and drive business results. The Company understands that future business success requires a mix of current and new skill sets, multiple experiences, and a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives, and strives to reflect this priority in its hiring, retention and promotion practices. The Company aspires to increasingly promote a welcoming, inclusive culture that values all people \u2013 regardless of sex, gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender expression or experiences \u2013 through recruiting outreach, internal networking, business resource groups and mentoring programs.   Grainger's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors is comprised of approximately 33% female and 25% racially and ethnically diverse directors. Grainger also maintains this strong commitment with the CEO's leadership team and throughout the organization. The CEO's leadership team is comprised of approximately 43% women and approximately 29% racially and ethnically diverse leaders. As of December 31, 2022, within Grainger\u2019s U.S. workforce, approximately 39% of team members were women and approximately 39% of team members were racially and ethnically diverse.    8 8 8   Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development Grainger believes that a great customer experience starts with a great team member experience. The Company is committed to providing team members with resources designed to help them succeed. Grainger focuses on creating opportunities for team member growth, development and training, including offering a comprehensive talent program that continues throughout a team member\u2019s career. This talent program is comprised of performance management, career management, professional development learning opportunities and milestone leadership development programs.  Compensation and Benefits Grainger believes that its future success is highly dependent upon the Company\u2019s continued ability to attract, retain and motivate team members. As part of its efforts in these areas, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to meet the diverse needs of team members and support their physical and mental health and well-being, financial future and work-life balance. Team members are given access to health plan resources which include 24-hour virtual health services, disease management, tobacco cessation, parental support, stress management and weight loss programs with access to online support communities. In addition, Grainger provides retirement savings, paid holidays and time off, educational assistance and income protection benefits as well as a variety of other programs.
