Backlog consisted of: (1)\u00a0orders for which written authorizations have been accepted, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; and (2)\u00a0contractual service revenue and maintenance fees. Backlog by reportable segment as of October\u00a029, 2023 and October\u00a030, 2022 was as follows: \u00a020232022\u00a0(In millions, except percentages)Semiconductor Systems$11,127\u00a065\u00a0%$12,691\u00a067\u00a0%Applied Global Services5,162\u00a030\u00a0%5,643\u00a030\u00a0%Display and Adjacent Markets833\u00a05\u00a0%581\u00a03\u00a0%Corporate and Other49\u00a0\u2014\u00a0%96\u00a0\u2014\u00a0%Total$17,171\u00a0100\u00a0%$19,011\u00a0100\u00a0% Of the total backlog as of October\u00a029, 2023, approximately 30% is not reasonably expected to be filled within the next 12 months. Our backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes such as new orders or cancellations. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies Our worldwide manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly, integration and test of various proprietary and commercial parts, components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems. We utilize a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, primarily including China, Israel, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, the United States and other countries in Asia and Europe. We use qualified vendors, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts, services and product support. Our supply chain strategy commits to adhere to ethical labor practices, responsible minerals sourcing, Responsible Business Alliance and SEMI guidelines, and the Applied Materials Standards of Business Conduct as defined in our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitment.  Although we make reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, this is not always possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be obtained from only a qualified single supplier or a limited group of qualified suppliers. We seek to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for parts; monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers; maintaining appropriate inventories of parts; qualifying new parts on a timely basis; and ensuring quality and performance of parts. Research, Development and Engineering Our long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities, including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets. Our significant investments in research, development and engineering (RD&E) must generally enable us to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. We work closely with our global customers and ecosystem partners to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements. Our product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the United States, as well as in China, Europe, India, Israel, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. In addition, certain outsourced RD&E activities, process support and customer demonstrations are performed in China, India, Singapore, Taiwan and the United States. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Marketing and Sales Because of the highly technical nature of our products, we market and sell products worldwide almost entirely through a direct sales force. We have operations in many countries, with some of our business activities concentrated in certain geographic areas, and global and regional economic and political conditions can impact our business and financial results. Our business is based on capital equipment investments by major semiconductor, display and other manufacturers, and is subject to significant variability in customer demand for our products. Customers\u2019 expenditures depend on many factors, including: general economic conditions; anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors, display technologies and other electronic devices; the development of new technologies; customers\u2019 factory utilization; capital resources and financing; trade policies and export regulations; and government incentives. In addition, a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries has been end-demand for mobile consumer products, which has been characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and, in turn, our business.  Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and long-lived assets attributable to our geographic regions is included in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following companies accounted for at least 10 percent of our net sales in each fiscal year, which were for products and services in multiple reportable segments. \u00a0202320222021Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.15%12%20%Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited19%20%15%Intel Corporation*10%* ______________________________ * Less than 10% 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Competition The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Our ability to compete generally depends on our ability to commercialize our technology in a timely manner, continually improve our products, and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements. Significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation, productivity, cost-effectiveness and the ability to support a global customer base. The importance of these factors varies according to customers\u2019 needs, including product mix and respective product requirements, applications, and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions. Substantial competition exists in all areas of our business. Competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region, which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies, to global, diversified companies, which operate in more complex global economic and regulatory environments. Our ability to compete requires a high level of investment in RD&E, marketing and sales, and global customer support activities. We believe that many of our products have strong competitive positions. The competitive environment for each segment is described below. The semiconductor industry is driven by demand for advanced electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive electronics, storage, and other products. The growth of data and emerging end-market drivers such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, 5G networks, smart vehicles and augmented and virtual reality are also creating the next wave of growth for the industry. As a result, products within the Semiconductor Systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, increasingly complex chip architectures, new materials and an increasing number of applications. While certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach. The rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors. Our broad portfolio offers a variety of differentiated products, including co-optimized and integrated materials solutions that enable unique films, structures and devices. Our products must continuously evolve to satisfy customers\u2019 requirements to compete effectively in the marketplace. We allocate resources among our numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product depending on market requirements. There are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry. Some of these competitors offer a single product line and others offer multiple product lines, and range from serving a single region to global, diversified companies. Products and services within the Applied Global Services segment complement the Semiconductor Systems and Display and Adjacent Markets segments\u2019 products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements. Competition in the Applied Global Services segment includes a diverse group of numerous third-party service providers and customers that perform their own service. To compete effectively, we offer products and services to improve tool performance, lower overall cost of ownership, and increase yields and productivity of customers\u2019 fab operations. Significant competitive factors include productivity, cost-effectiveness, and the level of technical service and support. The importance of these factors varies according to customers\u2019 needs and the type of products or services offered.  Products in the Display and Adjacent Markets segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors primarily in Asia. We hold established market positions with our technically-differentiated LCD and OLED manufacturing solutions for PECVD, color filter PVD, PVD array, PVD touch panel, and TFT array testing, although our market position could change quickly due to customers\u2019 evolving requirements. Important factors affecting the competitive position of our Display and Adjacent Markets products include: industry trends, our ability to innovate and develop new products, and the extent to which our products are technically-differentiated, as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and our existing position at these customers. 10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Patents and Licenses Protection of our technology assets through enforcement of our intellectual property rights, including patents, is important for our competitive position. Our practice is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries for inventions that we consider significant. We have more than 19,600 active patents in the United States and other countries, and additional applications are pending for new inventions. Although we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent, our rights and the products made and sold under our patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of our business. In addition to our patents, we possess other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, and copyrights.  We enter into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when it is determined to be in our best interest. We pay royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use, in several of our products, of certain patented technologies. We also receive royalties from licenses granted to third parties. Royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been material to our consolidated results of operations. In the normal course of business, we periodically receive and make inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In responding to such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or successfully prosecute or defend our position, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Governmental Regulation As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions.

Our ability to create differentiated value in the marketplace is driven by the capability of our people to anticipate technology inflections and integrate customer requirements. To achieve this level of value creation, we believe we must attract, hire, develop and retain a world-class global workforce. We invest in our employees by providing quality training and learning opportunities; promoting inclusion, equity and diversity; and upholding a high standard of ethics and respect for human rights.  As of October 29, 2023, we employed approximately 34,000 regular full-time employees, of whom approximately 44%, 43% and 13% resided in the Asia-Pacific region, North America, and Europe, Middle East and Africa, respectively. Our team spans 24 countries, reflecting various cultures, backgrounds, race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ages, and disability, veteran and military status. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  We value great talent and different perspectives, knowing that diversity is one of our greatest strengths. We therefore strive to provide fair and equal opportunity for career development and advancement to all our employees and incorporate respect for diverse backgrounds and perspectives into our culture at every level \u2013 from strategy and policy down to everyday interactions. We expect that our commitment to strengthening our culture of inclusion will broaden the diversity of our workplace and help us build a culture that benefits everyone. In recent years, we continued to make progress in our culture of inclusion journey, including, among other things, increasing female representation in the U.S. and global workforce, and increasing U.S. underrepresented minority representation. As of October 29, 2023, our global workforce was 79.6% male and 20.3% female, and 19.9% of our workforce in the United States was composed of underrepresented minorities. Additionally, we are investing in inclusion learning experiences. For example, we have various initiatives to further develop our leaders to lead even more inclusively and further deepen engagement with employees. Talent Acquisition and Retention  We believe that our future success is highly dependent upon our continued ability to attract, develop, retain and engage employees. As part of our effort to attract and retain employees, we offer competitive rewards, compensation and benefits, including an Employee Stock Incentive Plan, an Employees\u2019 Stock Purchase Plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, parental and family leave, adoption credits, holiday and paid time off, and tuition assistance. Employee Learning & Development  We seek to create growth and development opportunities to support an engaged and inclusive workforce. We promote holistic employee learning and development based on the 70/20/10 model--70% on-the-job learning, 20% social/collaborative and 10% formal training, with a focus on advancing technical skills as well as improving general business acumen to address increasing work complexity. Also, to help expand professional breadth, we use a federated model where the segments and functions provide technical and job-specific training tied to their disciplines, while general professional, management, and leadership training is provided at the corporate level. All training is coordinated centrally and aligned with common objectives through Applied Global University. In addition to instructor-led and web-based training, we offer state-of-the-art training modalities, such as AI-based simulations and Augmented and Virtual Reality learning capabilities, to help develop our new products, train our manufacturing and field support employees, and collaborate remotely. Each fiscal year, employees are provided the opportunity to complete the required 40 hours of learning.  12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Employee Engagement We have historically measured employee engagement through surveys to gain insight into employees\u2019 experiences, levels of workplace satisfaction, and key drivers for engagement, inclusion and overall well-being. In fiscal 2023, we conducted an all-employee survey anonymously through an external partner to encourage maximal participation and elicit candid responses. We also benchmarked the survey results against a large and standardized data set involving large technology companies globally. The survey results and the benchmarking data allowed us to better understand enterprise-wide trends, gauge effectiveness of interventions, and define targeted employee populations (e.g., early tenure employees). They also provided leaders and people managers with actionable insights tailored to their own groups that can further enhance employee engagement and inclusion. These actionable insights are then integrated with the people strategy process and cadence within the Company. Additional information regarding our activities related to our people and sustainability, as well as our workforce diversity data, can be found in our latest Sustainability Report and Annex thereto, which are located on our website at https://www.appliedmaterials.com/us/en/corporate-responsibility.html.
