Risk Factors and \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above.    Triple Bottom Line  PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s purpose is to deliver for their hometowns, serve the planet, and lead with love.  In support of this purpose, the companies employ a Lean operating model designed to drive more effective and responsive decision-making, reduce the difficulties many coworkers face in their day-to-day work, and deliver better outcomes for customers and communities.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d of people, planet, and prosperity, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value they create for customers and investors, but also their responsibility to social and environmental goals.  The triple bottom line is designed to balance the interests of the companies\u2019 many stakeholders, and it reflects the broader societal impacts of the companies\u2019 activities.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and prosperity in their daily operations as well as in their long-term strategic decisions.  The Utility will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment in order to support its customer-driven investment plan while pursuing cost-control measures that would allow it to maintain the affordability of its service.  The Lean operating system is an important means of realizing PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s objective of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service.  People  The people element of the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s commitment to their workforce, their customers, the residents of local communities in which the companies do business, and other stakeholders.    PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s goal is to continually reduce risk to keep customers, the communities they serve, and their workforce (both employees and contractors) safe.  Their focus is on continuously building an organization where every work activity is designed to facilitate safe performance, every worker knows and practices safe behaviors, and every individual is encouraged to speak up and stop work if they see unsafe or risky behavior, and has confidence that their concerns and ideas will be heard and pursued.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to significantly improving their safety performance by understanding their risks, prioritizing their work, using controls to reduce risks, and continuously measuring and improving risk reduction.   PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s human capital resource objectives are to build and retain an engaged, well trained, diverse, and equitably-paid workforce.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility place a high priority on delivering customer value and providing a hometown customer experience.  The Utility\u2019s customer-driven investment program is aimed at improving safety, increasing electric and gas reliability, and improving customer satisfaction.   For more information, see \u201cHuman Capital\u201d below.  Planet  The planet element of the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s commitment to protect and serve the environment.  This commitment extends beyond compliance with various state and federal environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that integrating and managing climate change and other environmental considerations in the companies\u2019 business strategies creates long-term value for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and for their customers, communities, coworkers, and other stakeholders.  Mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change presents opportunities for growth for the Utility\u2019s business and economic opportunity for the communities it serves.    12 12 12   The Utility strives to be prepared to continue to deliver safe, clean, affordable, and reliable energy in the face of increasingly severe and extreme climate-driven natural hazards.  To build resilience to these hazards, the Utility is working to systematically integrate the consideration of forward-looking climate data and tools in its decision-making.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility also work with policymakers and regulators to advance effective climate adaptation policy in California, and work directly with local governments and communities on adaptation solutions.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have committed to helping heal the planet.  PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s Climate Strategy Report, which is available to the public, describes the companies\u2019 climate goals and plans to meet those goals.  To meet their longer-term climate goals, PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to scale their efforts to decarbonize the electric system to accommodate a shift to vehicle electrification, integrate a proliferation of distributed energy resources, and achieve increased penetration of renewable energy combined with investments in the grid and energy storage.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility also plan to transition the gas system to cleaner fuels, increasingly target natural gas delivery for hard-to-electrify customer sectors, and support efforts to accelerate building electrification.  The objective is to do so in an orderly manner to achieve a positive customer and community experience, while reducing natural gas system investments in targeted electrified communities.  The impacts of climate change on the Utility\u2019s infrastructure are already a reality.  Record-breaking extreme heat and heat waves are increasingly a regular occurrence throughout California.  Peak electric loads are expected to increase with increasing temperatures due to direct impacts of ambient temperatures on equipment and direct impacts on electricity demand driven by rising air conditioning installation and usage, and increasingly driven in the future from widespread progress in adoption of beneficial electrification technologies.  The Utility\u2019s assets on the coast and in or near watersheds face potential increased exposures to coastal, riverine, and precipitation-related flooding because of climate-driven changes in precipitation and sea-level rise.  Climate change will also continue to intensify the potential for wildfires throughout California.  The worsening conditions across California increase the likelihood and severity of wildfires, including those where the Utility\u2019s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire\u2019s ignition.  Reducing risk will be even more important as climate change continues to exacerbate the risks facing the Utility.  A key element of preparing the Utility for the physical risks of climate change is an updated and more detailed system-wide CVA of the Utility\u2019s assets, operations, and services, which the Utility expects to file with the CPUC in 2024.  The CVA is expected to improve the Utility\u2019s understanding of its exposure to climate hazards and the sensitivity of assets and operations to these hazards.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to pursue policies and programs that enable safe, reliable, and affordable clean and resilient energy for their customers.  As a result of actions already taken by PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the companies have:  \u2022Delivered clean electricity to customers in 2022 that was more than 95% GHG free.  \u2022Helped customers avoid emissions and energy costs through robust energy efficiency programs.   \u2022Awarded contracts for more than 3.3 GWs of battery energy storage to be deployed over the next several years, strengthening California\u2019s grid efficiency and reliability.   \u2022Installed approximately 340 charging ports for electric vehicles at schools, parks, public charging locations, and in support of fleets - with nearly half in disadvantaged communities - and received regulatory approval for new innovative pilots on vehicle grid integration, submetering, and dynamic rates.  \u2022Brought the total number of interconnected private solar customers to more than 700,000 and supported more than 50,000 customers who have installed battery storage at their homes or businesses.  \u2022Continued to advance decarbonization initiatives for the Utility\u2019s natural gas delivery system, including meeting the CPUC-mandated methane emission reduction target ahead of schedule and accelerating initiatives to meet its voluntary 2030 reduction goal.  13 13 13   The CPUC coordinates the planning of supply resources through the Integrated Resource Planning (\u201cIRP\u201d) proceeding and has determined that replacing the power generated by Diablo Canyon is the responsibility of all LSEs within the CAISO.  Looking ahead, the Utility expects its GHG-free energy supply mix of renewable, large hydroelectric, and nuclear generation resources to decrease as, beginning in 2023, the Utility is required to offer for allocation or sale renewables portfolio standard-eligible (\u201cRPS\u201d) attributes that the Utility procured on behalf of customers that subsequently switched to non-Utility providers in order to comply with regulatory mandates and to manage customer affordability.  Towards the end of the decade and beyond, the Utility\u2019s GHG-free energy supply mix is expected to grow relative to 2025 levels as the Utility procures new GHG-free generation and storage to meet California\u2019s IRP GHG emissions reduction targets and California\u2019s clean energy goals.  For more information, see \u201cElectric Integrated Resource Planning and Related Procurement\u201d below.  Prosperity  The prosperity element of the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s commitment to meeting their financial objectives and providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities they serve.  Management believes clean energy should be affordable for and inclusive of all economic backgrounds.   Under cost-of-service ratemaking, a utility\u2019s earnings depend on the outcomes of its ratemaking proceedings and its ability to manage costs.  See \u201cRatemaking Mechanisms\u201d below and \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC and FERC proceedings.  Generally, differences between forecast costs and actual costs (discussed in \u201cUtility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings\u201d in Results of Operations in Item 7. MD&A) can occur for numerous reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forces on the cost of labor and materials.  Differences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to taking steps to improve their credit ratings and metrics over time, including by reducing their debt.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have set goals to reduce their debt over time, including reducing PG&E Corporation\u2019s debt by at least $2\u00a0billion by the end of 2026.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that reducing the consolidated debt will help them achieve investment grade credit ratings for their unsecured securities, for the benefit of both customers and investors.  For more information, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  Pursuant to SB 901, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction to recover $7.5\u00a0billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs, which was approved by the CPUC on February 28, 2022.  PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, issued $3.6\u00a0billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds on May 10, 2022 and $3.9\u00a0billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds on July 20, 2022.  The net proceeds from both transactions were used to reimburse the Utility for previously incurred recovery costs, including the retirement of $5.0\u00a0billion of Utility debt and the repayment of a portion of the loans outstanding under the Utility's revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement.  The Utility intends to use a portion of the remaining proceeds to fund the redemption of $1.0\u00a0billion of Utility debt.  For more information, see \u201cApplication for Post-Emergence Securitization Transaction\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.  On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s common stock, as well as the Utility\u2019s preferred stock.  PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to issue dividends is subject to restrictions.  On February 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility\u2019s preferred stock.  On June 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility also reinstated the dividend on the Utility\u2019s common stock.  For more information, see \u201cDividends\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.  Total capital expenditures (including accruals) recorded in 2022 were $9.6\u00a0billion.  The Utility\u2019s total capital expenditures (including accruals) are forecasted to be between $7.9\u00a0billion and $11.2\u00a0billion for 2023, between $7.9\u00a0billion and $12.2\u00a0billion for 2024, between $8.0\u00a0billion and $12.7\u00a0billion for 2025, between $8.1\u00a0billion and $13.3\u00a0billion for 2026, and between $8.1\u00a0billion and $13.8\u00a0billion for 2027.  The completion of projects, the timing of expenditures, and the associated cost recovery may be affected by permitting requirements and delays, construction schedules, availability of labor, equipment and materials, financing, legal and regulatory approvals and developments, community requests or protests, weather, and other unforeseen conditions.     14 14 14   The Utility expects to make additional capital expenditures, the recovery of which will be subject to future regulatory approval, including the 2023 GRC.  These expenditures include capital expenditures exceeding amounts authorized in the 2020 GRC and 2019 GT&S, and expenditures to be included in a later stage of the 2023 GRC or separate applications.  These expenditures are expected to primarily be for wildfire mitigation, transportation electrification, and the Lakeside Building.  Additionally, $3.21\u00a0billion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditures will be excluded from the Utility\u2019s equity rate base pursuant to AB 1054.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to keeping gas and electric services affordable for all customers.  The Utility\u2019s capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, increasing environmental regulations, and the cumulative impact of other public policy requirements collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates.  Certain CPUC proceedings could impact different types of customers differently.  Similarly, although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs through rates as \u201cpass-through\u201d costs, commodity prices rose substantially in 2022, relative to 2021.  The Utility has set a goal to increase customer capital investments while also limiting customer impacts, including by reducing non-fuel Operating and maintenance costs by two percent per year and by seeking efficient financing.  The Utility plans to meet its two percent non-fuel Operating and maintenance cost reduction goal through increased efficiency, including waste elimination through the Lean operating system.  The Utility has a number of programs in place to assist low-income customers, such as the CARE program.  Under the CARE program, income-qualified customers can receive a monthly discount of 20% or more on their gas and electric bill.    PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes the companies\u2019 progress toward world-class performance measured with the triple bottom line framework.  In 2021, the Utility spent $4.01\u00a0billion with certified diverse suppliers, representing 38.7% of its total spend.  Performance: Underpinning the Triple Bottom Line  PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the Lean operating system, which includes four basic \u201cplays:\u201d visual management; operating reviews; problem solving; and standard work.  Visual management allows teams to see how they are performing against their most important metrics using real-time data.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility hold daily, weekly, and monthly operating reviews designed to align the performance of workers closest to the work with the goals and objectives of senior leadership.  These brief meetings help the Utility identify gaps and quickly develop plans to support the teams performing the work and give the Utility more visibility, control and predictability in its operations.  Problem solving involves a structured approach to identifying, containing, analyzing, and solving problems in order to capitalize on opportunities.  Standard work reduces costs and increases productivity by ensuring a consistent company-wide method for completing a task.  For instance, the Lean operating system helped the Utility identify patterns in the conditions of ignitions and led to the implementation of EPSS and drove significant benefit and understanding in how PG&E Corporation and the Utility manage customer satisfaction.  PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s performance is also driven by an increased focus on alignment on shared outcomes among its leadership and within the organization.  In 2023, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s Lean deployment will focus on a fifth play, waste elimination, which enables the companies to identify and eliminate inefficiencies in both process and workflow in a sustainable manner, as well as the continued adoption of a performance playbook and improvements to financial visibility and controls.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have implemented a regional service model to bring the Utility closer to the hometowns it serves.  Through the regional service model, the Utility has restructured its service area into five regions, with leaders in each region to deliver improved public and employee safety, customer service, and operational reliability outcomes.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to designing an electric system that is resilient to climate change, decarbonized, and optimized to local and system needs.  California has experienced unprecedented weather conditions in recent years and the Utility\u2019s service area remains susceptible to additional wildfire activity.  In response, the Utility has implemented operational changes and investments that reduce wildfire risk, including:  \u2022Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings: EPSS adjusts the sensitivity of circuit protection devices on selected power lines to de-energize them more rapidly in the event of a disturbance to help prevent potential ignitions.  After EPSS was initiated, both the size and number of CPUC-reportable ignitions were reduced substantially on EPSS-enabled circuits, compared to the prior three-year average.  15 15 15   \u2022Public Safety Power Shutoffs:  The PSPS program proactively de-energizes power lines in response to forecasted weather conditions.  Since its inception in late 2017, the PSPS program has become more targeted because the Utility has developed more granular risk models, including adding consideration of vegetation management and maintenance tag statuses for scoping PSPS events.  The Utility has also installed sectionalizers for more targeted de-energizations of circuits and transmission lines.  In 2022, the Utility did not have any PSPS events.  \u2022Vegetation management:  The Utility inspects its overhead electric distribution and transmission facilities on an annual basis to identify and clear vegetation that might grow or fall into utility equipment.  The Utility is also increasing oversight and engagement with the contractors supporting vegetation management work.  \u2022Asset inspections:  Since 2018, the Utility has reoriented its asset inspections programs toward asset condition and consequence risk, particularly wildfire risk, and these programs have become more thorough, standardized, digitized, and verifiable.  The Utility uses risk-informed inspection cycles.  In 2022, the Utility continued to refine its risk modeling, including further incorporating data from asset inspections.  As a result of the improved inspection program, the Utility\u2019s inspections in recent years have begun to more thoroughly identify equipment conditions.   \u2022System hardening:  System hardening entails repairing, replacing, or eliminating existing power lines in HFTDs and installing stronger and more resilient equipment.  As the Utility\u2019s asset inspections have identified more equipment conditions, the Utility has hardened its system by correcting significantly more equipment conditions than in prior years.  Hardening methods include replacing bare overhead conductor with covered conductor and installing stronger poles, removing lines, and serving customers through remote grids, or converting lines from overhead to underground.  In 2021, the Utility announced a program to underground 10,000 miles of electric distribution lines in high wildfire risk areas.  In 2022, the Utility undergrounded 180 miles of lines, which exceeded its plan to underground 175 miles of lines.  Undergrounding can substantially reduce ignition risk and improve reliability during storms or periods of high wildfire risk.  The Utility also brought online two additional \u201cremote grids\u201d in 2022, which allow distribution lines in HFTDs to be removed and replaced with locally sited resources.  Remote grids can reduce costs and fire risks, while maintaining service to participating customers.    As a result of these measures, the Utility significantly reduced both the size and number of CPUC-reportable ignitions and number of acres burned in 2022, compared to prior years.  Even as the Utility works to mitigate wildfire risk, it also works to reduce the impact of those mitigations on its customers, including making the PSPS program less disruptive through sectionalizing devices for both distribution and transmission lines, temporary generation applications, and implementation of microgrids which enable portions of the grid to safely isolate areas from the broader grid and energize them during outages.  For example, in 2022, the Utility prepared 12 distribution microgrids to operate with temporary generation if needed.  In 2022, the Utility expanded the EPSS program to all high fire risk areas.  In addition, the Utility uses multiple weather models on a daily basis that indicate which circuits to enable with safety settings and which to put in normal protection settings, optimizing for maximum wildfire ignition risk reduction when needed and enhancing reliability benefits when wildfire risk is low.  In 2022, the Utility also began reviewing and adjusting settings to improve coordination among devices on a circuit to reduce the number of customers impacted by an outage.  In 2023, the Utility will expand its deployment of advanced technology to detect low-current faults, which is expected to further decrease wildfire ignition risk.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility are continuing to invest in a safe and reliable gas system and are working toward targeted electrification, greening the gas supply, and shaping California energy policy.  The Utility has focused on continuously improving its gas operations safety record.  Since the San Bruno natural gas pipeline explosion in 2010, the Utility\u2019s asset safety efforts have included replacing distribution mains and transmission pipelines, as well as strength testing transmission pipelines.  The Utility uses in-line inspections to assess the integrity of transmission pipelines.  The Utility also uses safety and control systems to monitor, gather, and process real-time data on its gas system.  In 2022, the Utility\u2019s gas operations had two workforce serious injuries and fatalities (\u201cSIF-A\u201d) incidents and reductions in the number of injuries that result in days away, restricted or transferred duty per 200,000 hours worked (\u201cDART\u201d).  The Utility\u2019s gas system has not had a safety-related incident that affected the public and resulted in a fatality or injury since 2015 or 2018, respectively.  16 16 16   The Utility has engaged in educating employees, contractors, and the public regarding safe digging programs and practices for their awareness during construction and when digging near the Utility\u2019s underground gas and electric assets.  The Utility also installed safety devices that automatically detect increasing pressure on systems and stop the flow of gas to avoid outages and overpressure events.  Additionally, the Utility continues to streamline its efforts to respond to outages on a timely basis.  The Utility\u2019s outage response is designed to keep the public safe while limiting customer outages and returning service safely and as quickly as possible.   The Utility\u2019s generation operations have focused on safety and reliability.  In 2022, the Utility\u2019s nuclear and non-nuclear generation operations achieved zero SIF-A incidents and reductions in DART.  Challenged by a drought year, the Utility scheduled dispatch and rescheduled outages to maximize availability during the summer months when demand for electricity is highest.  The Utility is working to implement a comprehensive non-nuclear generation asset management strategy and further mature its outage and project management capabilities.   In 2022, the Utility achieved International Organization for Standardization (\u201cISO\u201d) 55001 certification for its electric operations and generation asset management systems.  The Utility also achieved ISO 55001 re-certification for its gas operations asset management.  ISO 55001 certification required the Utility to demonstrate that it has policies and procedures to manage its assets responsibly and effectively.   Regulatory Environment\u00a0  The Utility\u2019s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.  At the state level, the Utility is regulated primarily by the CPUC.  At the federal level, the Utility is regulated primarily by the FERC and the NRC.  The Utility is also subject to the requirements of other federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including with respect to safety, the environment, and health, such as the NTSB and OEIS.    This section and the \u201cEnvironmental Regulation\u201d and the \u201cRatemaking Mechanisms\u201d sections below summarize some of the more significant laws, regulations, and regulatory proceedings affecting the Utility.  For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.   PG&E Corporation is a \u201cpublic utility holding company\u201d as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory oversight by the FERC.  PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries are exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other than the obligation to provide access to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes.  California Public Utilities Commission   The CPUC is a regulatory agency that regulates privately owned public utilities in California.  The CPUC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions of service for the Utility\u2019s electric and natural gas distribution operations, electric generation, and natural gas transmission and storage services.  The CPUC has also exercised jurisdiction over the Utility\u2019s issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the Utility\u2019s electric and natural gas retail customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities used in providing electric and natural gas utility service.  The CPUC enforces state laws and regulations that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utility gas and electric facilities.\u00a0 The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $100,000 per day, per violation.  The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality of the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations, the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected, and the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation.  The CPUC also is required to consider the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.    The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issue citations and impose penalties for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports.  Under the current gas and electric citation programs adopted by the CPUC in September 2016, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation; but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it has the authority to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $100,000 per day, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citation issued.  Similar to penalties imposed by the CPUC, penalty payments for citations issued pursuant to the gas and electric safety citation programs are the responsibility of shareholders of an issuer and may not be recovered in rates or otherwise directly or indirectly charged to customers.  The CPUC has also authorized the SED to propose for CPUC approval administrative consent orders and administrative enforcement orders when the SED deems a formal OII unnecessary.  17 17 17   The California State Legislature also directs the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to wildfires and wildfire cost recovery, increasing renewable energy resources, the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, the establishment of energy storage procurement targets, and the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  The CPUC is responsible for approving funding and administration of state-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs.  The CPUC also conducts audits and reviews of the Utility\u2019s accounting, performance, and compliance with regulatory guidelines.  The CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financial conditions that require PG&E Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility\u2019s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner.

The CAISO controls the operation of the electric transmission system in most of California and a small part of Nevada and provides open access transmission service on a non-discriminatory basis.  The CAISO is also responsible for planning transmission system additions, ensuring the maintenance of adequate reserves of generating capacity, ensuring that the reliability of the transmission system is maintained, and operating the wholesale power market in most of California and an interstate energy imbalance market.   Nuclear Regulatory Commission  The NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility\u2019s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the Utility\u2019s retired nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay.  See \u201cElectricity Resources\u201d below.  NRC regulations require extensive monitoring and review of the safety, radiological, seismic, environmental, and security aspects of these facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or to force a shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both.  NRC safety and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capital expenditures at Diablo Canyon, and substantial capital expenditures could be required in the future.  For more information about Diablo Canyon, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.    Other Regulators   The CEC is California\u2019s primary energy policy and planning agency.  The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over 50 MW within California.  The CEC also is responsible for forecasts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities\u2019 electricity procurement plans and for adopting building and appliance energy efficiency requirements.    The CARB is the state agency responsible for setting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits.  The CARB is also responsible for adopting and enforcing regulations to implement state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California.  See \u201cEnvironmental Regulation - Air Quality and Climate Change\u201d below.  18 18 18    The NTSB is an independent U.S. government investigative agency responsible for civil transportation accident investigations, including pipeline accidents.  The NTSB also conducts special investigations and safety studies, and issues safety recommendations to prevent future accidents.    The California Geologic Energy Management Division is the state agency responsible for establishing and enforcing regulations for the operation of the Utility\u2019s underground gas storage facilities.   The OEIS is a state agency responsible for reviewing and approving the Utility\u2019s WMP and for evaluating the Utility\u2019s implementation of the WMP.  The OEIS is also responsible for reviewing and issuing the Utility\u2019s annual safety certification, annually reviewing and approving the Utility\u2019s executive compensation plan, conducting assessments of the Utility\u2019s safety culture, and conducting field inspections of wildfire mitigation activities.     In addition, the Utility obtains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility\u2019s generation facilities, electricity transmission lines, natural gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities.  The Utility also periodically obtains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with distribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy or use public property for the operation of the Utility\u2019s business and to conduct certain related operations.  The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties that permit the Utility to install, operate, and maintain the Utility\u2019s electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and highways.  In exchange for the right to use public streets and highways, the Utility pays annual fees to the cities and counties.  In most cases, the Utility\u2019s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term, with no expiration date.  For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factors.   Material Effects of Compliance with Governmental Regulations  As indicated above, the Utility\u2019s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.  Compliance with such extensive government regulations requires substantial expenditures and has had in the past and may continue to have in the future a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and competitive position.  For more information about costs incurred to comply with government regulations and related material effects on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d in Item 7. MD&A, and Notes 15 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.   Environmental Regulation  The Utility\u2019s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of the Utility\u2019s personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous and radioactive substances; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of CO2 and other GHG emissions; the transportation, handling, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The penalties for violation of these laws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions.  These laws and requirements also may require the Utility, under certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Generally, the Utility recovers most of the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations through the Utility\u2019s rates, subject to reasonableness review.  Environmental costs associated with the clean-up of most sites that contain hazardous substances are subject to a ratemaking mechanism described in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.     Hazardous Substance Compliance and Remediation  The Utility\u2019s facilities are subject to various regulations adopted by the EPA, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended.  The Utility is also subject to the regulations adopted by other federal agencies responsible for implementing federal environmental laws.  The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations adopted by the State of California and various state and local agencies.  These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substance on the (1) owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and (3) in some cases, their corporate successors.  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, these persons (known as \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d) may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the harm caused to natural resources, and paying for the costs of health studies.  19 19 19   The Utility has a comprehensive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  Under federal and California laws, the Utility may be responsible for remediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site.  The Utility\u2019s remediation activities are overseen by the DTSC, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.  The Utility has incurred significant environmental remediation liabilities associated with former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where natural gas compressor stations are located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances.  Groundwater at the Utility\u2019s Hinkley and Topock natural gas compressor stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility\u2019s past operating practices.  The Utility is responsible for remediating this groundwater contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.  For more information about environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  Air Quality and Climate Change  The Utility\u2019s electric generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, vehicle fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws, including the federal Clean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes.  These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone, carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter, and other emissions.  Federal Regulation  At the federal level, the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.  Although there have been several legislative attempts to address climate change through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted.  In the absence of federal legislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions.  Tackling the climate crisis is a key priority of the Biden Administration, and the Administration has signaled its intent to use its executive and regulatory authorities to reduce emissions in line with science-based targets.  On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the EPA to consider suspending, revising or rescinding the Trump Administration\u2019s rule for methane emissions from new sources in the oil and gas sector and propose a companion regulation for existing sources, including the transmission, processing and storage segments of the industry.  For power plants, the EPA is expected to propose a more stringent GHG standard for existing sources in the wake of challenges to the Trump Administration\u2019s Affordable Clean Energy rule.   State Regulation  California\u2019s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 originally provided for the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.  The CARB has approved various regulations to achieve the 2020 target, including GHG emissions reporting and a state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade program that sets gradually declining limits (or \u201ccaps\u201d) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of the economy.    The cap-and-trade program applies to the electric generation, large industrial, natural gas, petroleum, and transportation sectors.  The Utility\u2019s compliance obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHG emissions attributable to the combustion of natural gas delivered to the Utility\u2019s customers other than large natural gas delivery customers that are separately regulated as covered entities and have their own compliance obligation.    The cap-and-trade program has been extended through 2030.  During each year of the program, the CARB issues emission allowances (i.e., the rights to emit GHGs) equal to the amount of GHG emissions allowed for that year.  Entities with a compliance obligation can obtain allowances from the CARB at quarterly auctions or from third parties or exchanges.  Complying entities may also satisfy a portion of their compliance obligation through the purchase of offset credits (e.g., credits for GHG reductions achieved by third parties, such as landowners, livestock owners, and farmers, that occur outside of the entities\u2019 facilities through CARB-qualified offset projects such as reforestation or biomass projects).  The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to be passed through to customers.    20 20 20   California law requires that the CARB ensure a 40% reduction in GHGs by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.  The California RPS program that requires utilities to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduce GHG emissions in California.  California\u2019s RPS targets are 50% by December 31, 2026 and 60% by December 31, 2030, and the State has set a policy of meeting 100% of retail sales from eligible renewables and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.  In 2022, AB 1279 was signed into law, codifying a statewide goal to achieve economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045 and to maintain net negative emissions thereafter.  Additionally in 2022, SB 1020 established targets that renewable and zero-carbon resources will supply 90% of utilities\u2019 retail sales to customers by 2035 and 95% of retail sales by 2040.  The Utility will be an active participant in regulatory proceedings to determine how the state will achieve carbon neutrality.  For the percentage of the Utility\u2019s estimated total net deliveries of electricity to customers in 2022, including estimated GHG-free and renewable energy percentages, see \u201cElectric Utility Operations-Electricity Resources\u201d below.    Climate Change Resilience Strategies  Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions  During 2022, the Utility continued its programs to mitigate the impact of the Utility\u2019s operations (including customer energy usage) on the environment, consistent with the Utility\u2019s commitment to a healthy environment and carbon neutral-energy system for all Californians.  Adapting to the Physical Impacts of Climate Change  Effectively managing physical climate risk will become increasingly critical as the physical impacts of climate change become increasingly frequent and severe over the coming years in California.  The Utility\u2019s climate resilience efforts continue to focus on characterizing and mitigating the physical impacts of climate change to the Utility\u2019s infrastructure, assets, and operations.  The Utility is making substantial investments to build a more resilient system that can better withstand extreme weather and related emergencies.  For more information on such investments, see \u201cPerformance: Underpinning the Triple Bottom Line\u201d above.   The Utility\u2019s preparations for the physical risks of climate change include an updated, more detailed, system\u2011wide CVA of the Utility\u2019s assets, operations, and services, which will be completed in 2024 and filed with the CPUC.  The updated CVA will improve the Utility\u2019s understanding of its exposure to climate hazards in the near- and long-term and the sensitivity of assets and operations to these hazards.  It will also inform the Utility\u2019s understanding of the ease or difficulty of various options for adapting to changing conditions.    In the past few years, the Utility\u2019s electric distribution system has experienced multiple major outage-causing events associated with extreme heat events and peak loads.  Peak loads are expected to increase with increasing temperatures due to direct impacts of ambient temperatures on equipment and direct impacts on electricity demand driven by rising air conditioning installation and usage.  The Utility\u2019s assets on the coast and in or near watersheds face potential increased exposures to coastal, riverine (fluvial), and precipitation related (pluvial) flooding because of climate\u2011driven changes in precipitation and sea level rise.  The risk of damage to or interruptions of operations at facilities such as substations is predicted to increase over time due to sea level rise.  Electric and gas equipment and safe access for operations must be prepared for these changing conditions.  Changing precipitation dynamics may impact the Utility\u2019s hydroelectric generation.  Diminishing future water availability and altered runoff timing during extreme drought poses risks to hydropower generation, operations, and revenue.  Also, extreme rain events suggest enhanced risk of hydropower asset damage or failure associated with flooding, which in the worst cases (e.g., uncontrolled water release) may have catastrophic impacts.  Climate change will also continue to intensify the potential for wildfires throughout California.  Models incorporating future temperature and precipitation projections suggest that landscape susceptibility to wildfire within the Utility\u2019s service area will continue to increase over time, with an expansion of areas that may become HFTD and an intensification of risk within HFTDs.  Climate change may also result in increased potential of lines to cause ignitions or to require PSPS events, as well as the potential for the Utility\u2019s equipment to sustain damage from wildfires of any origin.  The Utility\u2019s updated CVA will be used to inform changes to design and construction standards for equipment and facilities to increase infrastructure resilience to current and future extreme weather conditions.  Results from the updated CVA will be incorporated into the Utility\u2019s key risk and planning functions, as well as asset management strategy, to identify priority adaptive actions.   21 21 21    The Utility is also engaging with CPUC-designated disadvantaged and vulnerable communities throughout the CVA process to ensure that customer perspectives regarding energy system resilience are part of updating the CVA.  The Utility is conducting regional community engagement campaigns throughout its service area to understand how some of the most vulnerable communities the Utility serves think about climate hazards and adaptation.  This information will help the Utility plan adaptive climate action aligned with customer and community perspectives.  In addition to updating the CVA, the Utility regularly reviews relevant scientific literature regarding climate change to incorporate appropriate information into its operations.  For example, based on a recent report about potential major atmospheric river events, the Utility updated and modified its flooding emergency response plan.  The Utility\u2019s commitment to increasing resilience to climate change includes aligning its resources and business strategy with California\u2019s clean energy goals, the Utility\u2019s climate strategy, and advocating for policies and programs that enable safe and reliable energy for the Utility\u2019s customers in light of climate change.  For example, the Utility believes its strategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency and demand response programs, infrastructure improvements, and the use of renewable energy and energy storage will help it adapt to the expected increases in demand for electricity.    Emissions Data   PG&E Corporation and the Utility track and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas.  The Utility reports its GHG emissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis.  On a voluntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The Climate Registry, a non-profit organization.  The Utility\u2019s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2021, which is the most recent data available, totaled Scope 1 and 2 emissions of approximately 4.6 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (MMT CO2e) and Scope 3 emissions of approximately 42 MMT CO2e, the majority of which came from customer natural gas use.  The following table shows the 2021 GHG emissions data the Utility reported to the CARB, which is the most recent data available.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility also publish additional GHG emissions data in their annual Corporate Sustainability Report.SourceAmount (metric tons CO2 equivalent)Fossil fuel-fired plants (1)2,485,379\u00a0Natural gas compressor stations and storage facilities (2)322,047\u00a0Distribution fugitive natural gas emissions 589,343\u00a0Customer natural gas use (3)41,563,483\u00a0 Amount (metric tons CO2 equivalent) Fossil fuel-fired plants (1) Natural gas compressor stations and storage facilities (2) Customer natural gas use (3) (1) Includes nitrous oxide and methane emissions from the Utility\u2019s generating stations. (2) Includes emissions from compressor stations and storage facilities that are reportable to CARB. (3) Includes emissions from the combustion of natural gas delivered to all entities on the Utility\u2019s distribution system, with the exception of gas delivered to other natural gas local distribution companies.  The Utility utilized the CEC\u2019s Power Source Disclosure program methodology to calculate the CO2 emissions rate associated with the electricity delivered to retail customers in 2021.  This resulted in a third-party verified CO2 emissions rate of 99 pounds of CO2 per MWh.  Air Emissions Data for Utility-Owned Generation  In addition to GHG emissions data provided above, the table below sets forth information about the air emissions from the Utility\u2019s owned generation facilities.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility also publish air emissions data in their annual Corporate Sustainability Report.20212020Total NOx emissions (tons)139\u00a0141\u00a0NOx emissions rate (pounds/MWh)0.010.01Total SO2 emissions (tons)14\u00a015\u00a0SO2 emissions rate (pounds/MWh)0.001\u00a00.001\u00a0 Total SO2 emissions (tons) SO2 emissions rate (pounds/MWh)  22 22 22   Nuclear Fuel Disposal  Nuclear power plant operations produce gaseous, liquid, and solid radioactive wastes, which are covered by federal regulation.  High-level radioactive wastes primarily include used nuclear fuel.  Low-level waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools, and equipment contaminated through use.  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contracts under which the DOE would be required to dispose of the utilities\u2019 spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by the utilities\u2019 customers.  The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility\u2019s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired nuclear facility at Humboldt Bay.  As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry cask storage facilities to store its spent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon and at Humboldt Bay until the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel.  The Utility and other nuclear power plant owners sued the DOE to recover the costs that they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel.  In September 2012, the DOJ and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that provided a claims process by which the Utility submits annual requests for reimbursement of its ongoing spent fuel storage costs.\u00a0 The claim for the period June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022, totaled approximately $10.5 million and is under review by the DOE.\u00a0 Amounts reimbursed by DOE are refunded to customers through rates.  Considerable uncertainty continues to exist regarding when and whether the DOE will meet its contractual obligation to the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.   Ratemaking Mechanisms  The Utility operates under a \u201ccost-of-service\u201d ratemaking model, which means that rates for electric and natural gas utility services are generally set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service and to earn a return on invested capital (\u201ccost-of-service ratemaking\u201d).  In order to set rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the amount that the Utility will be authorized to collect from its customers (\u201crevenue requirements\u201d).  In the GRC proceedings, the CPUC also generally approves the level of capital spending on a forecasted basis.  Revenue authorized by the CPUC through GRC proceedings is intended to provide the Utility a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its investments in generation and distribution assets and general plant (also referred to as \u201crate base\u201d).  The Utility\u2019s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set to enable the Utility to recover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, administration and general expenses) and capital costs (e.g., depreciation, and financing expenses).   The Utility\u2019s costs of equity and long-term debt are generally approved in the CPUC\u2019s cost of capital proceedings.  In addition, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to \u201cpass through\u201d to customers (referred to as \u201cUtility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings\u201d in Item 7. MD&A), including its costs to procure electricity and natural gas for customers and to administer public purpose and customer programs.  FERC revenue requirements are set through a FERC-approved formula rate.    The Utility\u2019s rate of return on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings.  Other than certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility\u2019s base revenues are \u201cdecoupled\u201d from its sales volume through certain regulatory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, that are designed to allow the Utility to collect its authorized base revenue requirements regardless of sales volume.  As a result, the Utility\u2019s base revenues are not impacted by fluctuations in sales resulting from, for example, weather or economic conditions.  The Utility\u2019s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as \u201cUtility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings\u201d in Item 7. MD&A) within its authorized base revenue requirements.  Due to the seasonal nature of the Utility\u2019s business and rate design, customer electric bills are generally higher during summer months (May to October) because of higher demand, driven by air conditioning loads.\u00a0 Customer bills related to gas service are generally higher during winter months (November to March) because of higher demand due to heating.  From time to time, the CPUC may use incentive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn additional revenues.  For example, the Utility has earned incentives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.   See \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC proceedings.  23 23 23   Base Revenues  General Rate Cases   The GRC is the primary proceeding in which the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect from customers to recover the Utility\u2019s anticipated costs related to its electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and Utility-owned electric generation operations and return on rate base.  In the past, the CPUC has generally conducted a GRC every three years.  Starting with the 2023 GRC, the CPUC now conducts a GRC every four years that includes the Utility\u2019s costs of its gas transmission and storage facilities.  The CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first year (or \u201ctest year\u201d) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC period (known as \u201cattrition years\u201d).  Attrition year rate adjustments are generally authorized for cost increases related to invested capital and inflation.  Parties in the Utility\u2019s GRC include the Public Advocates Office of the CPUC (formerly known as Office of Ratepayer Advocates or ORA) and TURN, which generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as numerous intervenors that represent other business, community, customer, environmental, and union interests.  For more information about the Utility\u2019s GRC, see \u201cRegulatory Matters - 2023 General Rate Case\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.  Cost of Capital Proceedings  The CPUC periodically conducts a cost of capital proceeding to authorize the Utility\u2019s capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric and natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base.  The CPUC\u2019s cost of capital proceedings generally take place in a consolidated proceeding with California\u2019s other large investor-owned electric and gas utilities.  For more information about the cost of capital proceedings, see \u201cRegulatory Matters - Cost of Capital Proceedings\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.   Electricity Transmission Owner Rate Cases   The FERC determines the amount of authorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in rates in the TO rate case.  In its TO rate cases, the Utility uses a formula rate methodology, which includes an authorized revenue requirement and rate base for a given year but also provides for an annual update of the previous year\u2019s revenue requirement and rates in accordance with the terms of the FERC-approved formula.  Under the formula rate mechanism, transmission revenue requirements are updated to the actual cost of service annually as part of the true-up process.  Differences between amounts collected and determined under the formula rate are either collected from or refunded to customers.  The FERC-approved formula rate will be effective through December 31, 2023.  These FERC-approved rates are included by the CPUC in the Utility\u2019s retail electric rates and by the CAISO in its transmission access charges to wholesale customers.  For more information, see \u201cRegulatory Matters - Transmission Owner Rate Cases\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.  The Utility also recovers a portion of its revenue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs through charges collected under specific contracts with wholesale transmission customers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations.  These wholesale customers are charged individualized rates based on the terms of their contracts.  Program-Specific Memorandum Account and Balancing Account Costs  Periodically, costs arise outside of the CPUC GRC proceedings or that have been deliberately excluded therefrom.  These costs may result from catastrophic events, changes in regulation, new programs, or extraordinary changes in operating practices.  The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in a memorandum account, and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed reasonable.  For instance, these accounts allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire prevention-related costs.  Recovery of the costs tracked in these memorandum accounts in rates requires CPUC authorization in separate proceedings for which the Utility may be unable to predict the outcome.  Alternatively, the Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs related to these non-GRC programs in balancing accounts.  The CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in the balancing accounts on either a \u201cone-way\u201d basis, which typically only allows actual costs to be recovered up to a pre-established cap, or a \u201ctwo-way\u201d basis, which typically allows actual costs to be recovered, and in some cases subject to further CPUC review.  For more information, see \u201cRegulatory Matters - Cost Recovery Proceedings\u201d in Item 7. MD&A and Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  24 24 24   Revenues to Recover Energy Procurement and Other Pass-Through Costs   Electricity Procurement Costs  California IOUs are responsible for procuring electrical capacity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus applicable reserve margins.  The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electric generation resources, including certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resources are the least expensive (i.e., using the principles of \u201cleast-cost dispatch\u201d).  In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of their Bundled Procurement Plans (\u201cBPPs\u201d) based on long-term demand forecasts.  In October 2015, the CPUC approved the Utility\u2019s most recent comprehensive BPP.  It has been revised since its initial approval, and the revised version will remain in effect, subject to any further revisions, until superseded by a subsequent CPUC-approved plan.    California law allows electric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved BPPs without further after-the-fact reasonableness review by the CPUC.  The CPUC may disallow costs associated with electricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC-approved plan or if the CPUC determines that the utility failed to follow the principles of least-cost dispatch.  Additionally, the CPUC may disallow the value of lost generation due to unplanned outages at utility-owned generation facilities.  The Utility recovers its electric procurement costs annually primarily through balancing accounts.  See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility\u2019s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivative instruments, GHG emissions costs, and generation fuel expense, and approves a forecasted revenue requirement.  The CPUC may adjust the Utility\u2019s retail electric rates more frequently if the forecasted aggregate over-collections or under-collections in the Energy Resource Recovery Account, net of bundled service customer Portfolio Allocation Balancing Account balances, exceed five percent of its prior year electric procurement and Utility-owned generation revenues.  The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the procurement transactions recovered in various balancing accounts, including the Energy Resource Recovery Account and the Portfolio Allocation Balancing Account.  The CPUC has approved various power purchase agreements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility\u2019s CPUC-approved BPP, to meet mandatory renewable energy targets, and to comply with RA requirements.  For more information, see \u201cElectric Utility Operations - Electricity Resources\u201d below as well as Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  The Utility is also responsible, as the central procurement entity (\u201cCPE\u201d) for its distribution service area, for seeking to procure the entire amount of required local RA on behalf of all CPUC-jurisdictional LSEs in its distribution service area.  CPUC decisions grant the Utility, acting as CPE, discretion to defer procurement of local resources to the CAISO\u2019s backstop mechanisms if bid costs are deemed unreasonably high.  The Utility, as the CPE, will not be assessed fines or penalties for failing to procure resources to meet the local RA requirements and deferring local procurement to the CAISO backstop mechanism, as long as the CPE exercised reasonable efforts to secure capacity and certain specified requirements are met.  In addition, the Utility, as the CPE, has been ordered or authorized to seek to procure specific local capacity products pursuant to CPUC decisions.  In connection with its CPE function, the Utility is responsible for making compliance demonstrations to the CPUC and the CAISO.  The Utility recovers its administrative and procurement costs associated with its CPE function through a balancing account.  Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility\u2019s forecasted administrative costs related to the CPE function and approves a forecasted revenue requirement associated with the administrative costs.  The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the CPE function, including procurement transactions with terms of five years or less (for which costs incurred in compliance with certain prescribed criteria are deemed reasonable and pre-approved without further after-the-fact reasonableness review).   Procurement transactions with terms exceeding five years are reviewed separately.  The CPUC may disallow costs associated with the CPE function that were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC\u2019s decisions and guidance.  The CPUC has also approved the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (\u201cPCIA\u201d).  The PCIA is a cost recovery mechanism to ensure that customers who switch from the Utility\u2019s bundled service to a non-Utility provider, such as a DA or CCA provider, pay their share of the above market costs associated with long-term power purchase commitments and Utility-owned generation made on their behalf.   Natural Gas Procurement, Storage, and Transportation Costs  The Utility recovers the cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail electric rates.  25 25 25   The Utility sets the natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as \u201ccore\u201d customers) monthly, based on the forecasted costs of natural gas, core pipeline capacity and storage costs.  The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost of derivative instruments for its core gas portfolio, through its retail gas rates, subject to limits as set forth in its CPIM described below.  The Utility reflects the difference between actual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancing accounts, with under-collections and over-collections taken into account in subsequent monthly rate changes.    The CPIM protects the Utility against after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs for its core gas portfolio.  Under the CPIM, the Utility\u2019s natural gas purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-based benchmark based on a weighted average of published monthly and daily natural gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural gas.  Costs that fall within a tolerance band, which is 99% to 102% of the commodity benchmark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered through rates.  One-half of the costs above 102% of the benchmark are recoverable through rates, and the Utility\u2019s customers receive in their rates 80% of any savings resulting from the Utility\u2019s cost of natural gas that is less than 99% of the benchmark.  The Utility retains the remaining amount of these savings as incentive revenues, subject to a cap equal to 1.5% of total natural gas commodity costs.  While this mechanism remains in place, changes in the price of natural gas, consistent with the market-based benchmark, are not expected to materially impact net income.  The Utility incurs transportation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers.  These providers transport natural gas from the points at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States) to the points at which the Utility\u2019s natural gas transportation system begins.\u00a0 These agreements are governed by the FERC-approved tariffs that detail rates, rules, and terms of service for the provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines.  The FERC approves the United States tariffs that shippers, including the Utility, pay for pipeline service, and the applicable Canadian tariffs are approved by the National Energy Board, a Canadian regulatory agency.  The transportation costs the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gas procurement costs or as a cost of electricity.  Costs Associated with Public Purpose and Customer Programs  The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utility customers.\u00a0 These programs relate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters. \u00a0Additionally, the CPUC has authorized the Utility to provide discounted rates for specified types of customers, such as for low-income customers under the CARE program, which is paid for by the Utility\u2019s other customers.  Nuclear Decommissioning Costs  The Utility\u2019s nuclear power facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires the safe removal of nuclear facilities from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the property for unrestricted use.  Nuclear decommissioning costs are generally collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.  The Utility files an application with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of the Utility\u2019s updated estimated decommissioning costs and any rate change necessary to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission the Utility\u2019s nuclear plants.  If the nuclear decommissioning trusts are overfunded, the amount of such overfunding will be returned to customers.  Pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section 8325, to the extent the monies available for decommissioning are insufficient to pay for all reasonable and prudent decommissioning costs, the CPUC must authorize the electric utility to collect these charges from its customers.     For costs related to AROs see \u201cAsset Retirement Obligations\u201d in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  26 26 26    Human Capital  Employees and Contractors  As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation had 10 employees and the Utility had approximately 26,000 regular employees.  Of the Utility\u2019s regular employees, approximately 16,000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the local chapters of three labor unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (\u201cIBEW\u201d) Local 1245; the Engineers and Scientists of California (\u201cESC\u201d) IFPTE 20; and the Service Employees International Union Local 24/7 (\u201cSEIU\u201d).  The collective bargaining agreements in effect for the IBEW Local 1245; ESC Local 20; and SEIU, United Service Workers West will expire on December 31, 2025.  The agreements increase wages annually by 3.75% from 2022 through 2025 and maintain current contributions to specified benefits.  The IBEW, ESC, and SEIU represent approximately 62% of the Utility\u2019s employee workforce and support several areas of the Utility\u2019s business, including gas and electric operations.  The Utility enjoys stable and productive relationships with its unions and did not experience any work stoppages in 2022.    PG&E Corporation\u2019s employees are primarily at the executive management level, which experienced significant employee turnover throughout the course of its Chapter 11 Cases in 2019 and 2020.  The Utility generally has a stable workforce, which translated into low voluntary turnover during that period.  The Utility\u2019s turnover rates for 2022 and 2021 were 7.1% and 5.8%, respectively.  Approximately 42% of PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s employees have a tenure of more than 10 years, with an average tenure of 11 years.  Approximately 19% of PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s employees are eligible to retire.  (PG&E Corporation and the Utility define retirement age as 55 years and older.)  The Utility\u2019s contractors and subcontractors include approximately 42,000 individuals from approximately 1,200 contractor companies.  Human Capital Management  PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s human capital resource objectives are to build and retain an engaged, well trained, diverse, and equitable workforce.  PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s Boards of Directors are responsible for overseeing management\u2019s development and execution of PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s human capital strategy.    To build employee engagement, the Utility has a variety of both executive-level and employee-led initiatives and programs.  PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s executive teams meet regularly to discuss and evaluate the state of employee talent, determine which programs are driving engagement and performance, and clarify the specific skills, behaviors, and values that should be cultivated.  Each year, the Utility honors employees whose work embodies safety, diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, environmental leadership, and community service.  The Utility conducts an annual employee engagement survey to measure and improve employee engagement progress.  Every year, PG&E Corporation and the Utility offer or require technical, leadership, and employee training, which includes a range of technical training for employees on the knowledge and skills required to perform their jobs safely using approved tools and work procedures.  In addition, employees are required to complete an annual compliance and ethics training and a Code of Conduct training, both of which are intended to promote a culture in which employees are encouraged to speak up with any concerns or ideas for continuous improvement.  In addition, the Utility offers a variety of other trainings and education opportunities.  Among other programs, the Utility provides career opportunities through its PowerPathway\u2122 workforce development program.  Launched in 2008, PowerPathway is a workforce development model to enlarge the talent pool of local, qualified, diverse candidates for skilled craft and utility industry jobs through training program partnerships with educational, community-based and government organizations.  PowerPathway helps people throughout the Utility\u2019s service area, including women and military veterans, prepare and compete for high demand jobs in the utility and energy industry.  Students receive approximately eight weeks of industry-informed curriculum to ensure the academic, job specific, employability skills and physical training necessary to effectively compete for entry-level employment.  Programs may also include hands-on training and on-the-job training.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility also provide integrated solutions and programs that cover employee health and wellness and that encompass physical, emotional, and financial health, including an on-site health clinic, an annual health screening, and health management tools and resources, in addition to more traditional programs.  27 27 27   PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial incentives offered to employees include a Short-Term Incentive Plan (\u201cSTIP\u201d), an at-risk part of employee compensation designed to reward eligible employees for achieving specific performance goals.  The 2022 STIP was focused on company objectives of safety, customer impact, and financial health.  All PG&E Corporation and Utility officer compensation currently is funded by shareholders.  Safety  The Utility\u2019s strategy to deliver on safety outcomes focuses on workforce, and public safety.  In 2023, in addition to deploying the safety management system, the Utility targets mitigations to the highest risk work.  The Utility\u2019s safety metrics include the number of SIF-A incidents and the SIF-P rate, which measures events that could have resulted in a SIF-A per 200,000 hours worked.  In 2022, the Utility had seven SIF-A incidents, which resulted in three fatalities and four serious injuries, and a SIF-P rate of 0.11.  Additionally, the Utility measures DART.  In 2022, the Utility\u2019s DART was 0.67, which was 34% lower than in 2021 and its lowest rate in the past five years.  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have continued to monitor activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have updated their protocols and actions in accordance with guidance from these organizations, following state and local health and safety regulations, and in consultation with the Utility\u2019s medical director.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also remained focused on protecting the health and safety of their employees, contractors and the Utility\u2019s customers, while continuing to perform critical utility work, and have continued to monitor and track the impact of the pandemic, modifying or adopting new policies in support of their employees\u2019 health and safety as pandemic conditions and governmental response have changed.    Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging  PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s goal is to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment that enables all of their coworkers to bring their best selves to work so that they can provide exceptional customer service.  These efforts are led by PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s Executive Vice President, People, Shared Services and Supply Chain, with support from the executive team.  The People and Compensation Committee of PG&E Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors reviews the companies\u2019 diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging practices and performance.    Key elements of PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s approach include active programming to heighten cultural competency, encourage understanding and appreciation of diversity, and integrate thoughtful content into training and performance support materials.  Additionally, the Utility\u2019s 11 Employee Resource Groups and three Engineering Network Groups execute enterprise-wide available programming, certain coworkers lead efforts within their departments, and other specialized teams facilitate dialogue across the companies.  These efforts foster employee belonging and support an environment of inclusion that values and respects diversity in the workforce.   In 2022, women, minorities, and military veterans accounted for approximately 26%, 49% and 7%, respectively, of total PG&E Corporation and Utility employees.  Approximately 8% of the Utility\u2019s employees are younger than 30, 62% are between the ages of 30 and 49, and 30% are 50 or older.   Electric Utility Operations  The Utility generates electricity and provides electric transmission and distribution services throughout its service area in northern and central California to residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers.  The Utility provides electricity, transmission and distribution services in its service area.  Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generation resources, such as rooftop solar installations.  For more information, see \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.  Electricity Resources  The Utility is required to maintain adequate capacity to meet its customers\u2019 demand for electricity (\u201cload\u201d), including peak demand and planning and operating reserves, deliverable to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service.  The Utility is responsible for scheduling and bidding electric generation resources, including certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand.  28 28 28   The following table shows the percentage of the Utility\u2019s estimated total net deliveries of electricity to customers in 2022 represented by each major electric resource, and further discussed below.  The Utility\u2019s deliveries were primarily from renewable energy resources that qualify under California\u2019s RPS and other GHG-free resources (i.e., nuclear, and large hydroelectric generation).  California\u2019s RPS requirements and SB 100 goal to serve 100% of retail electricity sales with GHG-free resources by 2045 are discussed further below and in the Environmental Regulation section above.  The total estimated electricity generated, procured, and sold (net), as of December 31, 2022 was 30,307 GWh (1) and comprised of the following:Percent of customer retail sales (estimated procurement)CEC reporting methodology adjustment(2) Percent of customer retail sales (estimated Power Content Label) (2)Owned generation facilitiesRenewable (3)2\u00a0%\u2014\u00a0%2\u00a0%Nuclear49\u00a0%\u2014\u00a0%49\u00a0%Large hydroelectric7\u00a0%\u2014\u00a0%7\u00a0%Fossil fuel-fired (4)18\u00a0%(16)%2\u00a0%\u00a0\u00a0Total76\u00a0%(16)%60\u00a0%Third-party purchase agreementsRenewable (3)38\u00a0%\u2014\u00a0%38\u00a0%Large hydroelectric\u2014\u00a0%\u2014\u00a0%\u2014\u00a0%Fossil fuel-fired (4)16\u00a0%(14)%2\u00a0%Total54\u00a0%(14)%40\u00a0%Others, net (2)(5)(30)%30\u00a0%\u2014\u00a0%TOTAL100\u00a0%\u2014\u00a0%100\u00a0%Total renewable energy resources (3)40\u00a0%\u2014\u00a0%40\u00a0%GHG-free resources (6)96\u00a0%\u2014\u00a0%96\u00a0% CEC reporting methodology adjustment(2)  Percent of customer retail sales (estimated Power Content Label) (2) Renewable (3) Fossil fuel-fired (4) Renewable (3) Fossil fuel-fired (4) Others, net (2)(5) Total renewable energy resources (3) GHG-free resources (6) (1) This amount excludes electricity provided by DA providers and CCAs that procure their own supplies of electricity for their respective customers. (2) The allocation of \u201cOthers, net\u201d in the \u201cCEC Reporting Methodology Reduction\u201d and \u201cPower Content Label\u201d columns is consistent with CEC guidelines, applied to specified electric generation and procurement volumes (i.e., fossil fuel-fired, nuclear, large hydroelectric, and renewable).  Total reported generation and procurement volumes equate to actual electric retail sales. (3) Amounts include biopower (e.g., biogas, biomass), solar, wind, certain hydroelectric (i.e., 30MW or less), and geothermal facilities.  The eligible renewable percentages above do not reflect RPS compliance, which is determined using a different methodology. (4) Amounts consist primarily of natural gas facilities. (5) Amount is mainly comprised of net CAISO open market (sales)/purchases. (6) Amount is comprised of renewable, nuclear, and large hydroelectric facility resources generated, procured, and sold.  Renewable Energy Resources  California law established an RPS that requires LSEs, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to their customers.  SB 350 increased the amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most LSEs, including the Utility, to their customers from 33% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period, to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028-2030 compliance period, and in each three-year compliance period thereafter, unless changed by legislative action.  SB 350 provides compliance flexibility and waiver mechanisms, including increased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future compliance periods.  In September 2018, the California Governor signed SB 100 into law, increasing from 50% to 60% of California\u2019s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030; and established state policy that 100% of all retail electricity sales must come from RPS-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045.  The Utility may in the future incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets, which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable through rates as \u201cpass-through\u201d costs.  The Utility also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets.    29 29 29   Renewable generation resources, for purposes of the RPS requirements, include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW or less), wind, solar, and geothermal energy.  RPS requirements are based on procurement, which aligns with the methodology presented in the first column of the table above.  Procurement from renewable energy sources was estimated to comprise 40% of total annual retail sales in 2022.    The estimated total renewable deliveries as of December 31, 2022, shown above was 12,163 GWh and comprised of the following:TypePercent of Customer Retail Sales (estimated procurement)(1) (2) Biopower5\u00a0%Geothermal\u2014\u00a0%RPS-Eligible Small Hydroelectric2\u00a0%Solar24\u00a0%Wind9\u00a0%Total40\u00a0% Percent of Customer Retail Sales (estimated procurement)(1) (2)  (1) Estimated renewable procurement amounts are expected to be consistent with Power Content Label reporting and adjustments, based on current CEC guidelines. (2) Estimated renewable procurement percentages above and renewable compliance percentages are expected to be consistent; however, final RPS compliance reporting is subject to a different methodology and may result in some differences between the two percentages.  Energy Storage   Energy storage improves system reliability and supports California\u2019s decarbonization goals by integrating increased levels of renewable energy.  The CPUC has established a multi-year energy storage procurement framework, under which the Utility was required to procure 580 MW of qualifying storage capacity by the end of 2020, with all energy storage projects required to be operational by the end of 2024.  As of December 31, 2022, the Utility was on track to meet its storage goals by the end of 2024.  Additionally, the Utility has been actively procuring energy storage to meet critical reliability needs.  The CPUC previously approved more than 1,100 MW of storage to come online in 2022 and 2023.  In January 2022, the Utility also requested CPUC approval for another 1,600 MW of storage to be completed by the summer of 2024, which would bring the Utility\u2019s total energy storage system capacity to more than 3,330 MW.  Finally, the Utility is soliciting 200 MW of long-duration storage, which is storage with at least eight hours of discharge capacity, to have these resources online between 2026 and 2028.  Owned Generation Facilities   At December 31, 2022, the Utility owned the following generation facilities, all located in California, listed by energy source and further described below:Generation TypeCounty LocationNumber of UnitsNet Operating Capacity (MW)Nuclear (1): \u00a0\u00a0Diablo CanyonSan Luis Obispo2\u00a02,240\u00a0Hydroelectric (2): \u00a0\u00a0Conventional16 counties in northern and central California99\u00a02,645\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Helms pumped storageFresno3\u00a01,212\u00a0Fossil fuel-fired: \u00a0\u00a0Colusa Generating StationColusa1\u00a0657\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gateway Generating Station Contra Costa1\u00a0580\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Humboldt Bay Generating StationHumboldt10\u00a0163\u00a0Elkhorn Battery Energy Storage SystemMonterey County1\u00a0183\u00a0Photovoltaic (3):Various13\u00a0152\u00a0Total130\u00a07,832\u00a0 Nuclear (1):  Hydroelectric (2):  Photovoltaic (3): (1) The Utility\u2019s Diablo Canyon power plant consists of two nuclear power reactor units, Units 1 and 2.

(2) The Utility\u2019s hydroelectric system consists of 102 generating units at 63 powerhouses.  All of the Utility\u2019s powerhouses are licensed by the FERC (except for two small powerhouses not subject to the FERC\u2019s licensing requirements), with license terms between 30 and 50 years. 30 30 30   (3) The Utility\u2019s large photovoltaic facilities are Cantua solar station (20 MW), Five Points solar station (15 MW), Gates solar station (20 MW), Giffen solar station (10 MW), Guernsey solar station (20 MW), Huron solar station (20 MW), Stroud solar station (20 MW), West Gates solar station (10 MW), and Westside solar station (15 MW).  All of these facilities are located in Fresno County, except for Guernsey solar station, which is located in Kings County.  The Utility has applied to transfer its non-nuclear generation assets to Pacific Generation and potentially sell a minority interest in Pacific Generation.  (For more information, see \u201cApplication with Pacific Generation LLC for Approval to Transfer Non-Nuclear Generation Assets\u201d in Item 7. MD&A below.)  Generation Resources from Third Parties   The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity, including agreements for renewable energy resources, in accordance with its CPUC-approved procurement plan.  See \u201cRatemaking Mechanisms\u201d above.  For more information regarding the Utility\u2019s power purchase agreements, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  Electricity Transmission  As of December 31, 2022, the Utility owned approximately 18,000 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500 kV.  The Utility also operated 33 electric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 65,000 MVA.  The Utility\u2019s electric transmission system is interconnected with electric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which includes many western states, the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, and parts of Mexico.  Decisions about expansions and maintenance of the transmission system can be influenced by decisions of the Utility\u2019s regulators and the CAISO.   Electricity Distribution  The Utility\u2019s electric distribution network consists of approximately 108,000 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 25% are underground and approximately 75% are overhead), 67 transmission switching substations, and 752 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 36,000 MVA.  The Utility\u2019s distribution network interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations, where equipment reduces the high-voltage transmission voltages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility\u2019s customers.  These distribution substations serve as the central hubs for the Utility\u2019s electric distribution network.  Emanating from each substation are primary and secondary distribution lines connected to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users.  In some cases, the Utility sells electricity from its distribution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity.  The Utility operates electric distribution control center facilities in Concord, Rocklin, and Fresno, California; these control centers form a key part of the Utility\u2019s efforts to create a smarter, more resilient grid.  31 31 31   Electricity Operating Statistics   The following table shows certain of the Utility\u2019s operating statistics from 2020 to 2022 for electricity sold or delivered, including the classification of revenues by type of service.

Natural Gas Utility Operations  The Utility provides natural gas transportation services to \u201ccore\u201d customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to \u201cnon-core\u201d customers (i.e., industrial, large commercial, and natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility\u2019s gas system in its service area.\u00a0 Core customers can purchase natural gas procurement service (i.e., natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party gas procurement service providers (referred to as \u201ccore transport agents\u201d).\u00a0 When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gas delivery, metering, and billing services to customers.\u00a0\u00a0When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combined service as \u201cbundled\u201d natural gas service.\u00a0 More than 96% of core customers, representing approximately 85% of the annual core market demand, receive bundled natural gas service from the Utility.  The Utility generally does not provide procurement service to non-core customers, which must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers, unless the customer is a natural gas-fired generation facility with which the Utility has a power purchase agreement that includes its generation fuel expense.  The Utility offers backbone gas transmission, gas delivery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-core customers.\u00a0 Access to the Utility\u2019s backbone gas transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.\u00a0 The Utility also delivers gas to off-system customers (i.e., outside of the Utility\u2019s service area) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.  32 32 32   Natural Gas Supplies  The Utility can receive natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States.  The Utility can also receive natural gas from fields in California.  The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core customers directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States.  The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility\u2019s portfolio of natural gas purchase contracts have varied generally based on market conditions.  During 2022, the Utility purchased approximately 296,000 MMcf of natural gas (net of the sale of excess supply of gas).  Substantially all of this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less.  The Utility\u2019s largest individual supplier represented approximately 47% of the total natural gas volume the Utility purchased during 2022.  Natural Gas System Assets  The Utility owns and operates an integrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California.  At December 31, 2022, the Utility\u2019s natural gas system consisted of approximately 44,000 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6,300 miles of backbone and local transmission pipelines, and various storage facilities.  The Utility owns and operates eight natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system and one compressor station on its local transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility\u2019s pipelines.  The Utility\u2019s backbone transmission system is used to transport gas from the Utility\u2019s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, and California gas fields to the Utility\u2019s local transmission and distribution systems.  The Utility has firm transportation agreements for the transportation of natural gas from various natural gas supply points and interconnection points to the Utility\u2019s natural gas transportation system.  These agreements provide transportation service from western Canada to the United States-Canada border, from the United States-Canada border to an interconnection point with the Utility\u2019s natural gas transportation system at the Oregon-California border, from the U.S. Rocky Mountains to an interconnection point with the Utility\u2019s natural gas transportation system at the Oregon-California border, and from supply points in the southwestern United States to interconnection points with the Utility\u2019s natural gas transportation system in the area of California near Topock, Arizona.  (For more information regarding the Utility\u2019s natural gas transportation agreements, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility owns and operates three underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to the Utility\u2019s gas transmission system.\u00a0 In 2019, the CPUC approved the discontinuation, through closure or sale, of operations at two of the Utility\u2019s owned and operated gas storage fields, Pleasant Creek and Los Medanos.  The Utility expects to sell Pleasant Creek in 2023 in accordance with the CPUC\u2019s final decision in the 2019 GT&S rate case.  The Utility intends to retain the Los Medanos field to further support system supply reliability as proposed in the 2023 GRC.  The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields for storage and later for withdrawal.\u00a0 In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility\u2019s Northern California gas transmission system.   In 2022, the Utility continued upgrading transmission pipeline to allow for the use of in-line inspection tools and substantially completed its work on the final recommendation from the NTSB\u2019s 2010-11 San Bruno investigation to confirm testing or perform a hydrostatic test for all Class 3 and Class 4 pipelines and all high consequence pipeline mileage.    33 33 33   Natural Gas Operating Statistics  The following table shows the Utility\u2019s operating statistics from 2020 through 2022 (excluding subsidiaries) for natural gas, including the classification of revenues by type of service.

Competition  Trends in Market Demand and Competitive Conditions in the Electricity Industry  The Utility expects customer electric load to increase in coming years primarily as a result of electrification of buildings and transportation.  The Utility is not able to predict how quickly this electrification will occur.  The Utility expects customer demand for gas to decrease in the coming years, primarily in response to policies supporting California\u2019s climate goals.  California law allows qualifying non-residential electric customers of IOUs to purchase electricity from energy service providers rather than from the utilities up to certain annual limits specified for each utility.  This arrangement is known as DA.  In addition, California law permits cities, counties, and certain other public agencies that have qualified to become a CCA to generate or purchase electricity for their local residents and businesses.  By law, a CCA can procure electricity for all of its residents and businesses that do not affirmatively elect to continue to receive electricity generated or procured by a utility.  The Utility continues to provide transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to DA customers at the election of their energy service provider.  The CCA customers continue to obtain transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services from the Utility.  In addition to collecting charges for transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services that it provides, the Utility is able to collect charges intended to recover the generation-related costs that the Utility incurred on behalf of DA and CCA customers while they were the Utility\u2019s customers.  The Utility remains the electricity provider of last resort for these customers.  Section 387 of the Public Utilities Code allows for a request to transfer the responsibilities of the provider of last resort obligation from IOUs to other entities.     34 34 34   The Utility is also impacted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage.  The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and customer enrollment in NEM, which allows self-generating customers employing qualifying renewable resources to receive bill credits at the full retail rate, are increasing, putting upward rate pressure on remaining customers.  New NEM customers, as well as customers interconnecting on the successor to the NEM tariffs, are required to pay an interconnection fee, utilize time of use rates, and are required to pay certain non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay.  Significantly higher bills for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energy providers or adopt self-generation technologies.  See \u201cRising rates for the Utility\u2019s customers could result in circumstances in which the Utility is unable to fully recover costs or earn its authorized ROE\u201d in Item 1A. Risk Factors and \u201cRegulatory Matters - OIR to Revisit Net Energy Metering Tariffs\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.   Further, in some circumstances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts may have authority under the state constitution or state statute to provide retail electric service directly to consumers.  Those entities may rely upon FERC open access tariffs and Utility infrastructure to deliver energy to them at wholesale rates for resale at retail to existing or potential new Utility customers.  These entities may also seek to acquire the Utility\u2019s transmission or distribution facilities through eminent domain for use in serving electricity at retail to existing or potential new Utility customers.  As a result, the Utility could lose customers (residential, commercial, and industrial) in the municipality.  See \u201cJurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility\u2019s assets through eminent domain\u201d in Item 1A. Risk Factors.  It is also expected that some publicly-owned utilities will build new or duplicate transmission or distribution facilities to serve existing or potential new Utility customers.  In some instances, microgrid formation is a key factor in a community\u2019s choice to engage governmental entities.   The effect of such types of retail competition generally is to reduce the number of utility customers, leading to a reduction in the Utility\u2019s rate base.  The Utility also competes for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission facilities within, or interconnected to, its service area through a competitive bidding process managed by the CAISO.   For risks in connection with increasing competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Competition in the Natural Gas Industry  The Utility competes with other natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis of transportation rates, access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services.  The Utility also competes for storage services with other third-party storage providers, primarily in Northern California.  ", "time": "00:00:07"}
