This goal includes not only emissions from owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term PPAs and from the MISO energy market. In June\u00a02022, Consumers received approval of its 2021\u00a0IRP, which updated its Clean Energy Plan. With these updates, Consumers expects to meet 90\u00a0percent of its customers\u2019 needs with clean energy sources by 2040 through execution of its plan, which calls for replacing its coal-fueled generation predominantly with investment in renewable energy. New technologies and carbon offset measures including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, methane emission capture, forest preservation, and reforestation may be used to close the gap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Specifically, the Clean Energy Plan provides for the retirement of the D.E.\u00a0Karn coal-fueled generating units in 2023 and the J.H.\u00a0Campbell coal-fueled generating units in 2025.

During 2022, 29\u00a0percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its coal-fueled generating units, which burned six\u00a0million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 10,217\u00a0GWh of electricity. In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. 23 23 23 Table of Contents Table of Contents At December\u00a031,\u00a02022, Consumers had future commitments to purchase coal through 2024; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $104\u00a0million. Most of Consumers\u2019 rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices, although some contain market-based pricing. At December\u00a031,\u00a02022, Consumers had 85\u00a0percent of its 2023 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 34-day supply of coal on hand. In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of railcars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers\u2019 generating facilities. Consumers\u2019 coal transportation contracts are future commitments and expire on various dates through 2025; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $428\u00a0million at December\u00a031,\u00a02022. During 2022, 19\u00a0percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its natural gas\u2011fueled generating units, which burned 49\u00a0bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 6,684\u00a0GWh of electricity. In order to obtain the gas it needs for electric generation fuel, Consumers\u2019 electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric wholesale market. For the Jackson and Zeeland plants, Consumers utilizes an agent that owns firm transportation rights to each plant to purchase gas from the market and transport the gas to the facilities. For units\u00a03\u00a0&\u00a04 of D.E.\u00a0Karn, Consumers holds gas transportation contracts to transport to the plant gas that Consumers or an agent purchase from the market. Electric Utility Competition: Consumers\u2019 electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services. Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers\u2019 service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten\u00a0percent of Consumers\u2019 sales, with certain exceptions. At December\u00a031,\u00a02022, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten\u2011percent limit. Of Consumers\u2019 1.9\u00a0million electric customers, fewer than 300, or 0.02\u00a0percent, purchased electric generation service under the ROA program. For additional information, see Item\u00a07. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Outlook\u2014Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties. Consumers also faces competition or potential competition associated with industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers\u2019 service territory for economic reasons; municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and customer self-generation. Consumers addresses this competition in various ways, including: \u2022aggressively controlling operating, maintenance, and fuel costs and passing savings on to customers \u2022providing renewable energy options and energy waste reduction programs \u2022providing competitive rate-design options, particularly for large energy-intensive customers \u2022offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development \u2022monitoring activity in adjacent geographical areas 24 24 24  Table of Contents Table of Contents Consumers Gas Utility Gas Utility Operations: Consumers\u2019 gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.7\u00a0billion in 2022, $2.1\u00a0billion in 2021, and $1.8\u00a0billion in 2020.

CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers Environmental Strategy and Compliance CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers are committed to protecting the environment; this commitment extends beyond compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Consumers\u2019 Clean Energy Plan details its strategy to meet customers\u2019 long-term energy needs and provides the foundation for its goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. This goal includes not only emissions from owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term PPAs and from the MISO energy market. Consumers expects to meet 90\u00a0percent of its customers\u2019 needs with clean energy sources by 2040 through execution of its Clean Energy Plan, which calls for replacing its coal-fueled generation predominantly with investment in renewable energy. New technologies and carbon offset measures including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, methane emission capture, forest preservation, and reforestation may be used to close the gap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. In June\u00a02022, Consumers received approval of its 2021\u00a0IRP, which updated its Clean Energy Plan. With these updates, Consumers will eliminate the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025 and forecasts renewable energy capacity levels of over 60\u00a0percent in 2040.

In addition to Consumers\u2019 efforts to reduce the electric utility\u2019s carbon footprint, it is also making efforts to reduce the gas utility\u2019s methane footprint. Under its Methane Reduction Plan, Consumers has set a goal of net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas delivery system by 2030. Consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80\u00a0percent by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. The remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. For additional information on Consumers\u2019 Methane Reduction Plan, see Item\u00a07.

Insurance CMS\u00a0Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMS\u00a0Energy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS\u00a0Energy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS\u00a0Energy or Consumers renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.  Human Capital CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers employ a highly trained and skilled workforce comprised of union, non\u2011union, and seasonal employees. Presented in the following table are the number of employees of CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers: December\u00a031202220212020CMS\u00a0Energy, including ConsumersFull-time and part-time employees8,560\u00a08,509\u00a08,234\u00a0Seasonal employees1513\u00a0613\u00a0603\u00a0Total employees9,073\u00a09,122\u00a08,837\u00a0ConsumersFull-time and part-time employees8,366\u00a08,314\u00a07,627\u00a0Seasonal employees1513\u00a0613\u00a0603\u00a0Total employees8,879\u00a08,927\u00a08,230\u00a0 Seasonal employees1 Seasonal employees1 1Consumers\u2019 seasonal workforce peaked at 587 employees during 2022, 622 employees during 2021, and 603 employees during 2020. Seasonal employees work primarily during the construction season. 31 31 31 Table of Contents Table of Contents At December\u00a031,\u00a02022, unions represented 41\u00a0percent of CMS\u00a0Energy\u2019s employees and 42\u00a0percent of Consumers\u2019 employees. The UWUA represents Consumers\u2019 operating, maintenance, construction, and customer contact center employees. The USW represents Zeeland plant employees. The UWUA and USW agreements expire in 2025. The safety of employees, customers, and the general public is a priority of CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. On an annual basis, CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers set various safety goals, with their primary measure being the OSHA recordable incident rate. The recordable incident rate was 1.17 in 2022 and 1.54 in 2021. The target recordable incident rate for 2023 is 1.07. Over the last ten\u00a0years, Consumers\u2019 OSHA recordable incident rate has decreased by 34\u00a0percent. Within the utility industry, there is strong competition for rare, high-demand talent, including those related to renewable energy generation, technology, and data analytics. In order to address this competition and to be able to meet their human capital needs, CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers provide compensation and benefits that are competitive with industry peers. Furthermore, CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers have developed a comprehensive talent strategy, the People Strategy, to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. The strategy focuses on three areas, which are summarized below. \u2022Cultivating a Purpose-Driven Culture: This goal is aimed at ensuring all co-workers understand how their work drives CMS\u00a0Energy\u2019s and Consumers\u2019 key strategic goals. CMS\u00a0Energy\u2019s and Consumers\u2019 progress toward a purpose-driven culture is measured through an engagement index and an empowerment index developed from data obtained through an annual employee engagement survey of union and non-union co-workers administered by a third party. For the year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02022, the employee engagement index score, which measures the percentage of employees that feel satisfied with the company, was 71\u00a0percent and ranked in the second quartile of general industry companies. The employee empowerment index score, which measures the percentage of employees that feel the workplace promotes empowerment, was 54\u00a0percent and ranked in the third quartile of general industry companies. The general industry benchmark was created by the third party who administered the survey through a targeted sampling of working adults within the U.S. who work for firms with widely respected reputations. CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers have a goal to achieve a first-quartile empowerment index score by 2030.  \u2022Creating a Breakthrough Employee Experience: A breakthrough employee experience is one that instills pride and ownership in one\u2019s work. To measure progress toward a breakthrough employee experience, CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers measure employees\u2019 satisfaction with people processes, such as performance management and hiring and onboarding new employees. For the year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02022, the employee experience index was 54\u00a0percent; CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers have a goal to achieve a score of 80\u00a0percent by 2030. \u2022Building Skill Sets at Scale: With an overarching goal of ensuring employees have the right skills to succeed, CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers measure progress in this area through achievement of workforce planning and hiring milestones and through a first-time skill attainment index to evaluate the effectiveness of training. CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers develop skill sets in co-workers through a variety of means, including union apprenticeship programs and yearly trainings for newly required skills. In 2021, CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers launched a full-scale development program for leaders to enable robust succession planning and improve employee engagement and empowerment. 32 32 32 Table of Contents Table of Contents This talent strategy allows CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers to shape employees\u2019 experience and enable leaders to coach and develop co-workers, source talent, and anticipate and adjust to changing skill sets in the business environment. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion As a part of their People Strategy, CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers also employ a comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy designed to embed diversity, equity, and inclusion into all aspects of their business. This is done through embedding standards for diversity, equity, and inclusion into all company processes and ensuring these standards are incorporated into all employee experiences. To measure their success, CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers utilize select questions in the annual engagement survey to create a diversity, equity, and inclusion index. For the year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02022, the diversity, equity, and inclusion index score was 72\u00a0percent. CMS\u00a0Energy and Consumers are committed to building an inclusive workplace that embraces the diverse makeup of the communities that they serve.
