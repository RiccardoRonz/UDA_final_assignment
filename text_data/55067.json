Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Leadership. Kellogg Company\u2019s vision is a good and just world where people are not just fed, but fulfilled. Our purpose is creating better days, and a place at the table for everyone, through our trusted food brands. Our vision and purpose are brought to life through Kellogg\u2019s\u00ae Better Days Promise\u2122, our promise to advance sustainable and equitable access to food by addressing the intersection of wellbeing, hunger, sustainability, and equity, diversity and inclusion (ED&I) for 3 billion people by the end of 2030. This work is not new - we\u2019ve been making progress on these topics for many decades and have been reporting our results annually through our ESG report (formerly Corporate Responsibility Report) and other disclosures since 2009. The information contained in our ESG report is not incorporated by reference herein or otherwise made a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also report against the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\u201cSASB\u201d), Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) and Global Reporting Initiative (\"GRI\") reporting frameworks, as well as many other industry disclosures like CDP and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. In 2022, Kellogg\u2019s sustainability performance is within the top 15% of our industry according to the 2022 S&P Global ESG Yearbook, making Kellogg among the world\u2019s highest performing companies.  Our ESG Commitments. Kellogg\u2019s global ESG strategy, Kellogg\u2019s\u00ae Better Days Promise\u2122, is our promise to create 3 billion better days by the end of 2030 (from a 2015 baseline).  Specifically, we are committed to:  \u2022Nourishing 1 billion people with our foods by the end of 2030. \u2022Feeding 375 million people in need by the end of 2030. \u2022Nurturing people and planet, including support for 1 million farmers and workers, including women and smallholders, by the end of 2030. \u2022Ensuring nondiscrimination and ED&I for all employees. This includes our aspirational goals of gender 50/50 parity on a global basis and 25% underrepresented talent at the management level by the end of 2025 in the U.S. \u2022Engaging 1.5 billion people in advocating for sustainable and equitable access to food by the end of 2030. 3 3 3         Climate-Related Disclosure. Climate change and food security are considerations for Kellogg to ensure the long-term health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products. As a plant-based food company, the success of Kellogg Company is dependent on having timely access to high quality, low cost ingredients, water and energy for manufacturing globally. Risks are identified annually through annual reporting and evaluated in the short (<3 years), medium (3 - 6 years) and long terms (>6 years). These natural capital dependencies are at risk of shortage, price volatility, regulation, and quality impacts due to climate change which is assessed as part of Kellogg\u2019s overall enterprise risk management approach. Specific risks including water stress and social accountability are specifically identified and assessed on a regular basis, especially in emerging market expansion that fuels company growth.   Due to these risks, Kellogg has implemented short and long-term initiatives to mitigate and adapt to these environmental pressures, as well as the resulting challenge of food security. While these risks are not currently impacting business growth, they must be monitored, evaluated, and mitigated. The Company has incorporated the risks and opportunities of climate change and food security as part of the Deploy For Growth Strategy and Kellogg\u2019s\u00ae Better Days Promise\u2122 by continuing to identify risk, incorporate sustainability indicators into strategic priorities, and report regularly to leadership, the Board, and publicly. Kellogg has been recognized as a 2021 CDP Supplier Engagement Leader, representing the top 7% of companies who disclosed to the full climate questionnaire.   Oversight. Kellogg Company\u2019s Board of Directors, including its Social Responsibility and Public Policy Committee, oversees our ESG strategy. Our Senior Vice President Chief Global Corporate Affairs Officer, Senior Vice President Global Supply Chain, Senior Vice President Chief Global Human Resources Officer, Senior Vice President Research and Development and other executives who report to the Chairman and CEO, are responsible for successfully implementing the strategy and regularly updating the CEO and Board Committee. Our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) reports to the Senior Vice President Chief Global Corporate Affairs Officer. Additionally, numerous leaders are accountable for achieving specific ESG commitments, based on their roles.   In addition, Kellogg has a Global ESG Council and regional ESG Councils. The Councils ensure execution on priority strategies to maximize ESG performance, share best practices to ensure we are progressing against our commitments. Raw Materials.\u00a0Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, rice, potato flakes, vegetable oils, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard, corrugate, and flexible packaging are the principal packaging materials used by us. We continually monitor world supplies and prices of such commodities (which include such packaging materials), as well as government trade policies. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, changing weather patterns and conditions, climate change, and other supply and/or demand impacting events such as a pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical events, or other unforeseen circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes of our short-term and long-term requirements. The principal ingredients in the products produced by us in the United States include corn and corn grits, wheat and wheat-based ingredients, potato flakes, oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and soybean derivatives, various fruits, sugars and sweeteners, vegetable oils, dairy products, eggs, and other ingredients, which are obtained from various sources. While most of these ingredients are purchased from sources in the United\u00a0States, some materials are imported due to regional availability and specification requirements. We enter into long-term contracts for the materials described in this section and purchase these items on the open market, depending on our view of possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and our relative negotiating power. Despite our ability to source materials necessary to meet increased demand for our products, certain ingredients, packaging and other goods and services have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials and services in the future, we expect supply pressures, supply chain and logistics delays, and other disruptions to continue into 2023. As further discussed herein under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07A, we also use commodity futures and options to hedge some of our costs. Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based operations are available in adequate supply and are sourced both locally and imported from countries other than those where used in manufacturing. Natural gas and propane are the primary sources of energy used to power processing equipment at major domestic and international facilities, although certain locations may use electricity, oil, propane or solar cells as needed. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products.   Trademarks.  Generally, our products are marketed under trademarks we own. Our principal trademarks are our housemarks, brand names, slogans, and designs related to cereals, snacks and various other foods manufactured and marketed by us.

The trademarks listed above, among others, individually and when taken as a whole, are important to our business. Certain individual trademarks are also important to our business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. Seasonality.\u00a0Demand for our products is generally level throughout the year, although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and holidays.  Working Capital.  A description of our working capital is included in the Liquidity section of MD&A within Item\u00a07 of this Report. Customers.\u00a0Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 18% of consolidated net sales during 2022, comprised principally of sales within the United States. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2022.  During 2022, our top five customers, collectively, including Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 32% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 53% of U.S.\u00a0net sales. There has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry and we believe that this trend is likely to continue. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our  5 5 5        products and our relationships with our customers. Our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service establishments. Backlog.\u00a0For the most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders at December\u00a031, 2022 and January\u00a01, 2022 was not material to us. Competition.\u00a0We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products, which are typically distributed at lower prices, and generally with other food products. Principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions, product quality, taste, convenience, nutritional value, price, advertising and promotion. Research and Development.\u00a0Research to support and expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food products is carried on at the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at other locations around the world. Our expenditures for research and development were approximately (in millions): 2022-$127; 2021-$134; 2020-$135.  Information concerning our research and development expense is located in Note 1 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Regulation.\u00a0Our activities in the United States are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United States, including those of the European Union and various countries, states and municipalities, also regulate our activities. Environmental Matters.\u00a0Our facilities are subject to various U.S.\u00a0and foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material proceedings arising under these regulations. We believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position.  Human Capital Resources. On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 30,000 employees. The majority of our employees work on a full-time basis.  We are also party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. Our human capital objectives include attracting, developing, engaging, rewarding and retaining our employees.   Equity, Diversity and Inclusion: In 2005, Kellogg established an Office of Diversity & Inclusion.  Since this time, our Company has enhanced our strategy to lead with Equity and be known as the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. This office has been focused on recruiting and retaining employees, creating awareness of diversity issues, fostering a supportive, positive environment where inclusive behaviors are the norm, and embedding accountability for diversity throughout the organization.  Our goal is to reflect the diversity of our consumers throughout our Company. We report to our Board of Directors on a periodic basis about the actions we have taken to make progress on our ED&I journey, and we are firmly committed to continuing to advance our ED&I priorities. Our focus on equity, diversity and inclusion enables us to build a culture where employees are inspired to share their passion, talents and ideas.  Our eight Business Employee Resource Groups, which include KVets and Supporters, Kellogg Multinational Employee Resource Group, Kellogg\u2019s Young Professionals, Kellogg African American Resource Group, Women of Kellogg, Hola (our Latino resource group), KPride & Allies (our LBGTQ+ resource group), and Kapable (our resource group for people with disabilities and their supporters), also play a critical role in attracting diverse talent, providing mentoring and career development opportunities, delivering commercial business insights and connecting people to the Company and the communities where we do business. Through many initiatives, supported by our Business Employee Resource Groups and ED&I Champions, several leading organizations recognized Kellogg for our commitment to building and supporting equity, diversity and inclusion in our workplace, marketplace and the communities where we work and live. These include Diversity Inc., Social Corporate Equity Index, Diversity Best Practice Index and Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality, to name a few.   Training and Development: We invest in ongoing leadership development through programs such as our Step UP program for future managers, our Accelerate program for experienced managers and our executive leadership training program for developing our future leaders.  Employee Engagement: We communicate frequently and transparently with our employees through a variety of engagement vehicles, from externally managed global opinion surveys to weekly check-ins via our internal global  6 6 6        recognition platform.

Total Rewards: We provide a market-based competitive compensation through our salary, annual incentive and long-term incentive programs, and a benefits package that promotes employee well-being across all aspects of their lives, including physical, financial, social and emotional wellbeing. We sponsor a number of benefit plans for eligible employees in the United States and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension plans, defined contributions retirement plans, retiree health and welfare, active health care, severance and other postemployment benefits.  We continually review and implement new programs around the world to meet the evolving needs of our employees, including, but not limited to benefit programs for same sex partners and progressive leave benefits (e.g., paternity/maternity and active Military). We are also offering flexible work arrangements across our global population.  Health and Wellness: We aim to create a culture where all colleagues feel supported and valued in line with our corporate mission. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to unique challenges and we are striving to ensure the health, safety, and general well-being of our colleagues. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our colleagues\u2019 health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber, and we offer a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration. Our global employee wellbeing framework, \"My Total Health,\" addresses physical, financial, social and emotional wellbeing to support our employees' personal goals. On an ongoing basis, we focus on each aspect of wellbeing and provide useful information, education, tools and resources. In North America, our \u201cFind your Wings\u201d employee assistance program provides  access to valuable Mental Health resources. In addition, our \u201cLean on Me\u201d program trains employees on how to identify other employees that may be struggling with mental health challenges and pointing them towards our available resources. We also provide company paid access to gyms and mindfulness resources in many parts of the world. Most of our locations now use the My Total Health framework to guide how they communicate and engage with employees in support of their wellbeing.    Company Ethics: The Company has processes in place for compliance with the Code of Conduct for Kellogg Company Board of Directors and Global Code of Ethics for Kellogg Company employees, each including a requirement for annual certification that provides employees an opportunity to disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest, report actual or potential violations of the law, the Code or policy and acknowledge their obligation to comply with the applicable code.  The Company regularly re-enforces our commitment to ethics and integrity in employee communications, in our everyday actions and through our processes.  In addition, the Company provides targeted training across the globe during the course of the year. The Company also maintains an ethics related hotline, managed by a third party, through which individuals can anonymously raise concerns or ask questions about business behavior.
