Monoline Excess businesses retain risk solely on an excess basis.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our two reporting segments are each composed of individual businesses that serve a market defined by geography, products, services or industry served. Each of our businesses is positioned close to its customer base and participates in a niche market requiring specialized knowledge. This strategy of decentralized operations allows each of our businesses to identify and respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and specific customer needs, while capitalizing on the benefits of centralized capital, investment and reinsurance management, and corporate actuarial, financial, enterprise risk management and legal staff support.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our business approach is focused on meeting the needs of our customers, maintaining a high quality balance sheet, and allocating capital to our best opportunities. New businesses are started when opportunities are identified and when the right talent and expertise are found to lead a business. Of our 59 businesses, 52 have been organized and developed internally and seven have been added through acquisition.         \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net premiums written, as reported based on United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), for each of our reporting segments for each of the past three years were as follows:   Year Ended December\u00a031,(In thousands)202220212020Net premiums written:Insurance$8,784,146\u00a0$7,743,814\u00a0$6,347,101\u00a0Reinsurance & Monoline Excess 1,219,924\u00a01,119,053\u00a0915,336\u00a0Total$10,004,070\u00a0$8,862,867\u00a0$7,262,437\u00a0Percentage of net premiums written:Insurance87.8\u00a0%87.4\u00a0%87.4\u00a0%Reinsurance & Monoline Excess 12.2\u00a012.6\u00a012.6\u00a0Total100.0\u00a0%100.0\u00a0%100.0\u00a0% Thirty-two of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (\"A.M. Best\") and have financial strength ratings of A+ (Superior) (the second highest rating out of 15 possible ratings). A.M.

An FSR is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk.\u201d A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and its ratings of the Company's subsidiaries are therefore subject to change. Our twenty-three insurance company subsidiaries rated by Standard & Poor's (\u201cS&P\u201d) have financial strength ratings of A+ (the seventh highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings).

A number in excess of 100 indicates an underwriting loss; a number below 100 indicates an underwriting profit: \u00a0Year Ended December 31,\u00a0202220212020Insurance\u00a0\u00a0Loss ratio61.3\u00a0%61.1\u00a0%64.9\u00a0%Expense ratio27.9\u00a028.3\u00a030.3\u00a0Combined ratio89.2\u00a0%89.4\u00a0%95.2\u00a0%Reinsurance & Monoline ExcessLoss ratio61.3\u00a0%61.0\u00a0%61.3\u00a0%Expense ratio28.4\u00a029.7\u00a031.8\u00a0Combined ratio89.7\u00a0%90.7\u00a0%93.1\u00a0%TotalLoss ratio61.3\u00a0%61.1\u00a0%64.5\u00a0%Expense ratio28.0\u00a028.5\u00a030.4\u00a0Combined ratio89.3\u00a0%89.6\u00a0%94.9\u00a0%  Investments Investment results, before income taxes, were as follows: \u00a0Year Ended December\u00a031,(In thousands)\u00a0202220212020Average investments, at cost (1)$24,438,112\u00a0$22,234,975\u00a0$20,012,182\u00a0Net investment income (1)$779,185\u00a0$671,618\u00a0$583,821\u00a0Percent earned on average investments (1)3.2\u00a0%3.0\u00a0%2.9\u00a0%Net investment gains$202,397\u00a0$90,632\u00a0$103,000\u00a0Change in unrealized investment (losses) gains (2)$(1,248,128)$(254,939)$164,645\u00a0 _______________________________________ (1)Includes investments, cash and cash equivalents, trading accounts receivable (payable) from brokers and clearing organizations, trading account securities sold but not yet purchased and unsettled purchases.

Loss and Loss Expense Reserves To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer\u2019s payment of that loss. In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a \u201ccase reserve\u201d for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) to the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided. In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses. These factors include, among others, historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily based on management\u2019s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed. The risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation, increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation. A change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost. While the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time, some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management\u2019s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. These variables are affected by external and internal events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Although the loss reserves included in the Company\u2019s financial statements represent management\u2019s best estimates, setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. 15 15 15    The Company discounts its liabilities for certain workers\u2019 compensation reserves. The amount of workers\u2019 compensation reserves that were discounted was $1,267 million and $1,387 million at December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The aggregate net discount for those reserves, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, was $416 million and $452 million at December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December\u00a031, 2022, discount rates by year ranged from 0.7% to 6.5%, with a weighted average discount rate of 3.4%.  Substantially all discounted workers\u2019 compensation reserves (97% of total discounted reserves at December\u00a031, 2022) are excess workers\u2019 compensation reserves. In order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities, reserves for excess workers\u2019 compensation business are discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period. Once established, no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period, and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate, without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized. The expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the Company\u2019s loss payout experience. \u00a0 The Company also discounts reserves for certain other long-duration workers\u2019 compensation reserves (representing approximately 3% of total discounted reserves at December\u00a031, 2022), including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease. These reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware. To date, known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations, because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language. The Company\u2019s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to environmental and asbestos claims on policies written before adoption of the absolute exclusion was $20 million at both December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021. The estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues, as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.

Reinsurance We follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers. As a result, generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an A.M.\u00a0Best rating of \u201cA (Excellent)\u201d or better with at least $1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an A.M.\u00a0Best rating of \u201cA- (Excellent)\u201d or better with at least $1 billion in policyholder surplus.  Regulation U.S. Regulation\u00a0 Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are principally regulated by their domiciliary state insurance departments and are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the other U.S. jurisdictions in which they do business. As of January 1, 2023, there are six domiciliary states related to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.  Overview. Our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. This regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of certain policy forms and premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes; establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums, loss expenses and losses; and requirements regarding numerous other matters. Our property casualty subsidiaries, other than our excess and surplus lines and reinsurance subsidiaries, must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate. Our excess and  17 17 17    surplus lines and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation.  Legislative and Regulatory Activity Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic.  In response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, legislators in several states and in the United States Congress introduced proposals that would have mandated insurance coverage for certain pandemic-related losses, including business interruption losses, under previously-issued policies that were not designed or priced to provide such coverage. Federal lawmakers also discussed the possibility of a public-private partnership, and there appears to have been a broadly held and bipartisan consensus that pandemic risk is generally uninsurable absent some kind of publicly-funded backstop. While these state and federal proposals have not meaningfully progressed, there remains a risk that they might be revived, or that future variants of COVID-19 or concerns about the possibility of a future pandemic might prompt similar legislative and regulatory proposals. See \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to Our Industry \u2014 The COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected our results of operations, and is expected to continue and therefore may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\u201d  Holding Company Statutes. In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems. Under the terms of applicable state statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage (commonly 10%) of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase. Typically, such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate domiciliary state insurance commissioner, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations.  We must also annually submit to the lead state regulator for our group an \u201centerprise risk management report\u201d which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our U.S. licensed insurers.  In addition, all states have adopted changes to the holding company act that authorize U.S. insurance regulators to lead or participate in the group-wide supervision of certain international insurance groups. In November 2019, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (\u201cIAIS\u201d), an international standard setter, adopted a global framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups, as discussed below under \u201cInternational Regulation.\u201d This framework includes a risk-based, group-wide global insurance capital standard (\u201cICS\u201d), which is undergoing a five-year monitoring period that started in January 2020. In the United States, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the \u201cNAIC\u201d) has developed a group capital calculation tool that uses a risk-based capital aggregation methodology for all entities in an insurance holding company system. The goal is to provide U.S. regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all companies regardless of their structure. In 2020, the NAIC adopted amendments to the model holding company act and regulation that implement the group capital calculation by requiring the ultimate controlling person of an insurer subject to holding company registration to file the group capital calculation with its lead state regulator. The annual filing requirement will become effective once the states have adopted the NAIC holding company amendments. This annual filing requirement became effective in Delaware, our lead state insurance regulator, on February 7, 2022. All states have adopted the NAIC's Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (the \u201cORSA Model Act\u201d), which requires an insurance holding company system\u2019s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report (\u201cORSA Report\u201d). The ORSA Report is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer\u2019s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. Under the ORSA Model Act, as enacted by the states, we are required to: \u2022regularly, no less than annually, conduct an ORSA to assess the adequacy of our risk management framework, and current and estimated projected future solvency position; \u2022internally document the process and results of the assessment; and \u2022provide an ORSA Report annually to the State of Delaware's Insurance Commissioner. Cybersecurity Regulations. New York\u2019s cybersecurity regulation applies to financial services institutions authorized by the New York State Department of Financial Services (the \u201cNYDFS\u201d), including our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York. The regulation requires these entities to assess risks associated with their information systems and establish and maintain a cybersecurity program reasonably designed to protect consumers\u2019 private data and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the licensee\u2019s information systems. In November 2022, the NYDFS proposed amendments to New York\u2019s cybersecurity regulation, which, if adopted, would require additional reporting, governance and oversight measures to be implemented.  18 18 18    The NAIC has adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law (the \u201cCybersecurity Model Law\u201d) for consideration by state legislatures, which, when adopted by the states, establishes standards for data security, the investigation of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain nonpublic information, and reporting to insurance commissioners. The Cybersecurity Model Law imposes significant regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. As of December 31, 2022, the Cybersecurity Model Law, or a form thereof, had been adopted by several states, including three of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries\u2019 domiciliary states. A drafting note in the Cybersecurity Model Law states that a licensee\u2019s compliance with New York's cybersecurity regulation is intended to constitute compliance with the Cybersecurity Model Law, but compliance remains a state-by-state issue and we would need to consider any differences in implementation and enforcement of the Cybersecurity Model Law as part of our compliance efforts. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission amended the \u201cStandards for Safeguarding Customer Information Rules (otherwise known as the \u201cSafeguards Rule\u201d) in 2021 to require covered financial institutions to implement certain data security measures and practices in their information security programs. Many of the requirements of the amended Safeguards Rule are similar to New York's cybersecurity regulation and the Cybersecurity Model Law, but there are some differences that may impose increased operational burdens and compliance costs. The amended Safeguards Rule will become effective in June 2023. Certain other states are also developing or have developed regulations related to privacy and data security. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective in January 2020, broadly regulates the collection, processing and disclosure of California residents\u2019 personal information, imposes limits on the \u201csale\u201d of personal information and grants California residents certain rights to, among other things, access and delete data about them in certain circumstances. The CCPA also established a private right of action, with potentially significant statutory damages, whereby businesses that fail to implement reasonable security measures to protect against breaches of personal information could be liable to affected consumers. California subsequently enacted the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which came into full effect in January 2023. The CPRA amends the CCPA by imposing additional limitations and obligations with respect to covered businesses\u2019 use and sharing of certain personal data. Compliance with the CCPA/CPRA may increase the cost of providing our products and services in California. Other states have considered \u2013 and some states have adopted - similar proposals. For instance, Virginia enacted a data privacy law in 2021 that became effective in January 2023. Additionally, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have enacted data privacy laws that will come into effect later in 2023. These laws establish in those states many of the same data privacy and security requirements as other existing laws, such as the CCPA. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that any current, proposed or future federal or state cybersecurity laws or regulations will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Risk-Based Capital Requirements. The NAIC utilizes a Risk-Based Capital (\u201cRBC\u201d) formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. The NAIC RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the calculated RBC target level as of December\u00a031, 2022.\u00a0 Insurance Regulatory Information System. The NAIC also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios for property and casualty insurers referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (\u201cIRIS\u201d). On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each of the IRIS financial ratios. Guaranty Funds. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds in states where we transact admitted business when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the insolvent company's available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled. The protection afforded under a state's guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state. Generally, all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state. The NAIC Post-Assessment Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act, a version of which has been adopted by all states, limits assessments to 2% of an insurer\u2019s subject premiums and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting. Likewise, several states (or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members) have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business. Additionally, state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory property-liability \u201cshared market,\u201d \u201cpooling\u201d or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers. Shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or \u201cFAIR\u201d plans. In addition, some states require insurers to  19 19 19    participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts. Our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific mechanism in the applicable state.\u00a0 Dividends. We receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\u00a0 Trade Practices. State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. Investment Regulation. Investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications. Investments that do not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries' calculation of their statutory capital and surplus. Terrorism Risk Insurance. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established a Federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. Pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (\u201cTRIPRA\u201d), the program was extended until December 31, 2027. TRIPRA provides a federal backstop to all U.S. based property and casualty insurers for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on U.S. soil or against certain U.S. air carriers, vessels or foreign missions. TRIPRA is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto, burglary and theft, surety, professional liability and farm owners' multi-peril insurance. Insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the United States are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism. TRIPRA's definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism. Federal participation will be triggered under TRIPRA when the Secretary of Treasury certifies an act of terrorism.  Under the program, the federal government will pay 80% of an insurer's covered losses in excess of the insurer's applicable deductible. The insurer's deductible is calculated as 20% of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance. Based on our 2022 earned premiums, our aggregate deductible under TRIPRA during 2023 will be approximately $1,310 million. The federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed $200\u00a0million industry-wide for any calendar year after 2020. TRIPRA limits the federal government's share of losses at $100\u00a0billion for a program year. In addition, an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the $100\u00a0billion cap. Excess and Surplus Lines. The regulation of our U.S.\u00a0subsidiaries' excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business. Our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance. Although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business, principally with respect to rates and policy forms, strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future. Federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future. Climate Change and Financial Risks.  The NAIC and state insurance regulators are evaluating issues related to the topic of climate risk. The NAIC\u2019s goal is to address climate-related risks through three areas of insurance regulation: financial risk analysis; insurance market availability and affordability; and consumer education and outreach. In New York, the NYDFS issued a circular letter in September 2020 that applies to both New York domestic and foreign authorized insurers, such as our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York. The circular letter states that the NYDFS expects these insurers to integrate financial risks related to climate change into their governance frameworks, risk management processes, business strategies and scenario analysis, and develop their approach to climate-related financial disclosure. For example, an insurer should designate a board member or board committee, as well as a senior management function, to oversee the management of financial risks associated with climate change. The NYDFS also adopted an amendment to the regulation governing enterprise risk management, which applies to our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York, that requires an insurance group's enterprise risk management function to address certain additional risks, including climate change risk.    20 20 20    In addition, the Federal Insurance Office (the \u201cFIO\u201d) is authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), as discussed below under \u201cFederal Regulation.\u201d The FIO is assessing how the insurance sector may help mitigate climate-related risks and achieve national climate-related goals.   Diversity and Corporate Governance.The NAIC and state insurance regulators are evaluating issues related to diversity within the insurance industry, such as the diversity of an insurer\u2019s board of directors and management. The NAIC is also examining practices in the insurance industry in order to determine how barriers are created that disadvantage or discriminate against people of color or historically underrepresented groups. On March 16, 2021, the NYDFS issued a circular letter stating that it expects the insurers it regulates, such as our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York, to make diversity of their leadership a business priority and a key element of their corporate governance. See \u201cHuman Capital Resources\u201d below. Federal Regulation. The federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, although federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways. The Dodd-Frank Act effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the United States, and created two new federal government bodies, the FIO and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the \u201cFSOC\u201d). The FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, although it has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements, as discussed below. The FIO also has authority to represent the United States in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act addresses the roles played by federal regulators at international insurance standard-setting forums, and it directs the Director of the FIO and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to support increased transparency at international standard-setting regulatory forums (e.g., the IAIS). These federal regulations also instruct the FIO and the Federal Reserve to achieve consensus positions with the states through the NAIC prior to taking a position on any insurance proposal by a global insurance regulatory forum.   The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury and U.S. Trade Representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance. The U.S. and the European Union (\"EU\") signed such a covered agreement (the \"EU Covered Agreement\") in September 2017. The EU Covered Agreement addresses three areas of prudential supervision: reinsurance, group supervision and the exchange of information between the U.S. and EU. Under the EU Covered Agreement, reinsurance collateral requirements no longer apply to qualifying EU reinsurers that sell reinsurance to the U.S. market, and U.S. reinsurers operating in the EU market are no longer subject to \u201clocal presence\u201d requirements. The EU Covered Agreement establishes group supervision practices that apply only to U.S. and EU insurance groups operating in both territories. For instance, the EU Covered Agreement states that, provided the U.S. has adopted group supervision including worldwide group governance, solvency, capital and reporting, U.S.-headquartered insurance groups with operations in the EU will be supervised at the worldwide level only by U.S. insurance regulators, thereby precluding EU insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of those insurers.  In December 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative entered into a covered agreement with the U.K. (the \u201cU.K. Covered Agreement,\u201d and together with the EU Covered Agreement, the \u201cCovered Agreements\u201d) in anticipation of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU. The U.K. Covered Agreement largely reflects the provisions of the EU Covered Agreement and incorporates the same timeframes within it.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FIO has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with the Covered Agreements as of September 1, 2022, such as state credit for reinsurance laws that result in non-U.S. reinsurers subject to the Covered Agreements being treated less favorably than U.S. reinsurers. The NAIC previously adopted amendments to its Credit for Reinsurance Model Law to satisfy the substantive and timing requirements of the Covered Agreements, which amendments have been enacted by all states. On September 30, 2022, the FIO reported that it did not recommend taking any preemption action as a result of inconsistency between the Covered Agreements and state credit for reinsurance laws, although it is still monitoring state measures implementing the NAIC\u2019s revisions to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law. The FIO plans to publish an update to its preemption report during 2023. The amended Credit for Reinsurance Model Law also extends the zero reinsurance collateral provisions in the Covered Agreements to qualified reinsurers domiciled in U.S. jurisdictions that are accredited by the NAIC and to non-U.S. jurisdictions that have not entered into a covered agreement with the U.S. but which the NAIC has identified as \u201creciprocal jurisdictions\u201d pursuant to the NAIC Qualified Jurisdiction Process.  We cannot currently predict the impact of these changes to the law or whether any other covered agreements will be successfully adopted, and cannot currently estimate the impact of these changes to the law and any such adopted covered agreements on our business, financial condition or operating results. The FIO also can recommend that the FSOC designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the United States\u2019 financial stability in the event of the insurer\u2019s material financial distress or failure, i.e., a \u201csystemically important financial institution\u201d or a \u201cnon-bank SIFI.\u201d An insurer so designated by the FSOC will be subject to Federal Reserve supervision and  21 21 21    heightened prudential standards. There are currently no such non-bank SIFIs designated by the FSOC. The FSOC changed its process for designating non-bank SIFIs, effective in January 2020, by adopting an activities-based approach and moving away from the entities-based approach. Based upon our current business model and balance sheet, we do not believe that we will be designated by the FSOC as such an institution. Although the potential impact of any future amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act on the U.S. insurance industry is not clear, our business could be affected by changes to the U.S. system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically important non-bank financial companies.  International Regulation Our insurance subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom are regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (\u201cPRA\u201d) and/or the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d). The PRA\u2019s primary objectives with regard to insurers are to promote the safety and soundness of insurers and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for current and future policyholders. The FCA has three operational objectives: (i) to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers, (ii) to protect and enhance the integrity of the United Kingdom\u2019s financial system, and (iii) to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets. The PRA and FCA employ a variety of regulatory tools to achieve their objectives, including periodic auditing and reporting requirements, risk assessment reviews, minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements, dividend restrictions, in certain cases, approval requirements governing the appointment of key officers, approval requirements governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements. Our Lloyd\u2019s managing agency is also regulated by Lloyd\u2019s, and the Lloyd\u2019s syndicate business is subject to Lloyd\u2019s supervision. Through Lloyd\u2019s, we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of Lloyd\u2019s international licenses. In each such country, we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country. Our insurance subsidiary based in Liechtenstein is regulated by the Financial Market Authority of Liechtenstein (\"FMA\"), which has regulatory tools analogous to those of the U.K. regulators noted above. Additionally, U.K. and Liechtenstein laws and regulations also impact us as \u201ccontrollers\u201d of our European-regulated subsidiaries, whereby we are required to notify the appropriate authorities about significant events relating to such regulated subsidiaries\u2019 controllers (i.e. persons or entities which have certain levels of direct or indirect voting power or economic interests in the regulated entities) as well as changes of control, and to submit annual reports regarding their controllers. The PRA/FCA\u2019s Senior Managers and Certification Regime and analogous regulation in Liechtenstein further provide regulatory frameworks for standards of fitness and propriety, conduct and accountability for individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers. In addition, certain employees are individually registered at Lloyd\u2019s. Our insurance business throughout the EU and EEA is subject to \u201cSolvency II,\u201d an insurance regulatory regime governing, among other things, capital adequacy and risk management. Following the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, or Brexit, our Lloyd\u2019s managing agency (and the U.K. branch of our Liechtenstein subsidiary) are now subject to a separate U.K. prudential regime, which is broadly identical to Solvency II from January 1, 2021. However, the two regimes are likely to diverge in the near future. The U.K. has undertaken a review of Solvency II and of the regulatory regime applicable to U.K. authorized insurers and reinsurers.  Following this review, on November 17, 2022, the U.K.\u2019s HM Treasury published a finalized package of proposed reforms to the U.K.\u2019s prudential regime, which covers a range of areas including the risk margin, matching adjustment requirements and regulatory reporting obligations. These reforms will be reflected in new U.K. legislation and regulation. Similarly, the European Commission has undertaken its own review of Solvency II and, on September 22, 2021, published a package of proposed legislative reforms for amending the existing regulatory framework. The European Council published its agreed position on the European Commission\u2019s proposed reforms in June 2022, which it is currently negotiating with the European Parliament, although the full extent of the changes will only be known once the package of legislative reforms is finalized.  Solvency II provides for the supervision of group solvency. Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the U.S. company is not already subject to regulations deemed \u201cequivalent\u201d to Solvency II. Currently, the U.S. system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed \u201cequivalent\u201d to Solvency II by European Union authorities. The PRA will also perform separate, but comparable, supervision of group solvency under the U.K.\u2019s own domestic prudential regime where a U.S. holding company is a parent of a subsidiary U.K. insurer or reinsurer. The Liechtenstein financial services regulator, the FMA, is the group supervisor for our European-regulated subsidiaries. However, the Covered Agreements prohibit any EU supervisor or the PRA (as applicable) from exercising group-wide supervision at any level above the highest company organized in the country of that supervisor. We must also comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/879) (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect  22 22 22    in May 2018. The regulation\u2019s goal is to impose increased individual rights and protections for all personal data located in or originating from the EU. The Data Protection Act 2018 and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation, which is the retained EU law version of the GDPR by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (together, \u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d), regulate data protection for all individuals within the U.K. Both the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR are extraterritorial in that they apply to all businesses in the EU and the U.K. respectively and any business outside the EU and the U.K. that process EU and/or U.K. personal data of individuals in the EU and/or the U.K. Moreover, there are significant fines associated with non-compliance. In particular, we need to monitor our compliance with all relevant member states\u2019 laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR are introduced. The introduction of the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR, and any resultant changes in EU member states\u2019 or U.K. national laws and regulations, has increased our compliance obligations and has necessitated the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data, and has required us to change our business practices regarding these matters. In addition, we may become subject to or affected by regulatory policies adopted by the IAIS, an international standard setter consisting of supervisors and regulators from more than 200 jurisdictions. The IAIS has been working on several initiatives to consider changes to insurer solvency standards and group supervision of companies in a holding company system in response to the increasing globalization of the insurance sector. In November 2019, the IAIS formally adopted a global framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups (\u201cIAIGs\u201d), which is referred to as the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups, or \u201cComFrame.\u201d ComFrame is intended to provide a framework of basic standards for IAIGs and a process for supervisors to cooperate in the supervision of IAIGs. Also in November 2019, the IAIS adopted a risk-based group-wide global insurance capital standard (\u201cICS\u201d) that will apply to IAIGs and ultimately form a part of ComFrame. The ICS commenced a five-year monitoring period in January 2020 which is being used for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges to provide feedback to the IAIS on the ICS\u2019s design and performance, but will not trigger any supervisory action. Following this monitoring period, the ICS is expected to be implemented in 2025 as a group-wide prescribed capital requirement for IAIGs and integrated into the rest of ComFrame. As noted above under \u201cU.S. Regulation,\u201d it is unclear how the development of the ICS will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the United States and the NAIC\u2019s development of the group capital calculation. Our international operations are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in Mexico, Australia and Canada and in certain other countries in Europe, South America, and Southeast Asia. Generally, our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. Key areas where country regulations may differ include: (i) the type of financial reports to be filed; (ii) a requirement to use local intermediaries; (iii) the amount of reinsurance permissible; (iv) the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates; and (v) the type and frequency of regulatory examinations. Competition\u00a0 The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive, with many insurance companies of various sizes, as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions or captive programs, transacting business in the United States and internationally. We compete directly with a large number of these companies. Competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer. Our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our businesses can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions. Our businesses establish their own pricing practices based upon a Company-wide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit.  Competition for insurance business within the United States comes from other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national multi-line companies and reinsurers. Our specialty businesses compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers. Our regional businesses compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers. Additionally, direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional businesses by writing insurance through their salaried employees, generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the Company. We compete internationally with native insurance operations both large and small, which in some cases are related to government entities, as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies. Competition for reinsurance business, which is especially strong, comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers, which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market. These competitors include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Partner Re and others.   In recent years, various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries. Well-capitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries, or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital, provide increasing competition, which may  23 23 23    adversely impact our business and profitability. Further, an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and, as a consequence, those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively.  Human Capital Resources\u00a0  As of January 15, 2023, we employed 8,186 individuals. Of this number, our subsidiaries employed 8,049 individuals and the remaining individuals were employed at the parent company.  We believe that our people are our greatest asset and that our corporate culture is the most important intangible driver of long-term value creation for our Company and the highest priority for pursuing long-term risk-adjusted returns and growth in stockholder value. Human Capital Management: The Company fosters a performance culture. We are focused on creating a respectful, rewarding, diverse, and inclusive work environment that allows our employees to build meaningful and productive careers. The success of these human capital management objectives is essential to our strategy, as it is our people who drive our success. We invest in their growth as individuals and professionals through training and engagement, as well as in their well-being through robust health and wellness programs and a commitment to diversity.  The Company provides developmental opportunities for our employees through formal and informal programs that focus on enabling employees to build skills and thought leadership in specific facets of our business. Our leadership programs cultivate the talent of our high-potential, strong-performing employees as we strive to deepen, enhance and diversify the Company\u2019s leadership team.  We strive to align employee incentives with the risk and performance frameworks of the Company. The Company\u2019s \u201cpay for performance\u201d philosophy connects individual, business and Company results to employee compensation, providing employees with opportunities to share in the Company\u2019s overall growth and success. The Company offers employees a comprehensive benefits package, including health and wellness, financial, educational and life management benefits. In addition, we support employees in making an impact in their local communities and globally through environmental and social efforts that are meaningful to them.  Our Board of Directors engages with our senior leadership team, including our senior vice president - human resources, on a periodic basis across a range of human capital management issues, including succession planning and development, compensation, benefits, talent recruiting and retention, engagement, diversity and inclusion, and employee feedback.  Culture: The Board of Directors has recognized Accountability, People Oriented Strategy, Responsible Financial Practices, Risk-Adjusted Returns and Transparency as the elements of corporate culture necessary for the Company to achieve success. Our culture unifies our employees across our decentralized business model, positions us to serve our diverse clients globally and propels the Company\u2019s continuous evolution. We are committed to fostering a unifying culture and encouraging innovation across our enterprise. Our culture encompasses the beliefs that (i) specialized knowledge and having a customer-centric focus are competitive advantages and (ii) an environment that promotes integrity, embraces the commitment to \u201calways do right,\u201d fosters entrepreneurship and innovation, and values making thoughtful decisions for the long-term benefit of our enterprise. While there is no one \u201cBerkley\u201d way, each of our businesses has its own culture that embodies a shared set of values that define our enterprise. Our structure, with more than 55 distinct businesses, facilitates the prompt identification of and appropriate action with respect to addressing individual business or cultural issues arising within a business, without affecting the larger enterprise. Furthermore, our businesses are overseen by senior corporate business managers and senior corporate functional managers, including actuarial, claims, underwriting, compliance and finance, providing a governance oversight structure that makes it easier to identify such issues. Because our Board of Directors diligently exercises its risk management oversight through, among other activities, regular interactions with employees beyond corporate senior management, our directors have visibility into and receive timely feedback on cultural issues that may affect our business. As significant owners of our Company who are required to hold their shares until separation from service, each of our directors and senior executives have a vested interest in cultivating talent and perpetuating a culture that facilitates the execution of our long-term objectives. Other Information about the Company's Business  We maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis. In addition, our businesses develop new coverages or enter lines of business to meet the needs of insureds.  24 24 24    Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance businesses. Although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms, wildfires, earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance, they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods.\u00a0  We have no customer that accounts for 10\u00a0percent or more of our consolidated revenues.  Compliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
