PPL Electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the PAPUC, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. PPL Electric delivers electricity in its Pennsylvania service area and provides electricity supply to retail customers in that area as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act. PPL Electric was organized in 1920 as Pennsylvania Power & Light Company. \u00a0 LG&E, headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is a wholly owned subsidiary of LKE and a regulated utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&E is subject to regulation as a public utility by the KPSC, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. LG&E was incorporated in 1913.  KU, headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, is a wholly owned subsidiary of LKE and a regulated utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and Virginia. KU is subject to regulation as a public utility by the KPSC and the VSCC, and certain of its transmission and wholesale power activities are subject to the jurisdiction  3 3  3 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. KU serves its Kentucky customers under the KU name and its Virginia customers under the Old Dominion Power name. KU was incorporated in Kentucky in 1912 and in Virginia in 1991. \u00a0 Segment Information \u00a0 (PPL) \u00a0 PPL is organized into three reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: Kentucky Regulated, which primarily represents the results of LG&E and KU, Pennsylvania Regulated, which primarily represents the results of PPL Electric, and Rhode Island Regulated, which primarily represents the results of RIE. \"Corporate and Other\" primarily includes financing and other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, as well as certain non-recoverable costs resulting from commitments made to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island in conjunction with the acquisition of Narragansett Electric.   A comparison of PPL's Regulated segments is shown below.

(b)Represents capitalization for Kentucky Regulated, rate base for Pennsylvania Regulated and Rhode Island Regulated. The amount for Rhode Island Regulated excludes acquisition-related adjustments for non-earning assets.   See Note 2 to the Financial Statements for additional financial information by segment.   Beginning on January 1, 2023, the Kentucky Regulated segment will consist primarily of the regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations conducted by LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. Prior to January 1, 2023, the Kentucky Regulated segment also included the financing activities of LKE. The financing activity of LKE will be presented in Corporate and Other beginning on January 1, 2023. As a result of this change, beginning on January 1, 2023, PPL\u2019s segments will consist of the regulated operations of Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island and will exclude any incremental financing activities of holding companies, which Management believes is a more meaningful presentation as it provides information on the core regulated operations of PPL.  (PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)  PPL Electric has two operating segments, distribution and transmission, which are aggregated into a single reportable segment. LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments.  Kentucky Regulated Segment (PPL)  The Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of the regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations conducted by LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. In addition, the Kentucky Regulated segment includes certain financing and other costs at LKE.  (PPL, LG&E and KU) \u00a0 LG&E and KU are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, also Virginia. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&E provides electric service to approximately 433,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 334,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky. KU provides electric service to approximately 541,000 customers in 77 counties in central,  4 4  4 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  southeastern and western Kentucky and approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. KU also sells wholesale electricity to two municipalities in Kentucky under load following contracts. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information. \u00a0 Franchises and Licenses \u00a0 LG&E and KU provide electricity delivery service, and LG&E provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities.\u00a0 \u00a0 Competition  There are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of LG&E and KU. From time to time, bills are introduced into the Kentucky General Assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky. The nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LG&E and KU, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated.  \u00a0 Alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact LG&E's natural gas revenues. Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity. Therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact LG&E's profitability. Some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems.  Power Supply \u00a0 At December\u00a031, 2022, LG&E owned generating capacity of 2,760 MW and KU owned generating capacity of 4,775 MW. See \"Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment\" for a complete list of generating facilities.  \u00a0 The system capacity of LG&E's and KU's owned generation is based upon several factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances. \u00a0 During 2022, LG&E's and KU's power plants generated the following amounts of electricity: GWhFuel SourceLG&EKUCoal10,488\u00a013,880\u00a0Oil\u2014\u00a06\u00a0Gas1,816\u00a05,039\u00a0Hydro278\u00a061\u00a0Solar8\u00a012\u00a0Total (a)12,590\u00a018,998\u00a0  (a)This generation represents an increase for LG&E of 5% and a decrease for KU of 1% from 2021 output.   The majority of LG&E's and KU's generated electricity was used to supply their retail customer bases. \u00a0 LG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their customers. When LG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa. \u00a0 Due to environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, as of December\u00a031, 2022, LG&E and KU have retired approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generation plants since 2010.  LG&E and KU received approval from the KPSC to develop a 4 MW Solar Share facility to service a Solar Share program. The Solar Share program is a voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the Solar Share facility. Construction  5 5  5 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  commences, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. Construction of five 500-kilowatt phases was completed as of December\u00a031, 2022. LG&E and KU continue to market the program and have started receiving subscriptions for the sixth 500-kilowatt phase.  On January 23, 2020, LG&E and KU applied to the KPSC for approval of arrangements relating to the purchase of 100 MW of solar power in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases.\u00a0Pursuant to the agreements, LG&E and KU would purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed third-party solar generation facility and resell the bulk of the power as renewable energy to two large industrial customers and use the remaining power for other customers.\u00a0The generation facility is currently expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2024. In 2020, the KPSC approved LG&E\u2019s and KU\u2019s applications. PPL, LG&E and KU do not anticipate that these arrangements will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition.   On October 6, 2021, LG&E and KU entered into an agreement to purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed 125 MW third-party solar generation facility in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases. Pursuant to the agreements, LG&E and KU would purchase output of the facility and resell power as renewable energy to certain large customers. The generation facility is currently expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2024. PPL, LG&E and KU do not anticipate that this agreement will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition.   On December 15, 2022, LG&E and KU filed an application with the KPSC for a CPCN for the construction of two 621 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine facilities, one at LG&E's Mill Creek Generating Station in Jefferson County, Kentucky and the other at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station in Mercer County, Kentucky, including on-site natural gas and electric transmission construction associated with those facilities and site compatibility certificates. LG&E and KU also applied for a CPCN to construct a 120 MWac solar photovoltaic electric generating facility in Mercer County, Kentucky, and for a CPCN to acquire a 120 MWac solar facility to be built by a third-party solar developer in Marion County, Kentucky. LG&E and KU further applied for a CPCN to construct a 125 MW, 4-hour battery energy storage system facility at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station and for approval of their proposed 2024-2030 DSM programs. The plan includes adding 14 new, adjusted or expanded energy efficiency programs, which would reduce LG&E's and KU's overall need by approximately 100 MW each. Finally, LG&E and KU requested a declaratory order to confirm that their entry into non-firm energy-only power-purchase agreements for the output of four solar photovoltaic facilities with a combined capacity of 637 MW does not require KPSC approval and that LG&E and KU may recover the costs of the solar PPAs through their fuel adjustment clause mechanisms as previously approved for a prior solar PPA. LG&E and KU plan to accrue AFUDC on the constructed NGCCs, solar facility in Mercer County, Kentucky and the battery energy storage system facility and have requested regulatory asset treatment to recover the financing costs of these projects.   The new NGCC would be jointly owned by LG&E (31%) and KU (69%) and the solar units would be jointly owned by LG&E (37%) and KU (63%), the battery storage unit would be owned by LG&E, and the proposed PPA transactions and DSM programs would be entered into or conducted jointly by LG&E and KU, consistent with LG&E and KU's shared dispatch, cost allocation, tariff or other frameworks.  The filing also notes planned retirement dates for certain existing coal-fired generation units, including Mill Creek 1 (300 MW) in 2024 and E.W. Brown 3 (412 MW) in 2028, and updates and advances the planned retirement dates for Mill Creek 2 (297 MW) to 2027 and Ghent 2 (486 MW) to 2028. LG&E and KU anticipate the recovery of associated retirement costs, including the remaining net book value, for these coal-fired generating units through the RAR or other rate mechanisms.   The KPSC accepted the filing as of January 6, 2023 and has indicated its intention to issue an order on all issues by November 6, 2023. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these matters.  Fuel Supply \u00a0 Coal and natural gas are expected to be the predominant fuels used by LG&E and KU for generation for the foreseeable future. Natural gas used for generation is primarily purchased using contractual arrangements separate from LG&E's natural gas distribution operations. Natural gas and oil are also used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. \u00a0 Fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by several factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues, high or low river level events, lock outages and other supplier or transporter operating or financial difficulties. \u00a0 LG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2027 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. 6 6  6 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  \u00a0 For their existing units, LG&E and KU expect, for the foreseeable future, to purchase most of their coal from western Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, northern West Virginia and western Pennsylvania. LG&E and KU continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Trimble County Unit 2. Coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail. \u00a0 To enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, LG&E and KU have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity services with contracts of various durations through 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving Cane Run Unit 7. This pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the Trimble County site as well as two other simple cycle units at the Paddy's Run site. For the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the E.W. Brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility's connection to two interstate pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability. \u00a0 LG&E and KU have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for Cane Run Unit 7 through October 2024. The bulk of the natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market.   (PPL and LG&E)  Natural Gas Distribution Supply \u00a0 Five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (Bcf), are used to provide natural gas service to LG&E's firm sales customers. Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. Without this storage capacity, LG&E would need to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the cost of natural gas supply and pipeline transportation services are expected to be higher. At December\u00a031, 2022, LG&E had 10 Bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $68 million. LG&E will continue work in 2023 on a multi-year project to retire one of its underground natural gas storage fields with a working natural gas capacity of 4 Bcf, with plans to complete by no later than 2025.   LG&E has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers. \u00a0 LG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. LG&E has a set of contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2025 and 2028. Total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day. LG&E has two additional contracts with this same pipeline. One contract is for pipeline capacity through 2026 for 60,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. The other contract is for pipeline capacity through 2028 for 30,000 MMBtu/day during the winter season. LG&E has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2030. \u00a0 LG&E expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in South Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas. \u00a0 (PPL, LG&E and KU)  Transmission  LG&E and KU contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with TranServ International, Inc. to act as their independent transmission organization. \u00a0 Rates \u00a0 LG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, the FERC and the VSCC. LG&E and KU operate under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff. \u00a0 LG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets in Kentucky. 7 7  7 Table of Contents  Table of Contents   KU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except for regulatory assets and liabilities related to the levelized fuel factor, accumulated deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and AROs related to certain CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets. \u00a0 KU's rates to two municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets.  See \"Financial and Operational Developments\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on current rate proceedings and rate mechanisms.  Pennsylvania Regulated Segment (PPL)  The Pennsylvania Regulated segment consists of PPL Electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity.  (PPL and PPL Electric)  PPL Electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.5 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties within eastern and central Pennsylvania. PPL Electric also provides electricity to retail customers in this territory as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information.  Franchise, Licenses and Other Regulations  PPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies that it has succeeded, and as a result of certification by the PAPUC. PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions. In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.  Competition  Pursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PAPUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in Pennsylvania, and PPL Electric does not own or operate any generation facilities.  The PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM.  Rates and Regulation  Transmission  PPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.  PJM serves as a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. In addition to operating the electricity transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. A primary objective of any RTO is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. Certain types of transmission investments are subject to competitive processes outlined in the PJM tariff. 8 8  8 Table of Contents  Table of Contents   As a transmission owner, PPL Electric's transmission revenues are recovered through PJM and billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in PPL Electric\u2019s annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC\u2019s Uniform System of Accounts. Any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. Any change in the prior year PPL zonal peak load billing factor applied on January 1 of each year will result in an increase or decrease in revenue until the next annual rate update is effective on June 1 of that same year.  As a PLR, PPL Electric also purchases transmission services from PJM. See \"PLR\" below.  See \"Financial and Operational Developments\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and regulatory matters.  Distribution  PPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). All regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base. Therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the PAPUC. Currently, PPL Electric's Smart Meter rider and the DSIC are the only riders authorized to earn a return. Certain operating expenses are also included in PPL Electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes.  Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) requires electric distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania. Under the default service procurement plans approved by the PAPUC, PPL Electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the AEPS.  Act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new PLR generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing AEPS.  Act 11 authorizes the PAPUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. PPL Electric utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in its 2015 base rate proceeding. PPL has had the ability to utilize the DSIC recovery mechanism since July 2013.  See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and legislative and regulatory matters.  PLR   The Customer Choice Act requires electric distribution companies, including PPL Electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the PAPUC, to act as a PLR of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the PLR pursuant to PAPUC regulations. In 2022, the following average percentages of PPL Electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 37% of residential, 76% of small commercial and industrial and 95% of large commercial and industrial customers.   PPL Electric\u2019s electricity generation costs are established based upon the results of a competitive solicitation process. In December 2020, the PAPUC approved PPL Electric\u2019s default service plan for the period June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2025, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. Through December\u00a031, 2022, four auctions of the plan were completed. This plan also includes eight solicitations for alternative energy credits held semiannually in January and July. Through January 2023, four alternative energy credit solicitations have been completed.  9 9  9 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Pursuant to the plans, PPL Electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers who elect to take default service from PPL Electric. These solicitations contain a mix of products including 5-year block energy contracts for residential customers, 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers, and alternative energy credit contracts for residential, commercial and industrial customers. These contracts fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a PLR.  Numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in PPL Electric's service area. As the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for PPL Electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers.  Rhode Island Regulated Segment (PPL)  The Rhode Island Regulated segment consists primarily of the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations and regulated distribution and sale of natural gas conducted by RIE.  RIE is engaged in the regulated transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and regulated distribution and sale of natural gas in Rhode Island. RIE provides electric service to approximately 480,000 customers and natural gas service to approximately 270,000 customers. RIE's service area covers substantially all of Rhode Island. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information.  Franchises and Licenses  RIE provides electricity delivery service and natural gas distribution service in its service territory pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by the Rhode Island state legislature, cities or municipalities or other entities.   Competition   There are currently no other electric or gas public utilities operating within the service area of RIE.   Alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact RIE's natural gas revenues. Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. RIE's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity. Therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact RIE's profitability. Some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass RIE's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems.  Rates and Regulation  In general, RIE operates subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, the RIPUC and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers.   Distribution  RIE owns and maintains electric and natural gas distribution networks in Rhode Island. Distribution revenues are primarily from the sale of electricity, natural gas, and related services to retail customers. Distribution sales are regulated by the RIPUC, which is responsible for approving the rates and other terms of services as part of the rate making process. Natural gas and electric distribution revenues are derived from the regulated sale and distribution of electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers within RIE\u2019s service territory under the tariff rates. The tariff rates approved by the RIPUC are designed to recover the costs incurred by RIE for products and services provided, along with a return on investment.  Transmission  RIE owns an electric transmission system in Rhode Island. RIE\u2019s transmission services are regulated by the FERC and coordinated with ISO \u2013 New England. Additionally, RIE makes available its transmission facilities to NEP, for operation and  10 10  10 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  control pursuant to an integrated facilities agreement, Service Agreement No. 23 (Integrated Facilities Agreement or IFA). These revenues arise under tariff/rate agreements.  Deferral Mechanisms  RIE records revenues in accordance with accounting principles for rate-regulated operations for arrangements between RIE and the applicable regulator. These include various deferral mechanisms such as capital trackers, energy efficiency programs, and other programs that qualify as Alternative Revenue Programs (ARPs). ARPs enable RIE to adjust rates in the future, in response to past activities or completed events. RIE\u2019s electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to the RIE\u2019s delivery rates, as a result of the reconciliation between allowed revenue and billed revenue. RIE also has other ARPs related to the achievement of certain objectives, demand side management initiatives, and certain other rate making mechanisms. RIE recognizes ARPs with a corresponding offset to a regulatory asset or liability account when the regulatory specified events or conditions have been met, when the amounts are determinable, and are probable of recovery (or payment) through future rate adjustments.  At December\u00a031, 2022, all of RIE\u2019s regulatory assets are authorized to earn a rate of return except $98 million of environmental response costs, $77 million of postretirement benefits and $61 million of net metering deferral costs.  Last Resort Service  RIE is required by the RIPUC and by statute to provide Last Resort Service. Last Resort Service is available to all customers who have not elected to receive their electric supply from a non-regulated power producer or any customer who, for any reason, has stopped receiving generation service from a non-regulated power producer.  The charge for Last Resort Service is the sum of the applicable Last Resort Service charges in addition to all appropriate Retail Delivery charges as stated in the applicable tariff. The monthly charge for Last Resort Service also includes the costs incurred by RIE to comply with the Renewable Energy Standard, established in Rhode Island General Laws Section 39-26-1 and the costs to comply with the RIPUC\u2019s Rules Governing Energy Source Disclosure. The charge for Last Resort Service includes the administrative costs associated with the procurement of Last Resort Service, including an adjustment for uncollectible accounts as approved by the RIPUC.  Numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in RIE's service area. As the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for RIE, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers.  See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and regulatory matters.  Natural Gas Distribution Supply  To meet the projected annual gas supply requirements of approximately 37 Bcf, RIE has a portfolio of gas supply arrangements of varying contractual terms and durations to provide service to its customers. These natural gas supply arrangements include contracts with natural gas producers and marketers that reflect market price signals. RIE also has firm pipeline and underground storage capacity contracts to support the delivery of natural gas supplies to its customers. To manage the winter peak requirements for RIE customers, RIE contracts for liquified natural gas (LNG) service and owns and operates certain LNG storage facilities.  The RIE gas supply portfolio includes contracts for firm transportation service with eleven interstate pipeline companies and natural gas storage operators. These contracts have various termination dates with certain contracts being subject to evergreen renewal provisions providing RIE with flexibility in managing its upstream resource portfolio.   RIE has purchased and expects to continue to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions accessed by its pipeline capacity portfolio in South Texas, East Texas, and Louisiana, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas. RIE expects to purchase certain natural gas supplies that originate in Canada and from regional LNG import terminals.  11 11  11 Table of Contents  Table of Contents   Corporate and Other (PPL)  PPL Services provides PPL subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. The costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees or a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs.  PPL Capital Funding provides financing for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries. PPL's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that enables PPL to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of PPL's rated companies. As a result, PPL utilizes PPL Capital Funding as a source of capital in financings, in addition to continued direct financing by certain operating subsidiaries.  Unlike those of PPL Services, PPL Capital Funding's costs are not generally charged to PPL subsidiaries. Costs are charged directly to PPL. However, PPL Capital Funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisition of LKE and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the Kentucky Regulated Segment. Prior to 2021, the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other PPL Capital Funding securities, were assigned to the relevant segments for purposes of PPL management's assessment of segment performance. Beginning in 2021, corporate level financing costs are no longer allocated to the reportable segments.   ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  (All Registrants)  The Registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters, and may be subject to different and more stringent such laws and regulations enacted in the future. The EPA and other federal agencies with jurisdiction over environmental matters have issued numerous environmental regulations relating to air, water and waste that directly affect the electric power industry. Due to these environmental issues, it may be necessary for the Registrants to modify or cease certain operations or operation of certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts. In addition, legal challenges to environmental permits or rules add uncertainty to estimating future costs of complying with such permits and rules. The Biden administration is currently undertaking changes in a wide range of environmental programs.  See \u201cLegal Matters\u201d in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental commitments and contingencies. See \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2023 through 2025. See Note 20 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs.  LG&E and KU are entitled to recover, through the ECR mechanism, certain costs of complying with the Clean Air Act, as amended, and other federal, state and local environmental requirements applicable to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired generating facilities upon KPSC review. Costs not covered by the ECR mechanism for LG&E and KU and all such costs for PPL Electric are subject to rate recovery at the discretion of the companies' respective state regulatory authorities, or the FERC, if applicable. Because PPL Electric and RIE do not own any generating plants, they have less exposure to related environmental compliance costs. The Registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future proceedings before regulatory authorities.  Air  NAAQS (PPL, LG&E and KU)  Applicable regulations require each state to identify areas within its boundaries that fail to meet the NAAQS, (known as nonattainment areas), and develop a state implementation plan to achieve and maintain compliance. States that are found to contribute significantly to another state's nonattainment with ozone standards are required to establish \"good neighbor\" state implementation plans. In addition, for attainment of ozone and fine particulates standards, certain states, including Kentucky, are subject to a regional EPA program known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR).    12 12  12 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  The Clean Air Act has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel generation plants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA periodically to establish and review NAAQS for six pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (contributed to by nitrogen oxide emissions), particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. In December 2020, the EPA released final actions keeping the existing NAAQS standard for particulate matter and ozone without change, but the EPA subsequently announced reconsideration of those decisions in June 2021. On January 6, 2023, the EPA released a pre-publication proposed revision to the particulate matter standard that would lower the primary standard for fine particulates to a level to be determined after review of additional public comments. Depending on the final standard adopted by the EPA, the EPA could potentially designate Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville) as being in nonattainment with the new particulate matter standard and require additional particulate matter reductions from sources including LG&E\u2019s Mill Creek Station. PPL, LG&E, and KU are unable to predict the outcome of future evaluations by the EPA and the states with respect to the NAAQS standards.  In January 2018, the EPA designated Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville) as being in nonattainment with the existing 2015 ozone standard. In 2020 and 2021, LG&E entered into agreements with the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District for temporary nitrogen oxide emission limits at LG&E's Mill Creek Station during those years to facilitate compliance with the ozone standard. In October 2022, Jefferson County was \u201cbumped up\u201d to the moderate nonattainment classification, but the Louisville Air Pollution Control District has applied to the EPA for Jefferson County to be redesignated as in attainment. Although PPL and LG&E expect Jefferson County to be redesignated as in attainment, if the EPA declines to issue such a redesignation, Jefferson County could be subject to additional requirements including requirements for installation of reasonably available control technology on coal-fired generating units. Compliance with such requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions. PPL and LG&E are unable to determine the impact on operations until certain compliance determinations are made by the EPA and Kentucky.  In March 2021, the EPA released final revisions to the CSAPR, aimed at ensuring compliance with the 2008 ozone NAAQS and providing for reductions in ozone season nitrogen oxide emissions for 2021 and subsequent years from sources in 12 states, including Kentucky. Additionally, the EPA reversed its previous approval of the Kentucky State Implementation Plan with respect to these requirements. In February 2022, the EPA Administrator released a proposed Federal Implementation Plan under the Good Neighbor provisions of the Clean Air Act providing for significant additional nitrogen oxide emission reductions for compliance with the revised 2015 ozone NAAQS. The proposed reductions in Kentucky state-wide nitrogen oxide budgets are scheduled to commence in 2023, with the largest reductions planned for 2026, based on the installation time frame for certain selective catalytic reduction controls, subject to future specific allowance calculations. PPL, LG&E and KU are currently assessing the potential impact of the proposed Good Neighbor Plan revisions on operations. The current and proposed rules provide for reduced availability of nitrogen oxide allowances that have historically permitted operational flexibility for fossil units and could potentially result in constraints that may require implementation of additional emission controls or accelerate implementation of lower emission generation technologies. Pursuant to the President\u2019s executive order, the EPA is currently reviewing its previous determinations made in December 2020 to retain the existing NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter without change, including a pre-publication proposed revision that was released by the EPA on January 6, 2023.  PPL, LG&E, and KU are unable to predict future emission reductions that may be required by future federal rules or state implementation actions. Compliance with the NAAQS, CSAPR and related requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions, inclusive of retirements, the costs of which PPL, LG&E and KU believe would be subject to rate recovery.  Climate Change (All Registrants)  The Biden administration is undertaking wide-ranging efforts to address climate change. Recent government actions and policy developments, including the President\u2019s announced goal of a carbon free electricity sector by 2035, could have far-reaching impacts on PPL\u2019s business operations, products, and services. On June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that provisions of the EPA's Clean Power Plan, premised on generation shifting from coal-fired plants to lower emitting natural gas-fired plants and renewables, exceeded the authority granted to the EPA under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has announced that it plans on issuing new greenhouse gas rules in the future. It is uncertain how the Supreme Court ruling may impact future EPA rulemaking. All of these developments are preliminary or ongoing in nature and the Registrants cannot predict the final outcome or ultimate impact on operations.  PPL has adopted a goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which PPL expects will include continuing to retire coal-fired generation and investing in research and innovation that will help to achieve this goal, while maintaining reliable and affordable energy in our service territories. The net-zero goal relates to direct and indirect carbon emissions consistent with Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance and referenced by the EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership. Through 2021, PPL reduced carbon emissions nearly 60% from 2010 levels and is targeting a 70% reduction from 2010 levels by 2035 and an 80% reduction by 2040.   13 13  13 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  PPL is also aware of the various risks associated with climate change, including increased frequency and severity of severe weather. To address these risks, PPL continues to work to advance grid modernization and improve the Company's equipment to help mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events and improve reliability.  Water/Waste  (PPL, LG&E and KU)  Clean Water Act  Regulations under the federal Clean Water Act dictate permitting and mitigation requirements for facilities and construction projects that impact \"Waters of the United States\". Many other requirements relate to power plant operations, including the treatment of pollutants in effluents prior to discharge, the temperature of effluent discharges and the location, design and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities, and standards intended to protect aquatic organisms that become trapped at or pulled through cooling water intake structures at generating facilities. These requirements could impose significant costs for LG&E and KU, which are expected to be subject to rate recovery.  Clean Water Act Jurisdiction  Environmental groups and others have claimed that discharges to groundwater from leaking CCR impoundments at power plants are subject to Clean Water Act permitting. On April 12, 2019, the EPA released regulatory clarification finding that Clean Water Act jurisdiction does not cover such discharges to groundwater. On January 23, 2020, the EPA announced a final rule modifying the jurisdictional scope of the Clean Water Act. The announced rule revises the definition of the \"Waters of the United States,\" including a revision to exclude groundwater from the definition. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that Clean Water Act jurisdiction may apply to certain discharges to groundwater that result in the functional equivalent of a direct discharge to navigable waters. PPL, LG&E, and KU are unaware of any unpermitted releases from their facilities that are subject to Clean Water Act jurisdiction, but future regulatory developments and judicial rulings could potentially subject certain releases from CCR impoundments and landfills to additional permitting and remediation requirements, which could impose substantial costs. Any associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome or financial impact of future regulatory proceedings and litigation.  Waters of the United States  PPL, LG&E, and KU are subject to permitting and mitigation requirements for certain construction activities that impact \"Waters of the United States.\" On April 21, 2020, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule revising the definition of \"Waters of the United States\" to exclude jurisdiction over certain surface waters. On August 30, 2021, a U.S. District Court in Arizona vacated and remanded the rule. On December 7, 2021, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed to repeal the rule and restore the definition of \"Waters of the United States\" that was in place prior to 2015. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of a case raising the issue of the appropriate scope of the definition of \"Waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act. On January 18, 2023, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final revision to the rule broadening the definition of Waters of the United States and reverting to the pre-2015 regulatory framework. Although the broader definition incorporates additional water bodies, any resulting permitting, construction, and operational expenses are expected to be immaterial and subject to rate recovery. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of current or future litigation or regulatory proceedings, but do not expect a material impact on operations.  Superfund and Other Remediation  (All Registrants)  From time to time, PPL's subsidiaries undertake testing, monitoring or remedial action in response to spills or other releases at various on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the EPA and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary to comply with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners and other third parties alleging impacts from PPL's operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental matters that arise in the course of normal operations. Based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operations of PPL, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU.  Future cleanup or remediation work at sites not yet identified may result in significant additional costs for the Registrants. Insurance policies maintained by LG&E and KU may be available to cover certain of the costs or other obligations related to these matters, but the amount of insurance coverage or reimbursement cannot be estimated or assured.  14 14  14 Table of Contents  Table of Contents   See \u201cLegal Matters\u201d in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information.  (All Registrants)  SEASONALITY  The demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. As a result, the Registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when unpredictable weather conditions make such fluctuations more pronounced. The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned.   FINANCIAL CONDITION  See \"Financial Condition\" in \"Item 7.

Among the items discussed are  15 15  15 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  statistics regarding Ethics Helpline reports and employee concerns. This information is also reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board quarterly.   PPL will continue to engage with employees and to assess these priorities as we work to best position individuals and the company for future success. PPL had a turnover rate of 10.7% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022. Looking forward, we will maintain our strong focus on workforce planning to address future talent needs.  At December\u00a031, 2022, PPL and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees and employees represented by labor unions: Total Full-TimeEmployeesNumber of\u00a0UnionEmployeesPercentage of TotalWorkforcePPL6,527\u00a02,411\u00a037\u00a0%PPL Electric1,382\u00a0913\u00a066\u00a0%LG&E964\u00a0618\u00a064\u00a0%KU807\u00a0109\u00a014\u00a0%  (PPL and PPL Electric)   In March 2022, members of the IBEW Local 1600 ratified a new five-year labor agreement with PPL and PPL Electric. The contract covers over 900 employees and was effective May 16, 2022. The current five-year agreement expires in May 2027. The terms of the new labor agreement are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial results of PPL or PPL Electric.  (PPL and KU)   Labor agreement negotiations with the KU USW are expected to commence in July 2023. The current contract covers over 40 employees and is scheduled to expire in August 2023.  (PPL and LG&E)   Labor agreement negotiations with the LG&E IBEW are expected to commence in October 2023. The current contract covers over 600 employees and is scheduled to expire in November 2023.   CYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT  The Registrants and their subsidiaries are subject to risks from cyber-attacks that have the potential to cause significant interruptions to the operation of their businesses. The frequency of these attempted intrusions has increased in recent years and the sources, motivations and techniques of attack continue to evolve and change rapidly. PPL has adopted a variety of measures to monitor and address cyber-related risks and continues to implement and explore additional cybersecurity measures. Cybersecurity and the effectiveness of PPL's cybersecurity strategy are regular topics of discussion at Board of Directors meetings. PPL's strategy for managing cyber-related risks is risk-based and, where appropriate, integrated within PPL's enterprise risk management processes. PPL's Vice President and Chief Security Officer (CSO), who reports directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), leads a dedicated cybersecurity team and is responsible for the design, implementation, and execution of cyber-risk management strategy. In addition, among other things, the CSO and the cybersecurity team actively monitor the Registrants' systems, regularly review policies, compliance, regulations and best practices, perform penetration testing, conduct incident response exercises and internal ethical phishing campaigns, and provide training and communication across the organization to strengthen secure behavior and foster a culture of security. The cybersecurity team also routinely participates in industry-wide programs to further information sharing, intelligence gathering, and unity of effort in responding to potential or actual attacks. In addition, PPL has a formal internal policy and procedures for communicating cybersecurity incidents on an enterprise-wide basis.   In addition to these enterprise-wide initiatives, PPL's Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island operations are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cybersecurity requirements that are developed and enforced by NERC and approved by the FERC to protect grid security and reliability. LG&E is also subject to certain security directives related to cybersecurity issued by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Transportation Security Administration in 2021. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information on these directives. Finally, PPL purchases insurance to protect against a wide range of costs that could be incurred in connection with cyber-related incidents. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be effective to prevent interruption of services or other damage to the Registrants' businesses or operations or that PPL's insurance coverage will cover all costs incurred in connection with any cyber-related incident.  16 16  16 Table of Contents  Table of Contents   AVAILABLE INFORMATION  PPL's Internet website is www.pplweb.com.
