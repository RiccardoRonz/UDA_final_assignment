In addition, revenue is generated from music distribution, stage plays and post-production services through Industrial Light & Magic and Skywalker Sound. The Company also publishes National Geographic magazine, which is reported with Content Sales/Licensing. TV/VOD Distribution We license our content to third-party television networks, television stations and other video service providers for distribution to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices, including through other DTC services. Theatrical Distribution The Company licenses full-length live-action and animated films to theaters globally. Cumulatively through September\u00a030, 2023, the Company has released approximately 1,100 full-length live-action films and 100 full-length animated films. In the domestic and most major international markets, we generally distribute and market our films directly. In certain international markets our films are distributed by independent companies. In some territories, certain films may be exclusively distributed on our DTC streaming services. During fiscal 2024, we expect to release approximately 15 films, although the ultimate number of releases will depend on when productions resume following the writers/actors\u2019 work stoppages.  The Company incurs significant marketing and advertising costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film in an effort to generate public awareness of the film, to increase the public\u2019s intent to view the film and to help generate consumer interest in the subsequent home entertainment and other ancillary markets. These costs are expensed as incurred, which may result in a loss on a film in the theatrical markets, including in periods prior to the theatrical release of the film. Home Entertainment Distribution We distribute the Company\u2019s film and episodic content in home entertainment markets on DVD and Blu-ray disc, through electronic home video licenses and VOD rentals globally.  Domestically and internationally, we distribute directly to retailers and through independent distribution companies.

The Company also operates Disney Movie Club, which sells DVD/Blu-ray discs directly to consumers in the U.S. and Canada. Distribution of film content in the home entertainment window generally starts within three months after the theatrical release. Electronic formats are typically available approximately four to eight weeks ahead of the physical release. We also license titles to VOD e-tailers concurrent with physical home entertainment distribution. Distribution of episodic content in the home entertainment window includes electronic sales of season passes that can be purchased prior to, during and after the broadcast season with individual episodes typically available to season pass customers shortly after the initial airing of the show in each territory. Access to individual episodes is also available for electronic purchase shortly after the initial airing in each territory. Disney Theatrical Group Disney Theatrical Group develops, produces and licenses live entertainment events on Broadway and around the world.

Original content is also commissioned and produced by various third-party studios. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.  Costs to produce content are generally capitalized and allocated across Entertainment\u2019s businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.  Generally, the Company has full production and distribution rights to its IP. However, prior to the Company\u2019s acquisition of Marvel, Sony Pictures Entertainment licensed from Marvel the rights to produce and distribute Spider-Man films in all windows except for the merchandise rights, which the Company retains. The Company has a significant library of content spanning approximately 100 years of production history as well as acquired libraries. The library of content includes approximately 5,100 live-action film titles and 400 animated film titles, as well as episodic series with four or more seasons (approximately 75 dramas, 55 comedies, 35 non-scripted series, 15 animated series and 10 live-action series). In addition, the library includes approximately 100 series and 65 films that were produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.  In fiscal 2024, the Company plans to produce or commission approximately 225 episodic and film titles, although the ultimate number will depend on when productions resume following the writers/actors\u2019 work stoppages. The vast majority of our productions will be distributed on our Linear Networks and/or DTC platforms or theatrically. Programming is also produced for third parties, which typically have domestic linear distribution rights while the Company retains domestic VOD and international distribution rights. We also license, acquire or produce local content for use in various countries/territories.  Competition and Seasonality Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer compete for viewers\u2019 attention and audience share primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services, social media and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs, other DTC streaming services and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas. Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company\u2019s contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry, including subscriber trends, and other factors may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place. Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment and a significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and episodic content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay TV/VOD services, and produce music and live theater.  The operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. We also compete with other media and entertainment companies, independent production companies and VOD services for creative and performing talent, story properties, show concepts, scripted and other programming, advertiser support, production facilities and exhibition outlets that are essential to the success of our Entertainment businesses. Advertising revenues at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, domestic advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues vary with the subscriber trends of MVPDs.

Competition and Seasonality The Company\u2019s theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise. All of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. In addition, theme park and resort revenues may be higher during significant celebrations such as theme park or character anniversaries and lower in the periods following such celebrations. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company\u2019s first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION The Company\u2019s businesses throughout the world are affected by its ability to exploit and protect against infringement of its IP, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets.

Risks related to the protection and exploitation of IP rights and information concerning the expiration of certain of our copyrights are set forth in Item\u00a01A \u2013 Risk Factors.  FEDERAL REGULATION \u2014 ENTERTAINMENT AND SPORTS Television broadcasting is subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under federal laws and regulations, including the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. FCC regulations that affect linear channels include the following: \u2022Licensing of television stations. Each of the television stations we own must be licensed by the FCC. These licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years, and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations. We (and the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture) must also obtain FCC approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station. The FCC may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances and may delay renewals while permitting a licensee to continue operating. Although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past or have been permitted to continue operations when renewal is delayed, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future. \u2022Station ownership limits. The FCC imposes limitations on the number of television stations and radio stations an entity can own in a specific market, on the combined number of television and radio stations an entity can own in a single market and on the aggregate percentage of the national audience that can be reached by television stations. Currently: \u25e6FCC regulations may restrict our ability to own more than one television station in a market, depending on the size and nature of the market. We do not own more than one television station in any market. \u25e6Federal statutes permit our television stations in the aggregate to reach a maximum of 39% of the national audience. Pursuant to the most recent decision by the FCC as to how to calculate compliance with this limit, our eight stations reach approximately 20% of the national audience. \u2022Dual networks. FCC rules currently prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks \u2014 ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC \u2014 from being under common ownership or control. 16 16 16 TABLE OF CONTENTS TABLE OF CONTENTS \u2022Regulation of programming. The FCC regulates broadcast programming by, among other things, banning \u201cindecent\u201d programming, regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during children\u2019s programming. Penalties for broadcasting indecent programming can be over $400,000 per indecent utterance or image per station. Federal legislation and FCC rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, broadcast stations are generally required to provide an average of three hours per week of programming that has as a \u201csignificant purpose\u201d meeting the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance. \u2022Cable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations. With respect to MVPDs operating within a television station\u2019s Designated Market Area, FCC rules require that every three years each television station elect either \u201cmust carry\u201d status, pursuant to which MVPDs generally must carry a local television station in the station\u2019s market, or \u201cretransmission consent\u201d status, pursuant to which the MVPDs must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal. The ABC owned television stations have historically elected retransmission consent. \u2022Cable and satellite carriage of programming. The Communications Act and FCC rules regulate some aspects of negotiations between programmers and distributors regarding the carriage of networks by cable and satellite distribution companies, and some cable and satellite distribution companies have sought regulation of additional aspects of the carriage of programming on their systems. New legislation, court action or regulation in this area could have an impact on the Company\u2019s operations. The foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, other legislation and specific FCC rules and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, other legislation, FCC rules and public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of the FCC\u2019s regulatory authority. FCC laws and regulations are subject to change, and the Company generally cannot predict whether new legislation, court action or regulations, or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations, would have an adverse impact on our operations.
