{"cik": 100885, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business \u00a0 GENERAL \u00a0 Union Pacific Railroad Company is the principal operating company of Union Pacific Corporation. One of America's most recognized companies, Union Pacific Railroad Company connects 23 states in the western two-thirds of the country by rail, providing a critical link in the global supply chain. The Railroad\u2019s diversified business mix includes Bulk, Industrial, and Premium. Union Pacific serves many of the fastest-growing U.S. population centers, operates from all major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to Eastern gateways, connects with Canada's rail systems, and is the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. Union Pacific provides value to its roughly 10,000 customers by delivering products in a safe, reliable, fuel-efficient, and environmentally responsible manner. \u00a0 Union Pacific Corporation was incorporated in Utah in 1969 and maintains its principal executive offices at 1400 Douglas Street, Omaha, NE 68179. The telephone number at that address is (402) 544-5000. The common stock of Union Pacific Corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol \u201cUNP\u201d. \u00a0 For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to \"Union Pacific\", \u201cUPC\u201d, \u201cCorporation\u201d, \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, and \u201cour\u201d shall mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which we separately refer to as \u201cUPRR\u201d or the \u201cRailroad\u201d. \u00a0 STRATEGY \u00a0 The Company\u2019s growth strategy focuses on growing customer value through innovative supply chain solutions and aspiring to Serve, Grow, Win \u2013 Together. \u00a0 Serve:\u00a0 Driving operational excellence to create a safer, more reliable, and efficient service product.\u00a0Precision scheduled railroading (PSR) is the foundation for delivering customer-centered operational excellence by: \u00a0 1. 2. 3. 4. \u00a0 We aim to move cars faster and\u00a0reduce\u00a0the number of times each car is touched, resulting in terminal consolidation opportunities, improved asset utilization, and fewer car classifications, which in turn leads to products getting to the market quicker and more reliably.\u00a0The result is a better customer experience, which enables us to grow our market share. \u00a0 Grow:\u00a0 By harnessing the potential of the best rail franchise in the industry, we expect to generate growth in three ways \u2013 increasing profitable carloads that fit our network and transportation plan,\u00a0providing more products and services to create value for our customers,\u00a0and increasing the geographic reach of our franchise through innovative supply chain solutions. \u00a0 Win:\u00a0 Driving strong financial performance resulting in significant shareholder returns.\u00a0Execution of our plans to both serve and grow, leads to higher revenues with improved margins and greater cash generation, creating\u00a0long term enterprise value. \u00a0 Together:\u00a0 Engaging our four stakeholder groups \u2013 Communities, Customers, Employees, and Shareholders.\u00a0Our comprehensive approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance\u00a0issues, \u201cBuilding a Sustainable Future 2030,\u201d\u00a0is designed to address the evolving interests of our stakeholders and is built on five areas of concentration \u2013 Building Responsible Foundations, Investing in our Workforce, Driving Sustainable Solutions, Championing Environmental Stewardship, and Strengthening our Communities.\u00a0 \u00a0 We believe that operational excellence and an engaged workforce with deep market knowledge and strong customer relationships supports best-in-class safety, a customer experience that drives growth, and shareholder returns.\u00a0 \u00a0 As we work to transform our railroad into the safest, most reliable, and most efficient in North America, our values continue guiding us.\u00a0Our passion for performance will help us win; our high ethical standards will lead us to win in a way that supports all of our stakeholders; and our teamwork will make sure we win together. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       6\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       6\n     \n\n \n\n       6\n     \n \n       6\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 OPERATIONS \u00a0 The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although we provide revenues by commodity group, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. Additional information regarding our business and operations, including revenues, financial information and data, and other information regarding environmental matters, is presented in Risk Factors, Item 1A; Legal Proceedings, Item 3; Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7; and the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 (which include information regarding revenues, statements of income, and total assets).\u00a0 \u00a0 Operations\u00a0\u2013\u00a0UPRR is a Class I railroad operating in the U.S. We have 32,534\u00a0route miles, connecting Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and Eastern U.S. gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican gateways. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers to move freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic moves through Gulf Coast, Pacific Coast, and East Coast\u00a0ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders. In 2022, we generated freight revenues totaling $23.2\u00a0billion\u00a0from the following three commodity groups: 2022\u00a0Freight Revenues \n\n\n \n \u00a0 Bulk \u2013 The Company's Bulk shipments consist of grain and grain products, fertilizer, food and refrigerated, and coal and renewables. In 2022, this group generated 33% of our freight revenues. We access most major grain markets, connecting the Midwest and Western U.S. producing areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast ports\u00a0as well as Mexico. We also serve significant domestic markets, including grain processors, animal feeders, and ethanol producers in the Midwest and West. Fertilizer movements originate in the Gulf Coast region, Midwest, Western U.S., and Canada (through interline access) for delivery to major agricultural users in those areas as well as abroad. The Railroad\u2019s network supports the transportation of coal shipments to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the U.S. Through interchange gateways and ports, UPRR\u2019s reach extends to Eastern U.S. utilities as well as to Mexico and other international destinations. Coal traffic originating in the Powder River Basin (PRB) area of Wyoming is the largest portion of the Railroad\u2019s coal business. Renewable shipments for customers committed to sustainability consist primarily of biomass exports and wind turbine components. \u00a0 Industrial \u2013 Our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout North America. The Industrial group consists of several categories, including construction, industrial chemicals, plastics, forest products, specialized products (primarily waste, salt, and roofing), metals and ores, petroleum, liquid petroleum gases (LPG), soda ash, and sand. Transportation of these products accounted for 35% of our freight revenues in 2022. Commercial, residential, and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel, aggregates, cement, and wood products. Industrial and light manufacturing plants receive steel, nonferrous materials, minerals, and other raw materials. \u00a0 The industrial chemicals market consists of a vast number of chemical compounds that support the manufacturing of more complex chemicals. Plastics shipments support automotive, housing, and the durable and disposable consumer goods markets. Forest product shipments include lumber and paper commodities. Lumber shipments originate primarily in the Pacific Northwest or Western Canada and move throughout the U.S. for use in new home construction and repairs and remodeling. Paper shipments primarily support packaging needs. Oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel, finished pipe, stone, and drilling fluid commodities. The Company\u2019s petroleum and LPG shipments are primarily impacted by refinery utilization rates, regional crude pricing differentials, pipeline capacity, and the use of asphalt for road programs. Soda ash originates in southwestern Wyoming and California, destined for chemical and glass producing markets in North America and abroad. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       7\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       7\n     \n\n \n\n       7\n     \n \n       7\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Premium \u2013 In 2022, Premium shipments generated 32% of Union Pacific\u2019s total freight revenues. Premium includes finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers, both domestic and international. International business consists of import and export traffic moving in 20 or 40-foot shipping containers, that mainly pass through West Coast ports, destined for one of the Company's many inland intermodal terminals. Domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within North America for intermodal marketing companies (primarily shipper agents and logistics companies) as well as truckload carriers. \u00a0 We are the largest automotive carrier west of the Mississippi River and operate or access 39\u00a0vehicle distribution centers. The Railroad\u2019s extensive franchise accesses six\u00a0vehicle assembly plants and connects to West Coast ports, all six major Mexico gateways, and the Port of Houston to accommodate both import and export shipments. In addition to transporting finished vehicles, the Company\u00a0provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. \u00a0 Seasonality \u2013 Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity (such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons) and the demand cycle for the commodity (such as intermodal traffic that generally peaks during the third quarter to meet back-to-school and holiday-related demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter). The peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably each year depending upon various factors, including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies;\u00a0consumer demand;\u00a0the strength of harvests, which can be adversely affected by severe weather; market prices for agricultural products; and supply chain disruptions. \u00a0 Proud & Engaged Workforce\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Our employees are central to\u00a0our Serve, Grow, Win \u2013 Together strategy, and Investing in our Workforce is one of the five areas of\u00a0concentration in\u00a0our \"Building a Sustainable Future 2030\" strategy. \u00a0 Our People: Our award-winning, multigenerational workforce includes talented people from all walks of life, in many stages of life. Made up of management and craft professionals, we are focused on attracting, retaining, and developing talent across our entire system. \u00a0 As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 33,179\u00a0employees.\u00a0Our workforce includes five generations from Traditionalists (born before 1946) to Generation Z (born after 1998).\u00a0The average age is 46.5 with average tenure\u00a0of 15.8 years. \u00a0 Union Pacific works with 13 major rail unions, representing approximately 83% of our workforce.\u00a0Most craft professionals and more than 45 railroads participate in negotiations on a national multi-employer basis. The National Carriers Conference Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference, consisting of the top labor officers in most Class I railroads, is the bargaining committee for the industry. Railroads are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA), a federal statute enacted in 1926 to bring the railroads and unions to agreement without disruptions to rail transportation. The RLA includes numerous safeguards to help overcome bargaining stalemates. \u00a0 The recent round of labor negotiations related to years 2020-2024 concluded in December 2022.\u00a0See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Other Matters \u2013 Labor Agreements, Item 7, of this report for information about the conclusion of the 2020-2024 negotiations. The next round of negotiations begins on January 1, 2025, related to years 2025-2029.\u00a0 \u00a0 Our Culture:\u00a0We incorporate our commitment to safety, high ethical standards, passion for performance, and teamwork into our day-to-day operations as we service our customers.\u00a0 \u00a0 Safety is central to everything we do at Union Pacific.\u00a0Together, we are committed to cultivating a safety-focused culture, so our employees return home safely every day. To achieve this, our employees identify risks, initiate action to mitigate those risks, and have the courage to care to keep each other safe. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       8\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       8\n     \n\n \n\n       8\n     \n \n       8\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Our success is measured by our personal injury rate (the number of reportable injuries for every 200,000 employee-hours worked), and our derailment incident rate (the number of reportable derailment incidents per million train miles). Reportable personal injuries are defined as on duty incidents or occupational illnesses that result in employees\u00a0losing\u00a0time away from work, modifying or restricting their normal duties, or receiving\u00a0any medical treatment above and beyond first aid. Reportable derailment incidents are defined as any occurrence where a\u00a0wheel of a locomotive or rail car falls off the track that causes damage to track, equipment, or structures\u00a0above the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) reporting threshold, regardless of ownership ($11,300 for 2022\u00a0and $11,500 for 2023). The personal injuries and derailment incidents that meet reportable criteria are reported to\u00a0the FRA. \u00a0 Our 2022 personal injury rate of 0.80\u00a0improved 18%\u00a0while our derailment incident rate of\u00a02.88\u00a0increased 8%\u00a0versus 2021. (See further discussion in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7, of this report.) \u00a0 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion:\u00a0Union Pacific\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion is based on our desire to create an environment where people can be their best, personally and professionally. From an employee\u2019s perspective, a diverse culture increases engagement, improves morale, and supports safety. From a business perspective, diversity improves the Company\u2019s decision-making, problem-solving, and strategic thinking, which translates into a competitive advantage with bottom-line results. \u00a0 Union Pacific\u2019s commitment,\u00a0today and for the future, is to further improve and strengthen performance through an inclusive workforce that reflects the diverse markets and communities we serve, where everyone is treated fairly, and differences are valued. To that end, Union Pacific established\u00a0a goal to reach 40% people of color and double our female representation to 11% in our workforce\u00a0by 2030. As of December 31, 2022, workforce representation of people of color and females was approximately 32.8% and 5.5%, respectively. \u00a0 The Employee Journey:\u00a0From recruitment to retirement and milestones in between, we are relentlessly focused on supporting and engaging employees throughout their Union Pacific journey. We view it as imperative to invest in our employees with meaningful benefit offerings, developmental experiences, and career opportunities. \u00a0 The process begins with recruitment, where we strive to attract the most talented and diverse employees to join our team.\u00a0Then, we focus on training and development, which includes programs designed to recognize potential and to help our employees grow into new roles so that we can retain our workforce over time. \u00a0 Providing competitive compensation and meaningful benefits is key to attracting and retaining talented employees. Union Pacific is committed to continuously reviewing its compensation programs and comprehensive benefits programs to promote programs that are fair and competitive. Both are key to enhancing the value of working for Union Pacific and demonstrating the Company\u2019s commitment to the health and wealth of employees during their career. Benefits vary based on the applicable collective bargaining agreement or an employee\u2019s management status. The final stage of the employee journey is a fulfilling retirement, which is enabled during their UP career through our compensation and benefit programs, particularly contributions to 401(k) plans\u00a0and the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). \u00a0 Our Board of Directors evaluates our non-union compensation plans and reviews recommendations from the Compensation and Benefits Committee, while collective bargaining agreements govern compensation for our union employees. The median annual compensation for all employees employed as of December 31, 2022, was $86,778\u00a0(excluding the CEO). \u00a0 Talent is critical \u2013 our ability to recruit and retain employees is directly tied to our railroad\u2019s fluidity. Without team members to dispatch or operate trains, our network struggles to provide customers efficient, reliable service. \u00a0 We accelerated recruitment efforts in 2022, requiring\u00a0us to evolve our hiring practices and incorporate innovative strategies. From virtual career fairs to pre-recorded video interviews, we implemented robust recruiting tools to meet candidates where they are and provide an efficient, user-friendly experience through every phase of the recruitment process. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       9\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       9\n     \n\n \n\n       9\n     \n \n       9\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 We've also been aggressive in how we compete\u00a0to attract talent in the marketplace. In particularly hard-to-fill jobs and locations, we offered hiring incentives. These incentives are a mix of travel allowances and relocation bonuses, as well as local hiring bonuses to attract applicants already residing in the communities we serve.\u00a0 \u00a0 We continue driving inclusivity into our hiring process. We\u2019re removing bias by using software tools to confirm gender-neutral language in job postings, as well as providing video demonstrations and visual cues during physical abilities tests. Pre-recorded video interviews allow applicants to participate at a time that works best for their schedule, accommodating those who may have nontraditional schedules.\u00a0 \u00a0 And finally, tapping into those who know us best \u2013 employee referrals played an important part in building our team. The \u201cGreat People Know Great People\u201d employee referral program offers an incentive for each referral hired. In 2022, we hired more than 1,250 referred employees. \u00a0 Further discussion can be found in our \u201cWe Are One\u201d report available on our website. \u00a0 Railroad Security \u2013 Our security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures, including employee training, engagement with our customers, training of emergency responders, and partnerships with numerous federal, state, and local government agencies. While federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents, the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives. \u00a0 UPRR Security Measures \u2013 We maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise. The plan includes four levels of alert status, each with its own set of countermeasures. We employ our own police force, consisting of commissioned and highly-trained officers. The police are certified state law enforcement officers with investigative and arrest powers. The Union Pacific Police Department has achieved accreditation under the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc. (CALEA) for complying with the highest law enforcement standards. Our employees undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federally mandated hazardous materials and security training. We regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs. We maintain the capability to move critical operations to back-up facilities in different locations. \u00a0 We operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day. The center receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, law enforcement, and other government officials. In cooperation with government officials, we monitor both threats and public events, and, as necessary, we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations. We comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law. We design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers. Additionally, in compliance with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) regulations, we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of Rail Security Sensitive Materials with customers and interchange partners. \u00a0 We established a number of our own innovative safety and security-oriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to The Officer on Train program, which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks. Our staff of information security professionals continually assess cybersecurity risks and implement mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment.\u00a0To date, we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       10\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       10\n     \n\n \n\n       10\n     \n \n       10\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Cooperation with Federal, State, and Local Government Agencies \u2013 We work closely on physical and cybersecurity initiatives with government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT);\u00a0the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with its Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and TSA;\u00a0as well as local police departments, fire departments, and other first responders. In connection with new guidance from the TSA, effective January 1, 2022, we were required to report cyber incidents to CISA. Additionally, during 2022, as required by the TSA guidance, we\u00a0performed a cyber vulnerability self-assessment, submitted the results to the TSA, assembled and adopted a cyber incident response plan, and appointed cybersecurity coordinators.\u00a0During 2023, we are required to comply with the second directive\u00a0from the TSA, effective October 18, 2022.\u00a0By February 21, 2023, we are required to develop and implement a cybersecurity implementation plan.\u00a0Afterwards we need to establish a cybersecurity assessment plan that describes how the Company will proactively and regularly assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures as well as identify and resolve device, network, and system vulnerabilities.\u00a0In conjunction with the Association of American Railroads (AAR), we sponsor Ask Rail, a mobile application that\u00a0provides first responders with secure links to electronic information, including commodity and emergency response information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations. We also participate in the National Joint Terrorism Task Force, a multi-agency effort established by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to combat and prevent terrorism. \u00a0 We work with the Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Military Transport Management Command, which monitor shipments entering the UPRR rail network at U.S. border crossings and ports. We were the first railroad in the U.S. to be named a partner in CBP\u2019s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, a partnership designed to develop, enhance, and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain. \u00a0 Cooperation with Customers and Trade Associations\u00a0\u2013 Through TransCAER (Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response), we work with the AAR, the American Chemistry Council, the American Petroleum Institute, and other chemical trade groups to provide communities with preparedness tools, including the training of emergency responders. In cooperation with the FRA and other interested groups, we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials. \u00a0 Sustainable Future \u2013 Union Pacific believes it is important that we act as environmental stewards, reducing emissions and supporting the transition to a more sustainable future. While we work to further reduce our environmental footprint, it is important to note that railroads already are one of the most fuel-efficient means of transportation.\u00a0According to the AAR, moving freight by rail instead of truck reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 75%. Building on rail\u2019s relative emissions benefits over other modes of transportation, we are taking additional actions to reduce our emissions.\u00a0These actions are described in our\u00a0Climate Action Plan on our website. \u00a0 Competition \u2013 see \u201cWe Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers\u201d in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. \u00a0 Key Suppliers \u2013 see \u201cWe Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail\u201d in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. \u00a0 Available Information \u2013 Our Internet website is www.up.com.

(See also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in Legal Proceedings, Item 3.) \u00a0 The operations of the Railroad are subject to the\u00a0regulations of the FRA and other federal and state agencies as well as the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The STB has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic; common carrier service of regulated traffic; freight car compensation; transfer, extension, or abandonment of rail lines; and acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The STB continues its efforts to explore expanding rail regulation and is reviewing proposed rulemaking in various areas, including reciprocal switching and\u00a0commodity exemptions, and has finalized rules creating new procedures for smaller rate complaints that are being reviewed in appellate courts. The STB also continues to explore changes to the methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy and the possible uses of revenue adequacy in regulating railroad rates. The STB posts quarterly reports on rate reasonableness cases,\u00a0maintains a database on service complaints, and has the authority to initiate investigations, among other things. \u00a0 DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and DHS, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, emissions requirements, and equipment standards. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law. \u00a0 Environmental Regulation\u00a0\u2013 We are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment. The statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by various state environmental agencies. The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating wastewater discharges. \u00a0 Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Critical Accounting Estimates \u2013 Environmental, Item 7, and Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. \n    \u00a0\n  ", "time": "00:00:04"}
