{"cik": 32604, "item_1A": "ITEM 1 -\u00a0BUSINESS  Emerson (\u201cthe Company\u201d) is a global technology and software company that provides innovative solutions for customers in a wide range of end markets around the world. Through its leading automation portfolio, Emerson helps process, hybrid and discrete manufacturers optimize operations, protect personnel, reduce emissions and achieve their sustainability goals. Sales by geographic destination in 2023 were: the Americas, 51 percent; Asia, Middle East & Africa, 30 percent (China, 12 percent); and Europe, 19 percent.   Portfolio management is an integral component of Emerson's growth and value creation strategy. Over the past two years, the Company has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and divestitures of non-core businesses. These actions were undertaken to create a higher growth and cohesive industrial technology portfolio as a global automation leader serving a diversified set of end markets. The Company\u2019s recent portfolio actions include the following transactions:  \u2022On October 11, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of National Instruments Corporation (\"NI\") at an equity value of $8.2 billion. NI, which provides software-connected automated test and measurement systems that enable enterprises to bring products to market faster and at a lower cost, had revenues of approximately $1.7\u00a0billion and pretax earnings of approximately $170 mllion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023.  \u2022On May 31, 2023, the Company completed the previously announced sale of a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the former Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone in a $14.0 billion transaction. Emerson received upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.7 billion and a note receivable with a face value of $2.25 billion (which will accrue 5 percent interest payable in kind by capitalizing interest), while retaining a 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The Climate Technologies business, which includes the Copeland compressor business and the entire portfolio of products and services across all residential and commercial HVAC and refrigeration end-markets, had 2022 net sales of approximately $5.0 billion. The new standalone business is named Copeland.    \u2022On October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion. This business had net sales of $630 million in 2022.   \u2022On May 31, 2022 the Company completed the divestiture of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC.   \u2022On May 16, 2022, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"Heritage AspenTech\") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectively, the \u201cEmerson Industrial Software Business\u201d), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (defined as \"AspenTech\" herein). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech had 2023 net sales of $1.04 billion.   Further information regarding acquisition and divestiture activity is set forth in Notes 4 and 5.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This includes reporting financial results for Climate Technologies, InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc as discontinued operations for all periods presented, and the assets and liabilities of Climate Technologies and InSinkErator (prior to completion of the divestitures) as held-for-sale (see Note 5). In addition, as a result of its portfolio transformation, the Company now reports six segments and two business groups, which are highlighted in the table below (see Note 20 for further details). Beginning in 2024, the Company will report NI (which will be renamed Test & Measurement) as a new segment in the Software and Control business group.  1 1 1      INTELLIGENT DEVICESSOFTWARE AND CONTROL \u2022Final Control\u2022Control Systems & Software\u2022Measurement & Analytical\u2022AspenTech\u2022Discrete Automation\u2022Safety & Productivity \u2022Final Control \u2022Control Systems & Software \u2022Measurement & Analytical \u2022AspenTech \u2022Discrete Automation \u2022Safety & Productivity The Company sells products and solutions that support customers in a variety of end markets, including process industries (such as chemical, power & renewables and energy), hybrid industries (life sciences, metals & mining, food & beverage, pulp & paper, and others), discrete industries (including automotive, medical, packaging and semiconductor) and more.

DISTRIBUTION  The principal worldwide distribution channel for a majority of the Company's product offerings is through a direct sales force, while a network of independent sales representatives, and to a lesser extent independent distributors purchasing products for resale, are also utilized.   RAW MATERIALS  The Company's major requirements for basic raw materials include steel, cast iron, electronics, rare earth metals, aluminum and brass; and to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. The Company seeks to have many sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events. In 2023, freight costs and service levels returned to pre-pandemic levels, while the supply chain improved, including the availability of electronic components. Despite market price volatility for certain requirements, the raw materials and various purchased components needed for the Company\u2019s products have generally been available in  3 3 3    sufficient quantities. See Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d  PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES  The Company maintains an intellectual property portfolio it has developed or acquired over a number of years, including patents, trademarks and licenses. The Company also continues to develop or acquire new intellectual property. New patent applications are continuously filed to protect the Company\u2019s ongoing research and development activities and the Company periodically reviews the continued utility of patent assets. The Company\u2019s trademark registrations may be renewed and their duration is dependent upon national laws and trademark use. While this proprietary intellectual property portfolio is important to the Company in the aggregate, management does not regard any of its segments as being dependent on any single patent, trademark registration or license.  BACKLOG \u00a0 The Company\u2019s estimated consolidated order backlog was $7.8 billion and $7.0 billion at September\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion related to AspenTech. Approximately 75 percent of the Company\u2019s consolidated backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, with the remainder substantially over the subsequent two years thereafter. Backlog by business group at September\u00a030, 2023 and 2022 follows (dollars in millions):  \u00a02022\u00a02023\u00a0Intelligent Devices$3,930\u00a04,471\u00a0Software and Control3,058\u00a03,302\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total Backlog$6,988\u00a07,773\u00a0  COMPETITION  The Company's businesses operate in highly competitive markets. The Company competes based on product performance, quality, branding, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. A significant element of the Company's competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost. Although no single company competes directly with Emerson in all of the Company's product lines, various companies compete in one or more product lines with the number of competitors varying by product line. Some competitors have substantially greater sales, assets and financial resources than Emerson and the Company also competes with many smaller companies. Management believes Emerson has a market leadership position in many of its product lines.  REGULATIONS  The Company's operations, products and services are subject to various government regulations, including environmental regulations. Our manufacturing locations generate waste, of which treatment, storage, transportation and disposal are subject to U.S. federal, state, foreign and/or local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. The Company continually works to minimize the environmental impact of its operations through safe technologies, facility design and operating procedures. Compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures (including expenditures for environmental control facilities), earnings or competitive position. However, laws and regulations may be changed, accelerated or adopted that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company and which could negatively impact our operating results. See Item 1A - \"Risk Factors.\"  HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES  Emerson is dedicated to modernizing our workplace culture to meet the needs and expectations of today's workers and attract talent that will help us thrive. In 2023, the Company launched its first-ever employee value proposition, Let's Go, which serves as an invitation to employees and potential employees to join the Company in our bold aspiration to create a healthier, safer, smarter and more sustainable world. We believe the Company\u2019s success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of  4 4 4    key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. The Company's Board of Directors and management oversee various employee initiatives.  The Company supports and develops its employees through global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees\u2019 leadership and professional skills. Leadership development programs include intensive learning programs for new leaders as well as more established leaders. The Company also partners with educational institutions and nonprofit organizations to help prepare current and future workers with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed. To assess and improve employee retention and engagement, the Company surveys employees with the assistance of third-party consultants, and takes actions to address areas of employee concern. In 2023, we initiated a continuous listening strategy, with more than 85 percent of employees participating in the survey and an overall engagement score of 78 percent. The categories of safety, well-being, growth and development, and access to resources and support earned the most favorable scores.   Employee health and safety in the workplace is also one of the Company\u2019s core values. The Corporate Safety Council is led by our Chief Operating Officer and oversees our safety efforts, supported by health and safety committees and leaders that operate at the local site level. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. In 2023, the Company's total recordable rate of injuries was 0.30, and its lost or restricted workday case rate was 0.22 (both measured as the number of incidents per 100 employees).   We have identified other human capital priorities, including, among other things, providing competitive wages and benefits and promoting an inclusive work environment. The Company is committed to efforts to elevate the representation of women and U.S. minorities and foster an inclusive work environment that supports our large global workforce and helps us innovate for our customers. Employee Resource Groups have been created to support our diverse workforce and have grown to over 13,000 members. We also have taken actions to enhance diversity, including setting diversity targets for interview slates and targeted recruiting to increase the representation of women, minorities, U.S. military veterans, individuals with a disability and LGBTQ+ talent within Emerson. In 2021, the Company introduced diversity goals at the leadership level. We continue to make progress on our goals and were named a \u201cBest Employer for Diversity\u201d by Forbes. Overall, women represent 33 percent of our global workforce and 23 percent of leadership positions are held by women. In the U.S., minorities represent 35 percent of our workforce and 21 percent of our leadership positions.   Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. The Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 67,000 employees at September 30, 2023. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable.  A small portion of the Company\u2019s U.S. employees are unionized, while outside the U.S., we have employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.  ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY   Emerson\u2019s global purpose is to drive innovation that makes the world healthier, safer, smarter and more sustainable. Our environmental sustainability strategy is focused on driving progress within our facilities and helping our customers achieve their ESG objectives. In 2021, we appointed Mike Train as Chief Sustainability Officer. This role, part of our Office of the Chief Executive, reflects our focus on sustainability across our company. Under his leadership, Emerson has made significant strides, and we are strengthening our leadership position as our customers and suppliers work to deliver their environmental targets.   In 2022, we set an ambitious target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our value chain by 2045 compared to a 2021 baseline. To set us on the right pathway, we will target net zero operations and a 25 percent reduction of our value chain emissions by 2030, also compared to a 2021 baseline. The Company also added ESG targets, including GHG reduction targets, as a component in the determination of annual bonuses for leadership beginning in 2022. In 2023, we established a goal to achieve zero waste to landfill in our manufacturing facilities by 2032, from a 2022 fiscal year baseline, wherever this is compatible with local conditions and regulations. We also introduced a new Technology and Environmental Sustainability Board committee, which is tasked with overseeing strategy related to technology and R&D, the Company\u2019s product cybersecurity practices and Emerson\u2019s environmental sustainability goals and programs. 5 5 5    Our environmental sustainability strategy is summarized by our \u201cGreening Of, Greening By, Greening With\u201d framework. Greening Of Emerson demonstrates our efforts to improve our internal environmental sustainability performance, including reducing our GHG emissions and energy and water consumption. Greening By Emerson is our approach to delivering technology, solutions and expertise (including through our software offerings) that support and enable our customers\u2019 decarbonization and environmental sustainability efforts. Greening With Emerson reflects how we foster collaboration among stakeholders by participating in environmental sustainability industry forums, partnering to develop innovative solutions, and engaging with governments globally to support sustainability-related policies and regulations.
