The focus areas of our business consist of:  \u2022Secure Networking\u2014Our Secure Networking solutions enable the convergence of networking and security across all edges to provide next-generation firewall (\u201cNGFW\u201d), software-defined wide area network (\u201cSD-WAN\u201d), LAN Edge (Wi-Fi and switch) and secure access service edge (\u201cSASE\u201d). Traditional networking lacks awareness of content, applications, users, devices, location and more. A secure networking approach converges networking and security into a single, accelerated solution. A specially designed operating system and security processors work in concert to improve network performance and security posture while decreasing footprint and power consumption. We derive a majority of product sales from our Core Platform (previously referred to as FortiGate) network security appliances. Core Platform network security appliances include a broad set of built-in security and networking features and functionalities, including firewall, next-generation firewall, secure web gateway, secure sockets layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) inspection, SD-WAN, intrusion prevention system (\u201cIPS\u201d), sandboxing, data leak prevention, virtual private network (\u201cVPN\u201d), switch and wireless controller and wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d) edge. Our network security appliances are managed by our FortiOS network operating system, which provides the foundation for Core Platform security functions. We enhance the performance of our network security appliances from branch to data center by designing and implementing Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (\u201cASIC\u201d) technology within our appliances, enabling us to add security and network functionality with minimal impact to network throughput performance. Along with our secure Wi-Fi access points and switches, Fortinet helps organizations secure their networks across campuses, branches and work from anywhere (\u201cWFA\u201d) deployments. For the Japanese market, we also offer high performance network switches marketed under Alaxala Networks Corporation for data center switching.   FortiOS supports many more secure networking markets and applications than just firewall. These include:  \u2022Network Firewall (\u201cNFW\u201d) \u2022Software-Defined Wide Area Network (\u201cSD-WAN\u201d) \u2022Secure LAN/WLAN (Wi-Fi and Switch) (SD-Branch/Campus) \u2022Secure Access Service Edge (\u201cSASE\u201d) \u2022Universal Zero Trust Network Access (\u201cZTNA\u201d) \u2022Encryption Applications (SSL Inspection, Virtual Private Network (\u201cVPN\u201d), and IPsec Connectivity)   Further each security application has number of customer use cases. For example, Network Firewall has the following use cases:  \u2022Data Center Perimeter NGFW \u2022North\u2013South Internal Segmentation Firewall \u2022Distributed Network Edge Firewall \u2022East\u2013West Micro Segmentation Firewall \u2022Virtual Firewall (\u201cVM\u201d) \u2022Cloud Native Firewall (\u201cCNF\u201d) \u2022Firewall as a Service (\u201cFWaaS\u201d) \u2022Containerized Firewall \u2022Endpoint Firewall \u2022SMB Firewall \u2022Home Firewall  \u2022Zero Trust Access\u2014Our Zero Trust Access solutions enable customers to know and control who and what is on their network, in addition to providing security for WFA.

All these are combined to form the Fortinet Security Fabric, which is an approach to security that consolidates discrete security solutions together into an integrated offering. This integrated approach to security extends across both Fortinet-developed solutions and a broad ecosystem of technology partner solutions and technologies.  ASIC  Our proprietary FortiASIC technology family consists of three processors. First, a Network Processor Generation 7, FortiNP 7 (\u201cNP 7\u201d), which accelerates the processing of firewall traffic and offloads this function from the central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d). Second, a Content Processor Generation 9, FortiCP (\u201cCP 9\u201d), helps the CPU with deep packets inspection functions, such as intrusion prevention and antivirus. Multiple NP7s and CP 9s can be placed in larger firewalls to provide more scale. Third, the central CPU, network processing and content processing functions are all brought together in a single ASIC called the Security Processor Generation 5. These Fortinet Proprietary ASICs, along with off-the-shelf CPU/ASICs, allow our systems to scale from the smallest branch to a hyperscale cloud and run multiple applications at high performance.   The use of ASICs allows our appliances to consolidate security functionality and converge security with a minimal impact to network throughput performance, which we believe delivers a lower total cost of ownership (\u201cTCO\u201d) to our customers. As the security needs and technologies of our end-customers increase, we believe our TCO-driven ASIC approach give our products a competitive advantage against other architectural approaches.  FortiOS  FortiOS, its associated security and networking functions and products that run or are integrated with FortiOS are combined to form the Fortinet Security Fabric. This approach to security ties discrete security solutions together into an integrated offering.  Our proprietary FortiOS operating system provides the foundation for the operation of Core Platform network security appliances, whether physical, virtual, private- or public-cloud based. We make regular enhancements and other updates to FortiOS available through our FortiCare support services.  The convergence of security and networking capabilities provided by the Fortinet Security Fabric are powered and controlled through FortiOS. FortiOS provides (i) multiple layers of security, including a hardened kernel layer providing protection for the Core Platform system, (ii) a network security layer, providing security for end-customers\u2019 network infrastructures and (iii) application content protection, providing security for end-customers\u2019 workstations and applications. FortiOS directs the operations of processors and ASICs and provides system management functions such as command line, graphical user interfaces, multiple network and security topology views.  FortiOS also enables advanced, integrated routing and switching, allowing end-customers to deploy Core Platform devices within a wide variety of networks, as well as providing a direct replacement solution option for legacy switching and routing equipment.

Intellectual Property   We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology. We periodically have discussions with third parties regarding licensing Fortinet\u2019s intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) and have sometimes taken legal action against competitors to protect our IP, and as a result third parties have paid us fees in return for licenses or covenants-not-to-sue related to Fortinet IP. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had 1,285 U.S. and foreign-issued patents and 255 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products, including open source software and other software.  Despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.  Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other IP rights. Third parties have asserted, are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark or other IP rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. Even if third parties offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. In certain instances, we indemnify our end-customers, distributors and resellers against claims that our products infringe the IP of third parties.  Government Regulation  We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, regional, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, product labeling, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, data privacy laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. Many of the laws and regulations that are or may be applicable to our business are changing or being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could adversely impact our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the industry in which we operate. We believe we take reasonable steps designed to ensure we are in compliance with current laws and regulations and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently expect compliance to have a material adverse effect.  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Seasonality  For information regarding seasonality in our sales, see the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Revenue Trends\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Competition   The markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. The principal competitive factors in our markets include: \u00a0 \u2022product security performance, throughput, features, effectiveness, interoperability and reliability; \u2022addition and integration of new networking and security features and technological expertise; \u2022compliance with industry standards and certifications; \u2022price of products and services and total cost of ownership; \u2022brand recognition; \u2022customer service and support across varied and complex customer segments and use cases; \u2022sales and distribution capabilities; \u2022size and financial stability; \u2022breadth of product line; \u2022form factor of the solution; and \u2022other competitive differentiators.  Among others, our competitors include Arista Networks, Inc.(\u201cArista\u201d), Aruba Networks, Inc.(\u201cAruba\u201d), Barracuda Networks, Inc. (\u201cBarracuda\u201d), Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (\u201cCheck Point\u201d), Cisco Systems, Inc. (\u201cCisco\u201d), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (\u201cCrowdStrike\u201d), F5 Networks, Inc. (\u201cF5 Networks\u201d), Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (\u201cHuawei\u201d), Juniper Networks, Inc. (\u201cJuniper\u201d), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (\u201cPalo Alto Networks\u201d), SonicWALL, Inc. (\u201cSonicWALL\u201d), Sophos Group Plc (\u201cSophos\u201d), Trend Micro Incorporated (\u201cTrend Micro\u201d), VMware, Inc. (\u201cVMware\u201d) and Zscaler, Inc. (\u201cZscaler\u201d).  We believe we compete favorably based on our products\u2019 security performance, throughput, reliability, breadth and ability to work together, our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise. Several competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition. Some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. Based in part on these competitive pressures, we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionalities to our products.  Conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, market consolidation, supply chain constraints, price list or discount changes or inflation. The development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete. Our competitors may introduce products that are less costly, provide superior performance, are better marketed, or achieve greater market acceptance than our products. Additionally, our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are better positioned to withstand a significant reduction in capital spending by end-customers, and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. The above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competition may harm our business.  Human Capital Management   As of December\u00a031, 2022, our total headcount was 12,595 employees, approximately 30% of whom were employed in the United States and approximately 70% of whom were employed outside of the United States.   Our employees are the foundation of our innovation and cybersecurity leadership for the benefit of our customers. We understand there is a shortage of highly skilled employees for security companies like ours, and we believe that our success and competitive advantage depends largely on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences. We believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits, and we encourage a culture of fairness and meritocracy. Our compensation programs for our employees include base pay, incentive compensation, opportunities for equity ownership where local statutes allow and employee benefits that promote well-being across different aspects of our employees\u2019 lives, which may include health and welfare insurance, retirement benefits and paid time off. 11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents  As a global company, much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d). Such commitment starts at the top, with a highly skilled and diverse board of directors. As of December\u00a031, 2022, women represented 25% of the members of our board of directors, and approximately 50% of our board of directors was from underrepresented communities. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on enhancing our DEI initiatives across our workforce.   We are also committed to community engagement and social responsibility with regards to our employees and beyond, and our board of directors has active oversight of such initiatives. Examples of our initiatives focused on our employees include our company matching program for employee charitable contributions and the free security training programs we offer to help with career development for our employees, in addition to the general public.  Our culture is defined by our commitment to ethics and integrity. We reinforce our ethical \u201ctone at the top\u201d through clear policies including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, regular compliance training for our employees, quarterly meetings of our cross-functional Ethics Committee, clear messaging from our executives, enforcement of company policies and oversight by our board of directors. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer regularly communicates the importance of Fortinet\u2019s core values of openness, teamwork and innovation.   We are committed to providing our employees a safe and healthy work environment. We sponsor a global wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial and mental wellbeing for all our employees around the world. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through communications, educational sessions, wellness challenges and other incentives.  None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. Our employees in certain European and Latin American countries, however, have the right to be represented by external labor organizations if they maintain up-to-date union membership. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.  Environmental, Social and Governance  We are committed to responsible environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices. This commitment starts with the Social Responsibility Committee of our board of directors providing oversight of our Corporate Social Responsibility (\u201cCSR\u201d) strategy, initiatives and execution related to ESG matters. Our senior leadership sponsors the integration of CSR priorities throughout our business operations. In addition, our Global Head of Sustainability and CSR, along with our internal cross-functional employee CSR Committee, engage with internal and external stakeholders to lead CSR execution, communications and disclosure.  Environmental. We recognize that environmental considerations such as climate change, resource scarcity and the energy crisis are top priorities for the future of our planet. We are committed to helping address climate change impacts and minimizing the environmental footprint of our solutions, operations and our broader value chain. We have engaged with a consultancy to measure our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and to further engage on our path to carbon neutrality in alignment with the Paris Agreement we formally signed on to the Science-Based Target Initiative commitment in September 2022. We implemented an Environmental Management Systems platform to track our energy, water and waste impact, and engaged on the ISO14001 certification process for our company-owned warehouse in Union City, California. We began aligning our climate strategy and disclosures to the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures framework and submitted our Carbon Disclosure Project report. We continue to combine innovation with environmental sustainability to reduce the use of energy, cooling and space required for our solutions, thereby helping our customers minimize power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  Social. We are committed to building an inclusive, equitable and diverse workforce within our organization and across the security industry to help empower individuals to reach their full potential. We continue to focus on skilling, upskilling and reskilling individuals to reach our goal of training one million people in cybersecurity by 2026. At the 2022 White House National Cyber Workforce and Education Summit, we announced the expansion of our existing free training offerings, focusing on schools. We introduced an enhanced enterprise-grade Security Awareness and Training service to help Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d), security and compliance leaders build a cyber-aware culture within their organizations. We continued to expand partnerships with educational institutions and now count over 500 Authorized Academic Partners. Our Education Outreach Program focuses on creating cyber career pathways for underrepresented populations, including women, veterans and disadvantaged individuals. In total, we trained over 210,000 people through our various initiatives in 2022. Internally, we pursue our progress on DEI and have established organizational governance by forming a global DEI Organizing Committee and DEI Council to provide a shared direction and commitment to recruiting and valuing a diverse workforce, fostering a culture of teamwork and openness, and building a more inclusive workplace.  12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents Governance. Our approach to responsible business is based on strong corporate governance practices that aim to ensure accountability while meeting our responsibilities across our value chain. Our board of directors frequently reviews our governance practices to ensure that they are appropriate and reflect our company\u2019s maturity. To promote ethical business practices, we have adopted policies related to proper business conduct and ethics that apply to employees, partners and suppliers, and we have compliance trainings and controls in place. In 2022, we expanded the human rights language in our compliance and business ethics training and updated our supplier and partner codes of conduct to reference our environmental and human rights policies. As part of our engagement with stockholders and our commitment to ESG, we regularly evaluate our corporate governance structure and practices, and have implemented the following measures, among others: majority voting standard for uncontested elections of directors, allowing stockholders to call special meetings of our stockholders, declassification of our board of directors, proxy access and stock ownership guidelines with respect to our non-employee directors.
