We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs and comply with local regulations. U.S. We promote our major products in the U.S. through sales representatives who engage with physicians and other healthcare professionals. We also educate healthcare providers about our products in various other ways, including promoting in online channels, distributing literature and samples of certain products to physicians, and exhibiting at medical meetings. In addition, we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S., and we maintain websites and other media channels with information about our major products. We supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our resources and reach additional patients in need. We maintain special business groups to service wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, government and long-term care institutions, hospitals, and certain retail pharmacies. We enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products. In the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, three wholesale distributors in the U.S.\u2014McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc.\u2014each accounted for a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10\u00a0percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years. For additional information, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 2: Revenue.\" Outside the U.S. The products we market and distribution of our products vary from country to country. Outside the U.S., we promote our products to healthcare providers through sales representatives and other channels. In most countries in which we operate, we maintain our own sales organizations, but in some countries we market our products through third parties, some of which we have engaged through distribution and promotion arrangements. Marketing Collaborations Certain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. For example, we and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global agreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products, including Trajenta\u00ae, Jentadueto\u00ae, Jardiance, Glyxambi\u00ae, Synjardy\u00ae, Trijardy\u00ae XR, and Basaglar.  For additional information, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 4: Collaborations and Other Arrangements.\" Competition Our products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets.  Important competitive factors include effectiveness, safety, and ease of use; formulary placement, price, payer coverage and reimbursement rates, and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; regulatory approvals; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products, processes, modalities, and uses. Most new products or uses that we introduce must compete with other branded, biosimilar, or generic products already on the market or that are later developed by competitors. When competitors introduce new products, uses, or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages, including by developing new modalities, our products become subject to decreased sales volumes, progressive price reductions, or both.  We believe our long-term competitive success depends on discovering and developing (either alone or in collaboration with others) or acquiring innovative, cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers, and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products, and it is possible that our products will be, or will become, uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or uses developed by our competitors. 7 7 7   Generic Pharmaceuticals One of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals. In the U.S., Europe, Japan, and other jurisdictions, the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result, generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do for our branded products in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly, when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product, which can result in the loss of a significant portion of the product's revenue in a very short period of time. Moreover, governments in some countries leverage generic entrants to drive price concessions through the utilization of volume-based procurement bidding and other measures. Further, public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in many cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. Where substitution is mandatory, it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In certain countries outside the U.S., intellectual property protection is weak, and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch.  Biosimilars A number of our products and potential new medicines in our clinical-stage pipeline are biologics. In the U.S., the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and implementing regulations. Competition for Lilly's biologics may be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that, due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic, may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic. Approval by the FDA ultimately depends on many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is \"highly similar\" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Globally, most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-ons to innovator-developed biologics, including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, as well as in Europe and Japan. The patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market. In addition, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet entirely clear, and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing. In the U.S., currently only a biosimilar product that is determined to be \"interchangeable\" by the FDA will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the original biologic product. The FDA requirements for interchangeability are evolving but the FDA has issued several \"interchangeable\" designations for biosimilar products, including for competitive insulin products, and is expected to continue doing so in the future. Regulatory interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve and, therefore, the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty. Biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. While competitors have developed biosimilars that compete with our products, we have developed, and may continue to develop, our own biosimilars.  U.S. Private Sector Dynamics In the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare organizations significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers, and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their market power and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, typically maintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating discounts or rebates in exchange for formulary inclusion and placement. 8 8 8   Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels, and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in negotiations, and compete fiercely for formulary placement, not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy, safety profile, or patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates or other concessions. As payers and pharmaceutical companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and rebates, value-based agreements, where rebates may be based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes, are another tool that has become increasingly prevalent. Cost is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These pressures have negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement, changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing through high deductible plans and higher co-insurance or co-pays. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see \"\u2014Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access\u2014U.S.\" Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights Overview Intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines and uses. We own, have applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products, product uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. In addition, as discussed below, for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. The patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient (the compound patent) for our products, particularly those in major markets such as the U.S., major European countries, and Japan. These patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications, usually filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Patent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the discovery phase of the drug discovery process, which is described in the \"Research and Development\" section below. In general, national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application, which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term: \u2022Patent term adjustment is a statutory right available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). \u2022Patent term restoration is a statutory right provided to U.S. patent holders that claim inventions subject to review by the FDA. To compensate for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the FDA review process, a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration. Patent term restoration is determined by a formula that cannot be calculated until product approval due to the uncertainty of the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the FDA to review an application. There is a five-year cap on any restoration, and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term restoration for patents claiming inventions subject to a local review by a regulatory agency. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval). Also, in Japan, South Korea, Australia, and other jurisdictions, patent terms can be extended up to five years, depending on the length of regulatory review and other factors. 9 9 9   Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals, especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product, often leading to a severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. However, in some cases the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. Changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity. The primary forms of data protection are as follows: \u2022Regulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials. Data package protection prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period of data package protection depends on the country. For example, the period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics as described below), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent. \u2022Under the BPCIA, the FDA has the authority to approve biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the FDA will consider on a case-by-case basis. Under the data protection provisions of this law, the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, subject to certain conditions.  \u2022In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period. If granted, this \"pediatric exclusivity\" provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data protection and, for products other than biologics, to the term of any relevant patents, to the extent these protections have not already expired. While the term of the pediatric exclusivity begins upon the expiration of the relevant patent, pediatric exclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity\u2014i.e., a bar to generic or biosimilar approval, not a patent right. \u2022Under the U.S. orphan drug law, a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive \"orphan\" designation if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or affecting more than 200,000\u00a0people but not reasonably expected to recover its development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Among other benefits, orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity, meaning that the FDA cannot (with limited exceptions) approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven-year period. Unlike pediatric exclusivity, the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs in parallel with any applicable patents. Outside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely, and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents that we receive for our products. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) Agreement administered by the World Trade Organization, more than 140 countries have agreed to provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners. Certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of \"flexibilities\" allowed under the TRIPs Agreement. Thus, some types of patents, such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules, are not available in certain developing countries. Further, many developing countries, and some developed countries, do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in the TRIPs Agreement.  Our Intellectual Property Portfolio We consider intellectual property protection for certain products, processes, uses, and formulations\u2014particularly with respect to those products discussed below\u2014to be important to our operations. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below, we may hold patents on manufacturing processes, formulations, devices, or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below. For approved products, dates include, where applicable, pending or granted patent term extensions. 10 10 10   The most relevant U.S. patent protection or data protection and associated expiry dates for our major or recently launched patent-protected marketed products are as follows: \u2022Cyramza is protected by a compound patent and biologics data protection (2026). \u2022Emgality is protected by a compound patent (2033) and biologics data protection (2030). \u2022Jardiance, and the related combination product Glyxambi, is protected by a compound patent (2028). \u2022Jaypirca is protected by a compound patent (2037) and by data protection (2028).  \u2022Mounjaro is protected by a compound patent (2036) and by data protection (2027). \u2022Olumiant is protected by a compound patent (2032).  \u2022Retevmo is protected by a compound patent (2037) and by data protection (2025). \u2022Reyvow\u00ae is protected by a compound patent (2030). \u2022Taltz is protected by a compound patent (2030) and by biologics data protection (2028). \u2022Trulicity is protected by a compound patent (2027) and by biologics data protection (2027). \u2022Verzenio is protected by a compound patent (2031). Outside the U.S., important patent protection or data protection includes:  \u2022Baqsimi\u00ae is protected by data protection in Japan (2026). \u2022Cyramza is protected by a compound patent (2028) and by data protection (2024) in major European countries, and by a compound patent (2026) and by data protection (2023) in Japan. \u2022Emgality is protected by a compound patent (2033) and by data protection (2028) in major European countries, and by a compound patent (2035) and by data protection (2029) in Japan. \u2022Jardiance is protected by a compound patent in major European countries (2029) and Japan (2030). \u2022Mounjaro is protected by a compound patent in major European countries (2037) and Japan (2040). \u2022Olumiant is protected by a compound patent (2032) and by data protection (2027) in major European countries, and by a compound patent (2033) and by data protection (2025) in Japan. \u2022Retevmo is protected by a compound patent (2037) and by data protection (2031) in major European countries, and by a compound patent (2038) and by data protection (2029) in Japan. \u2022Reyvow is protected by data protection (2032) in major European countries, and a compound patent (2028) and by data protection (2032) in Japan. \u2022Taltz is protected by a compound patent (2031) and data protection (2027) in major European countries and a compound patent (2030) and data protection (2024) in Japan. \u2022Trulicity is protected by a compound patent (2029) and by data protection (2024) in major European countries and by a compound patent (2029) and by data protection (2023) in Japan. \u2022Verzenio is protected by a compound patent (2033) and data protection (2028) in major European countries and by a compound patent (2034) and data protection (2026) in Japan. The following product candidates are the most relevant currently under regulatory review. Upon approval, we expect relevant compound patent and data protections to apply: \u2022Donanemab has been submitted for regulatory review in the U.S. for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease. In January 2023, the FDA issued a complete response letter for our accelerated approval submission. Phase III trials are ongoing. \u2022Lebrikizumab has been submitted for regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. \u2022Mirikizumab has been submitted for regulatory review in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. 11 11 11   Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks consisting of our product names, logos, and unique product appearances (e.g., the appearance of our Trulicity autoinjector) that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the world, with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used, and in other countries as long as it is registered. Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms. Trademark protection typically extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product.  Patent Licenses and Collaborations Most of our major products are not subject to significant license and collaboration agreements. For information on our license and collaboration agreements, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 4: Collaborations and Other Arrangements.\"  Patent Challenges  In the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics, which are discussed below in more detail) when the generic manufacturer has not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA, the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only \"pharmaceutical equivalence\" and \"bioequivalence\" between the generic version and the New Drug Application (NDA)-approved-drug, not safety and efficacy. Establishing pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company. Absent a patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator's patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator's NDA are invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a \"Paragraph IV certification.\" If the innovator responds by filing suit against the generic manufacturer, the FDA is then prohibited from approving the generic company's application for a 30-month period (which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge). If one or more of the NDA-listed patents are challenged, the first filer(s) of a Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers. Generic manufacturers use Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In addition, generic companies have shown willingness to launch \"at risk,\" i.e., after receiving ANDA approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge. Under the BPCIA, the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires, 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved. However, the BPCIA does provide a mechanism for a prospective biosimilar competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator's patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic.  The patent litigation scheme under the BPCIA, and the BPCIA itself, is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA, as well as by courts. Courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the BPCIA patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration. Further, in the U.S., the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. See also \"\u2014Competition\u2014Biosimilars.\" In addition, there is a procedure in U.S. patent law, known as inter partes review (IPR), which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the review of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court. In addition, the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court. Generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the IPR process in attempts to invalidate our patents. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators. We have also observed, and may continue to observe, changes at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), including with respect to the PTAB's policy to discretionarily deny an otherwise meritorious petition for IPR in light of a concurrent district court proceeding. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014Our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be adversely affected.\" 12 12 12   Outside the U.S., the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely. In recent years, we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the U.S. For more information on administrative challenges and litigation involving our intellectual property rights, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 16: Contingencies.\"  Government Regulation of Our Operations Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national, state, and local agencies.  Regulation of Products  The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing development, and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals of our products is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions and revenue generation. In addition, our operations are subject to complex federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare providers and suppliers, the environment, occupational health and safety, data privacy, and other matters. Evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations, including with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), quality assurance, and similar regulations. Compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery, development, and introduction of new products and uses will continue to require substantial effort, expense, and capital investment. Of particular importance to our business is regulation by the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to laws and regulations that include the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, quality control, distribution, labeling, marketing, promotion, advertising, dissemination of information, and post-marketing surveillance of those products and devices. Following approval, our products remain subject to regulation by various agencies in connection with labeling, import, export, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, and safety reporting. We conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after a product reaches the market. The FDA also strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.  Outside the U.S., our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements, notably by the EMA in Europe, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan, and the National Medical Products Administration in China. Specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country. Regulatory and compliance requirements, as well as approval processes outside the U.S., may differ from those in the U.S. and may involve additional costs, uncertainties, and risks. The FDA and other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. extensively regulate all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under their cGMP regulations. We make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive, company-wide quality systems and controls in our manufacturing, product development, and process development operations in an effort to maintain sustained compliance with cGMP and other regulations. However, in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements, we become subject to potential government investigations, regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect our business. Certain of our products are manufactured by third parties, and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us, including through failure to supply product to us or delays in approvals of new products or indications. Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business and reputation.  We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations that may affect our research, development or production efforts.  13 13 13   Emergency Use Authorizations The Secretary of Health and Human Services may issue an EUA to authorize unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products, to be manufactured, marketed, and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government. An EUA terminates when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates, and EUAs can be revoked under other circumstances, the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict. Outside the U.S., the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that vary and differ from those in the U.S. The COVID-19 pandemic has been designated as a national emergency in the U.S. On the basis of such determination, the FDA granted EUAs for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together, certain COVID-19-related uses of baricitinib, and bebtelovimab, and similar actions have been taken by other regulators in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. However, the FDA has revised, and may in the future further revise, these EUAs in response to the changing conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the prevalence of variants against which our antibodies have varying degrees of efficacy. In May and November 2022, respectively, the FDA announced that bamlanivimab and etesevimab are, and bebtelovimab is, not currently authorized for emergency use for any U.S. region. Other Laws and Regulations The marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws, as well as analogous foreign laws and regulations, including the federal anti-kickback statute, the False Claims Act, and state laws governing kickbacks, false claims, unfair trade practices, and consumer protection. These laws are administered by, among others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Personnel Management, and state attorneys general. State, federal, and foreign governments, agencies, and other regulatory bodies are active in their oversight, enforcement activities, and coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies, which has resulted in intensified scrutiny, litigation costs, corporate criminal sanctions, and substantial civil settlements in the pharmaceutical industry.  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits certain individuals and entities, including U.S. publicly traded companies, from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above, our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with officials outside the U.S. Additionally, in many countries outside the U.S., healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA.  In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. In recent years, several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area, increased their enforcement activities, and/or increased the level of cross-border coordination and information sharing. We are, and could in the future become, subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages under the False Claims Act), criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from U.S. federal and other healthcare programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position in any given period. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations that may affect our research, development, or production efforts.  14 14 14   Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access  U.S. There continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. In addition, U.S. government actions to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products.  In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA will require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices apply nine (medicines approved under an NDA) or thirteen (medicines approved under a Biologics License Application) years following initial FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. It is too soon to tell how the U.S. government will set these prices as the law specifies a ceiling price, but not a minimum or floor price. One or more of our significant products may be selected, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to patent expiry. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. The establishment of payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards and other state level actors would similarly impact us. Other IRA provisions provide for rebate obligations on drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D medicines at a rate greater than the rate of inflation and Part D benefit redesign that includes replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant. The IRA takes effect progressively starting in 2023, with the first government-set prices effective in 2026. The IRA may meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under an NDA may reduce the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The implications to us of a competitor\u2019s product being selected for price setting are also uncertain. Provisions of the IRA may be subject to legal challenges or other reformation, and the full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. Heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers price their marketed products has also resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, courts, or private payers could also adversely impact our business and financial results. For example, in April 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued the Monoclonal Antibodies Directed Against Amyloid for the Treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease national coverage determination (the Alzheimer's Monoclonal Antibody NCD) limiting coverage of FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease for people with Medicare only if they are enrolled in qualifying clinical trials. In its current form, the Alzheimer\u2019s Monoclonal Antibody NCD would result in significantly reduced coverage for, and negatively impact, our product candidate donanemab, and may negatively impact our business and financial results. Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by the U.S. Congress, the current U.S. presidential administration, and regulatory authorities worldwide, could intensify these efforts and adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. 15 15 15   In the U.S., we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under various federal and state healthcare programs, including state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care programs (minimum of 23.1 percent plus adjustments for price increases above the consumer price index over time) and discounts to private entities who treat patients in certain types of healthcare facilities intended to serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B covered entities). Additionally, an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. Since 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act has required manufacturers of brand-name drugs, biologics, and biosimilars to provide a discount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants who are in the \"doughnut hole\" (the coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage). Beginning in October 2024, under the IRA the 70 percent discount will be replaced by a 10 percent discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and incurred out of pocket drug costs below a $2,000 threshold and a 20 percent discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2,000 threshold. Rebates are also negotiated in the private sector. We pay rebates to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare and to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to their customers. These rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class. Our approach to the rebates we offer to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare may be impacted by the 2020 regulatory amendments to the anti-kickback statute's discount safe harbor, which have currently been stayed until at least January 1, 2032.  For a discussion of risks related to how we price our products, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014We face litigation and investigations related to our products, how we price our products, and how we commercialize our products; we could face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business, and we are self-insured for such matters.\" Outside the U.S. Globally, public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value, including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition, third-party organizations, including professional associations, academic institutions, and non-profit entities associated with payers, conduct and publish comparative effectiveness and cost/benefit analyses on medicines, the impact of which are uncertain.  In most international markets, we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs, which may include price controls, international reference pricing (to other countries' prices), discounts and rebates, therapeutic reference pricing (to other, often generic, pharmaceutical choices), restrictions on physician prescription levels, and mandatory generic substitution. In October 2022, the German Parliament passed cost cutting reforms and these reforms were followed by activation of a clawback mechanism in France and implementation of increased mandatory rebates in the United Kingdom. These changes may be followed in 2023 by biopharmaceutical-focused austerity measures in more countries in Europe and in other markets. Reforms, including those that may stem from periods of economic downturn or uncertainty, or as a result of high inflation, emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest (including the Russia-Ukraine war), or government budgeting priorities (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic), may continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products. We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative, regulatory, or payer developments. However, in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing, resulting in additional state, federal, and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis\u2014Executive Overview\u2014Other Matters\u2014Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access\" for additional information regarding recent legislative, administrative, and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results. 16 16 16   Research and Development Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years. We invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2022, we employed approximately 9,000 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities, including a substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees, and highly skilled technical personnel.  Our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of obesity & diabetes, immunology, neuroscience, and oncology. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also focused on researching and developing potential treatments for COVID-19. In addition to discovering and developing new medicines, we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses, formulations, and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients. To supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others, including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines. We also invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including, among others, licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments. Pharmaceutical development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade. Candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. The following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products: Phases of New Drug Development \u2022Discovery Phase In the discovery phase, scientists identify, design, and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets thought to play a role in disease. Targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to the next phase of development, which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans. The discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low. \u2022Early Development Phase Early development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements. Safety testing is initially performed in laboratory tests and animals, as necessary. In general, the first human tests (often referred to as Phase I) are conducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range. Subsequently, larger populations of patients are studied (Phase II) to identify initial signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety. In parallel, scientists work to identify safe, effective, and economical manufacturing processes. Long-term animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues. Of the candidates that enter the early development phase, approximately 10 percent move to the late development phase. The early development phase varies but can take several years to complete. \u2022Late Development Phase Late phase development projects (typically Phase III) have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier studies. As a result, these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the disease. These studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitive therapies, placebo, or both. Phase III studies are generally conducted globally and are designed to support regulatory filings for marketing approval. The duration of Phase III testing varies by disease and may take two to four years. 17 17 17   \u2022Submission Phase Once a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies, the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years, depending on the disease state, the strength and complexity of available data, the degree of unmet need, and the time required for the regulatory agency(ies) to evaluate the submission, which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors. There is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval, or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas. We believe our investments in research, both internally and in collaboration with others, have resulted in a robust pipeline of potential new medicines and new treatment indications in all stages of development. We have a number of new medicine candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review, and we have a larger number of projects in the discovery phase. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis\u2014Executive Overview\u2014Late-Stage Pipeline,\" for more information on our late-stage product candidates. Raw Materials and Product Supply Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However, we obtain certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source. We generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented, in the event one of these suppliers becomes unable to provide the materials or product. However, various developments have led, and may in the future lead, to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new sources, implement alternative processes, bring new manufacturing facilities online, or pause or discontinue product sales in one or more markets. The majority of our revenue comes from products produced predominantly in our own facilities. Our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and Ireland. Finishing operations, including formulation, filling, assembling, delivery device manufacturing, and packaging, take place at a number of sites throughout the world. We utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations. We manage our supply chain (including our own facilities, contracted arrangements, and inventory) in a way that is intended to allow us to meet substantially all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. To maintain supply of our products, we use a variety of techniques, including comprehensive quality systems, inventory management, and back-up sites. However, pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures, process modifications, and regulatory approvals. Accordingly, developments such as unplanned plant shutdowns, manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at one of our facilities or contracted facilities, failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, increases in demand on a supplier, or difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors have led, and may in the future lead, to interruption or higher costs in the supply of certain products, product shortages, or pauses or discontinuations of product sales in one or more markets. Further, global transportation and logistics challenges, cost inflation, and tight labor markets, have caused, and in the future may cause, delays in and/or increased costs related to distribution of our medicines, the construction or acquisition of manufacturing capacity, procurement activity, and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. For more information on the additional risks we face in connection with any difficulties, disruptions, and shortages in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our products, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014Manufacturing, quality, or supply chain difficulties, disruptions, or shortages could lead to product supply problems.\" In addition, cost inflation, the strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest, including the Russia-Ukraine war), global economic downturns or uncertainty, and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials have had, and may continue to have, a number of impacts on our business, including increased costs and disruptions in the supply of our medicines. For more information, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014Public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our business and operations.\" and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis\u2014Executive Overview\u2014Other Matters\u2014COVID-19 Pandemic.\" 18 18 18   Quality Assurance Our success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality requires a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations, including research and development, purchasing, facilities planning, manufacturing, distribution, and dissemination of information about our medicines.  Quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients, equipment, facilities, manufacturing methods, packaging materials, and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to ensure that the product meets all applicable regulatory requirements and our internal standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals, or a combination thereof. Additional assurance of quality is provided by quality assurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to pharmaceutical manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at third-party suppliers. Executive Officers of the Company The following table sets forth certain information regarding our current executive officers. The term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors, to be held on May 1, 2023 in connection with the company's annual meeting of shareholders, or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified. No director or executive officer has a \"family relationship\" with any other director or executive officer of the company, as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement. There is no understanding between any executive officer or director and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected. 19 19 19   NameAgeTitles and Business ExperienceDavid Ricks55Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (since 2017).

We believe the strength of our workforce significantly contributes to our financial performance and enables us to make life better for people around the world. For instance, most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists, and our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative medicines. We believe that fostering a positive culture that values the contributions of our talented colleagues helps drive our success. We are committed to creating a safe, supportive, ethical, and rewarding work environment through strategic focus on our human capital management process, fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices, robust training and development opportunities, and competitive pay and benefits. We believe our dedication to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within our company reflects our values and is a key driver of business success and growth.  We regularly conduct anonymous employee surveys to seek feedback from our workforce on a variety of topics. These results are reviewed and analyzed by our leaders to identify opportunities to adjust our policies and benefits to improve our employees' experience. As a result of our efforts, we believe that we have a highly performing, cohesive workforce and that our employee relations are good. At the end of 2022, we employed approximately 39,000 people, including approximately 21,000 employees outside the U.S. Our employees include approximately 9,000 people engaged in research and development activities. Strategy and Oversight In order to build diverse and inclusive teams, our CEO and executive committee set expectations for inclusive leadership and hold leaders accountable for achieving results. Because dedication to human capital management is also a core component of our corporate governance, our board of directors regularly engages with management and facilitates a system of reporting designed to monitor human capital management initiatives and progress as part of the overarching framework that guides how we attract, retain, engage, and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and mission.  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion We are committed to fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices, and we deeply value diverse backgrounds, skills, and global perspectives. To fulfill our purpose, we believe we must look at challenges from multiple viewpoints and understand the diverse experiences of the patients who depend on us.  We believe that fostering DEI begins with understanding. For example, our Employee Journeys research has yielded important insights about the experiences of women, Black/African American, Latinx, Asian, and LGBTQ+ employees at Lilly. The results of this research are reviewed by our senior leadership, and we deploy actions and activities in response to these insights to improve our workplace and corporate culture. In 2020, as part of our DEI and community initiatives, Lilly and the Lilly Foundation launched the Racial Justice Commitment, with Lilly pledging 25,000 volunteer hours and the Lilly Foundation committing $25 million over five years to help decrease the burden of racial injustice and its effects on communities of color. The Racial Justice Commitment aims to drive change across five areas: internal people development, health equity, social impact, diversity partners, and family sustaining jobs, through the use of financial and people resources. From 2020 through 2022, we have made progress in these efforts, including nearly tripling our spending with Black-owned businesses, committing over $98 million in minority-led venture capital firms, serving over 30,000 volunteer hours to advance racial justice initiatives, and expanding our Skills First Program at Lilly for individuals without four-year college degrees. Since 2017, we have committed to increasing women, Black/African American, Latinx, and Asian representation in leadership roles, and we actively monitor our progress. From the end of 2018 through the end of 2022, we increased the percentage of women in management globally from 42 percent to 49 percent. For minority group members (MGM) in the U.S. over the same period, we increased management representation from 19 percent to 25 percent. Across all levels of our workforce, from the end of 2018 through the end of 2022, we have seen increased representation for MGMs in the U.S. and women globally. Our focus on DEI is also evident at our executive committee and board of directors. Five of 15 current members (approximately 33 percent) of our executive committee (which includes our CEO) are women and three are MGMs. In addition, as of the filing of this report, the company's 13-member board of directors includes five women and six members who are MGMs. 21 21 21   Our efforts in DEI and workplace benefits have garnered numerous recognitions, including, in 2022, Top 50 Companies for Diversity by DiversityInc., Top Companies for Board of Directors by DiversityInc., Top Companies for Supplier Diversity by DiversityInc., Top Companies for ESG by DiversityInc., America's Best Employers for Women by Forbes, Perfect Score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Corporate Equality Index, World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, Perfect Score on Disability Equity Index Best Places to Work by Disability:IN, Pharmaceutical Innovation Index, Zero Project Award for Access Lilly, and Top Companies for Executive Women, Best Companies for Multicultural Women, Best Companies for Dads, 70 percent and Higher Inclusion Index by Seramount. Employee Development We believe attracting and retaining the best, diverse talent begins with the hiring process. We therefore require hiring managers to consider a diverse pool of candidates and we strive to provide a diverse panel of interviewers for open positions. We believe that hiring in this way helps ensure that people from all backgrounds have equal opportunity to advance their careers. In early 2022, we launched Discover, a 12-month new employee onboarding program with multiple touchpoints designed to foster integration into Lilly, to accelerate learning in their new roles and to create connections to further a sense of belonging at Lilly. Discover was shaped in part by external benchmarking, feedback from employees, and learnings from onboarding remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. We offer training to enable our employees to perform their duties in our highly regulated industry. We also strive to cultivate a culture that promotes ongoing learning by encouraging employees to seek further education and growth experiences, helping them build rewarding careers. We have introduced online programming to facilitate access to our learning and development offerings in addition to our in-person programs. Many training courses are designed to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and other unique needs. Across Lilly, we are continuously working to design learning experiences to be more inclusive and effective. In addition, we have implemented development tools and resources for all employees, improved our talent programs and processes to provide broader access to information, and increased transparency regarding career development and advancement at Lilly. Employee resource groups (ERGs) are another important component of developing talent at Lilly. We currently have 11 ERGs representing groups including women, MGMs, LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, and people with disabilities. ERGs offer our diverse workforce opportunities to build relationships, engage with senior leaders, advance our caring community, and offer unique insights and perspectives to improve our business.  We have continued our efforts to create an inclusive workplace with the goal of ensuring that all employees feel safe to speak up and share their ideas at work. Our Make it Safe to Thrive education and awareness program is designed to help employees and leaders understand how individual psychological safety can be created and enhanced and includes live and online training. In late 2022, we introduced a new version of Make it Safe to Thrive for leaders that continues to focus on psychological safety and creating an inclusive environment. Leaders are provided the opportunity to work through challenging conversations and situations currently being navigated in the workplace. Lilly is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and respect in the workplace\u2014an environment free of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation of any kind. In 2022, as part of our annual review of The Red Book and related policies and procedures, we revised the Global Conduct in the Workplace procedure to continue to help ensure that we maintain a respectful, safe, inclusive, and professional workplace. Employee Health and Safety We strive to foster a healthy, vibrant work environment, which includes keeping our employees safe. We seek to create a companywide culture where best-in-class safety practices are consistently followed. To do this, we assess and continuously attempt to improve our companywide safety performance to promote the well-being of employees and to help safeguard communities where we operate. As the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, we have continued to take various measures (as necessary) to protect and support the health and safety of our employees globally. We believe a holistic approach and dedication to safety helps us be our best as we deliver on our company purpose to improve lives around the world. 22 22 22   Information Available on Our Website Our company website is www.lilly.com.
