{"cik": 1138118, "item_1A": "Item 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business.  Company Overview CBRE Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. References to \u201cCBRE,\u201d \u201cthe company,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to CBRE Group, Inc. and include all of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise. We are the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2022\u00a0revenue, with leading global market positions in our leasing, property sales, occupier outsourcing and valuation businesses. As of December\u00a031, 2022, the company had approximately 115,000\u00a0employees (excluding Turner & Townsend Holdings Limited employees) serving clients in more than 100\u00a0countries. We provide services to real estate investors and occupiers. For investors, our services include capital markets (property sales and mortgage origination), mortgage sales and servicing, property leasing, investment management, property management, valuation and development services, among others. For occupiers, our services include facilities management, project management, transaction (property sales and leasing) and consulting services, among others. We provide services under the following brand names: \u201cCBRE\u201d (real estate advisory and outsourcing services); \u201cCBRE Investment Management\u201d (investment management); \u201cTrammell Crow Company\u201d (primarily U.S. development); \u201cTelford Homes\u201d (U.K. development); and \u201cTurner & Townsend Holdings Limited\u201d (Turner & Townsend). We generate revenue from stable, recurring sources (large multi-year portfolio and per project contracts) and from cyclical, non-recurring sources, including commissions on transactions. Our revenue mix has become heavily weighted towards stable revenue sources, particularly occupier outsourcing, and our dependence on highly cyclical property sales and lease transaction revenue has declined. We believe we are well-positioned to capture a substantial and growing share of market opportunities at a time when investors and occupiers increasingly prefer to purchase integrated, account-based services on a national and global basis.  In 2022, we generated revenue from a highly diversified base of clients, including more than 95 of the Fortune 100 companies. We have been an S&P 500 company since 2006 and in 2022 we were ranked #126 on the Fortune 500. We have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in the Lipsey Company survey for 22\u00a0years in a row (including 2022). We have also been rated a World\u2019s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute for nine consecutive years (including 2022, the most recent year the award has been announced) and have been included in the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index for four years in a row and the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for four years in a row (including 2023).  CBRE History We will mark our 117th\u00a0year of continuous operations in 2023, tracing our origins to a company founded in San\u00a0Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake. Since then, we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services and investment firm (in terms of 2022 revenue) through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, including our acquisition of a majority interest in Turner & Townsend in November 2021.  Our Business Segments and Primary Services CBRE Group, Inc. is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries. CBRE Group, Inc. does not have any independent operations or employees. CBRE Services, Inc., our direct wholly owned subsidiary, is also a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our long-term indebtedness. We report our operations through the following reportable segments: (1) Advisory Services, (2) Global Workplace Solutions, and (3) Real Estate Investments. In addition, we also have a Corporate and other segment. 1 1 1  Table of Contents Table of Contents Advisory Services Advisory Services provides a comprehensive range of services globally, including property leasing, capital markets (property sales and mortgage origination), mortgage sales and servicing, property management and valuation. Most of our Advisory Services operations are conducted through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary CBRE,\u00a0Inc. and its subsidiaries around the world. Our mortgage services, the vast majority of which are in the United States (U.S.), are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the name CBRE\u00a0Capital Markets, Inc. (CBRE\u00a0Capital Markets) and its affiliates. The primary services within Advisory Services are further described below. Leasing Services We provide strategic advice and execution for owners/investors, and occupiers/tenants of real estate, primarily in connection with the leasing of office, industrial and retail space. In 2022, we negotiated leases valued at more than $165.0\u00a0billion globally. We generate significant business from account-based occupier clients, where we are retained to negotiate leases for all or a portion of their portfolio. This results in recurring revenue over time. We believe we are the market leader for leasing services to both occupiers and owners in most leading U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), including Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Denver, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Phoenix, San Francisco, Seattle and St. Louis. Capital Markets and Mortgage Services  We provide property sales and mortgage services, which are closely integrated to meet marketplace demand for comprehensive capital markets solutions. During 2022, we closed approximately $290.2 billion of property sales transactions globally. We are the leading property sales advisor globally. In the U.S., we accounted for approximately 15.6% of investment sales transactions greater than $2.5 million across all property types in 2022, according to Real Capital Analytics. Our mortgage brokerage professionals arrange, originate and service commercial mortgage loans through relationships established with investment banking firms, national and regional banks, credit companies, insurance companies, U.S.\u00a0Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), and pension funds. In the U.S., our loan origination and sales volume in 2022 was $62.7 billion, including approximately $13.6\u00a0billion for U.S. GSEs. Most of the GSE loans were financed through revolving warehouse credit lines through a CBRE subsidiary that is dedicated exclusively for this purpose and were substantially risk mitigated by either obtaining a contractual purchase commitment from the GSE or confirming a forward-trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage-backed security to be secured by the loan. We also oversee a loan servicing portfolio, which totaled approximately $381.2 billion globally at year-end 2022. In many countries that we operate in (including the U.S.), our real estate services professionals (both leasing and capital markets) are compensated primarily through commissions, which are payable upon completion of an assignment. This mitigates the effect of compensation, our largest expense, on our operating margins during difficult market conditions. We strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity as well as investments in support resources, including professional development and training, market research and data/information, technology, branding and marketing. Property Management Services We provide property management services on a contractual basis, primarily for owners of and investors in office, industrial and retail properties. These services include marketing, building engineering, lease administration, accounting and financial services. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we managed 2.9 billion square feet of properties globally for property owners/investors. We are compensated for our services through a monthly management fee earned based on either a specified percentage of the monthly rental income, rental receipts generated from the property under management or a fixed fee. We are also often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs directly attributable to the properties under management. Our management agreements with our property management services clients may be terminated by either party with notice generally ranging between 30 to 90 days; however, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and the typical  2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents contract continues for multiple years. We believe our contractual relationships with these clients put us in an advantageous position to provide other services to them, including leasing, refinancing, disposition and appraisal. Valuation Services We provide valuation services that include market-value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses, feasibility studies as well as consulting services such as property condition reports, hotel advisory and environmental consulting. Our valuation business has developed proprietary systems for data management, analysis and valuation report preparation, which we believe provide us with an advantage over our competitors. We believe that our valuation business is one of the largest in the commercial real estate industry. During 2022, we completed over 667,249 valuation, appraisal and advisory assignments globally, including residential valuations in Asia Pacific.  Global Workplace Solutions Global Workplace Solutions provides a broad suite of integrated, contractually based outsourcing services to occupiers of real estate, including facilities management and project management. We also offer account-based Advisory services, particularly leasing, property sales and portfolio administration, for Global Workplace Solutions clients.  We believe the outsourcing of corporate real estate services is a long-term trend, with multi-national corporations, and other large occupiers of space utilizing global, full-service real estate firms to achieve better workplaces for their people, while endeavoring to lower their cost of occupancy. We typically enter into multi-year, often multi-service, outsourcing contracts with services delivered via dedicated account teams and/or an on-demand basis. The key outsourcing services offered through this business segment are described below. Facilities Management Services Facilities management services involves the day-to-day management of client-occupied space for traditional office space, such as headquarter buildings, regional offices and administrative offices, as well as facilities serving specialized industries, such as data centers, life science and medical facilities, distribution warehouses, government facilities and retail stores. Contracts for facilities management services are often structured so that we are reimbursed for client-dedicated personnel costs and subcontracted vendor costs as well as associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives tied to agreed-upon performance targets, with any penalties typically capped. These are referred to as cost-plus contracts. In addition, we have contracts for facilities management services based on fixed-fee unit prices or guaranteed maximum prices. Fixed-fee contracts are typically structured where an agreed-upon scope of work is delivered for a fixed price while guaranteed maximum price contracts are structured with an agreed upon scope of work that will be provided to the client for a not-to-exceed price. We furnish facilities management services to clients with single or multiple-location assets as well as regional, national and global portfolios. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we managed approximately 4.4 billion square feet of facilities on behalf of occupiers. Our facilities management services are managed across three sub-lines of business \u2013 enterprise, local and data center services \u2013 by client type. Cost-plus contracts are most common for enterprise customers while fixed-price contracts are predominately for local and data center clients.  Project Management Services Project management services can be provided on a one-off or programmatic basis to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in markets around the world. Revenues from project management services generally include fixed management fees, variable fees, lump sum and incentive fees if certain agreed-upon performance targets are met. Revenues from project management may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services and subcontracted vendor costs. In 2022, CBRE was directly responsible for implementing more than 52,000 projects with a combined contract value of approximately $148.0 billion. Our majority-owned subsidiary, Turner & Townsend, which was acquired in November 2021, plays a key role in providing cost, project, program management and project controls for a broad range of clients across the infrastructure, real estate and natural resources sectors. Turner & Townsend was involved in more than 5,000 projects in 2022 with an aggregate capital value of approximately $1.1\u00a0trillion. 3 3 3  Table of Contents Table of Contents Real Estate Investments Real Estate Investments includes: (i)\u00a0investment management services provided globally and (ii)\u00a0development services in the U.S., United Kingdom (U.K.) and Continental Europe. Investment Management Services Investment management services are conducted through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, CBRE Investment Management, LLC (CBRE Investment Management) and its global affiliates. CBRE Investment Management provides investment management services to pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments and other institutional investors seeking to generate returns and diversification through investment in real assets such as real estate, infrastructure, master limited partnerships and other assets. We sponsor investment programs that span the risk/return spectrum in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. In some strategies, CBRE Investment Management and its investment teams co-invest with its limited partners. Increasingly, real estate assets we are developing through our development services business are being placed into CBRE investment management strategies creating greater operational synergies among the Real Estate Investments businesses. CBRE Investment Management manages real assets investments across five principal investment categories: (1) Private Direct Real Estate, through which CBRE Investment Management invests directly into properties; (2) Private Indirect Real Estate, through which CBRE Investment Management invests with specialist managers and operators in funds, programmatic ventures, joint ventures, and other indirect investment formats; (3) Listed Real Assets, through which CBRE Investment Management invests in public market real estate and infrastructure securities; (4) Private Infrastructure, through which CBRE Investment Management invests both directly and indirectly in infrastructure companies, projects, and ventures; and (5) Real Estate Credit, through which CBRE Investment Management manages loan portfolios backed by underlying real estate.  Across these investment categories, CBRE Investment Management manages capital both through commingled fund strategies and custom separate account implementations. Assets under management (AUM) totaled $149.3\u00a0billion at December\u00a031, 2022 as compared to $141.9\u00a0billion at December\u00a031, 2021, an increase of $7.4\u00a0billion ($13.1\u00a0billion in local currency). Development Services Development services are conducted through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary Trammell Crow Company, LLC, which provides commercial real estate development services in the U.S., U.K., and Continental Europe, and Telford Homes Plc (Telford), a developer of residential multi-family properties in the U.K. Within Development Services, Trammell Crow Company pursues opportunistic, risk-mitigated development and investment strategies for users of and investors in commercial real estate, as well as for our own account. Our development business is active in industrial, office, residential multi-family/mixed-use projects, life sciences and healthcare facilities of all types (medical office buildings, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers) and retail properties. We are compensated by our clients on a fee basis with no, or limited, ownership interest in a property; in partnership with our clients through co-investment \u2013 either on an individual project basis or through programs with certain strategic capital partners or for our own account with 100% ownership. Development services activity in which Trammell Crow Company has an ownership interest is conducted through subsidiaries that are consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes, depending primarily on the extent and nature of our ownership interest. Our Telford Homes business within Development Services is focused on residential real estate development in the United Kingdom, including for-sale and build-to-rent properties.  At December\u00a031, 2022, we had $16.9\u00a0billion of development projects in process, and our development pipeline (prospective projects that we estimate have a greater than 50% chance of closing or where land has been acquired and the projected construction start date is more than one year out) totaled $12.9\u00a0billion at December\u00a031, 2022.  4 4 4  Table of Contents Table of Contents Corporate and Other Our Corporate function primarily consists of corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain other central functions. We track our strategic non-core non-controlling equity investments in \u201cother\u201d which is considered an operating segment and reported together with Corporate as it does not meet the aggregation criteria for presentation as a separate reportable segment. These activities are not allocated to the other business segments. Corporate and other also includes eliminations related to inter-segment revenue.  Competition We face competition across our lines of business on a global, multi-national, national, regional and local level. Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2022 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets, property types and services. We face competition from other global, national, regional and local commercial real estate service providers; companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded into other outsourcing offerings; in-house corporate real estate departments and property owners/developers that self-perform real estate services; investment banking firms, investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital; accounting/consulting firms that advise on real estate strategies; and providers of flexible office-space solutions that offer space directly to the occupier. Despite ongoing consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive. Although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than we are, some of them are larger on a regional or local-market basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering. Among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms, such as Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL), Cushman & Wakefield plc, Colliers International Group Inc., Savills plc, and Newmark Group Inc., market-segment specialists, such as Eastdil Secured, Marcus & Millichap, Inc. and Walker & Dunlop, Inc.; firms with business lines that compete with some business lines within our occupier outsourcing business, such as ISS and Sodexo S.A., firms engaged in project management such as Arcadis and AECOM, and firms that provide flexible office-space solutions, such as WeWork and IWG/Regus/Spaces. These flexible space providers also compete directly with Industrious National Management Company LLC (Industrious), in which we have a non-controlling interest.  Seasonality In a typical year, a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities have tended to be lowest in the first\u00a0quarter and highest in the fourth\u00a0quarter of each year. Revenue, earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth\u00a0calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end. The sharp rise in interest rates to combat inflation and resultant economic uncertainty may cause seasonality to deviate from historical patterns. 5 5 5  Table of Contents Table of Contents Human Capital  People & Culture People are at the center of our strategy to deliver measurably superior outcomes for clients, and therefore we place a high priority on attracting, retaining and developing the best talent. Our human capital programs are designed to help prepare our professionals to succeed in their current and future roles, develop our leaders of tomorrow, reward our people with competitive pay and benefits, foster an engaging and inclusive workplace, and improve productivity through investments in technology, tools and resources. At December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 115,000\u00a0employees (excluding Turner & Townsend employees) worldwide, approximately 46% of whose costs are fully reimbursed by clients and are mainly in our Global Workplace Solutions segment and our property management line of business within our Advisory Services segment. At December\u00a031, 2022, approximately 14% of our employees worldwide were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our global workforce at December\u00a031, 2022 is comprised of approximately 34.3%\u00a0female and 65.7%\u00a0male employees. RISE Values We champion four key values\u2014Respect, Integrity, Service, Excellence\u2014which serve as the foundation upon which our company is built and as a touchstone for how our employees conduct themselves.  Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) We believe that our company is at its best when people of different background and life experiences come together to produce great results for our clients, communities and each other. We are committed to increasing the diversity of our workforce, strengthening an inclusive culture where everyone is valued and supported in achieving their full potential, and investing in the communities where we live and work. These efforts are led by our Chief Responsibility Officer, a senior executive level position reporting directly to our Chief Executive Officer. We have many programs and initiatives focused on driving these outcomes. These include collaborating with partners to reach diverse talent underrepresented in our industry, enhancing data analysis, improving technological capabilities to better inform decisions, and building a diverse talent pool and interview process. We are committed to driving economic impact in the marketplace through our supplier diversity initiatives and spent more than $1.5\u00a0billion with diverse suppliers in 2022, with a goal to lift that annual spend to $3 billion by the end of 2025.  Also, as part of our Community Impact Initiative, we made significant financial contributions to nonprofit organizations that are helping to improve education and career development opportunities for women, racial/ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ individuals, and people with military service. These efforts will help to build the pipeline of talent well into the future and enable CBRE\u2019s workforce to reflect the diversity of our communities. Our employee business resource groups have more than 19,000 members globally and are an essential element of our DE&I activities. They facilitate career and professional development sessions, create networking opportunities, and organize conversations and events on DE&I issues. We publicly report demographics, including diversity data, for our U.S. workforce annually in our Corporate Responsibility Report.   Total Rewards We provide competitive total rewards programs in all the markets in which we operate, including fixed and variable pay, and comprehensive, company-specific benefits. Additionally, managers may implement flexible work arrangements, such as compressed work weeks and flextime, after considering several factors such as the nature of the employee\u2019s work. We remain committed to providing eligible employees with meaningful and affordable benefits. We provide a variety of programs to support holistic physical and behavioral health, short and long-term financial stability, family planning and emotional resiliency for employees at any stage in their career. Learning and Talent Development We prioritize and invest in a range of learning and talent development programs that enable employees to thrive at CBRE and develop their careers. To this end, we leverage a range of different learning approaches including: webinars, live virtual and in-person training, self-paced e-digital learning, coaching, mentoring and on-the-job learning. To increase diversity, equity and inclusion awareness, we offer training programs in 32 languages. 6 6 6  Table of Contents Table of Contents Communication and Engagement Our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to the company\u2019s overall strategy. We use a variety of channels to facilitate two-way communication, including open forums with executives, annual employee engagement surveys, regularly scheduled performance review processes and participation in employee business resource groups globally for professional development, networking and advancing diversity, equity and inclusion goals.   Workplace Safety and Wellbeing We drive a culture where safety and wellbeing are integrated into every business decision. We insist on high global standards and leadership accountability, striving to continually improve safety and wellbeing outcomes. Our wellbeing programs focus on five dimensions: occupational, social, environmental, physical, and intellectual. In 2022, we hosted our annual Global Safety and Wellbeing Week, themed \u201cSafe and Well Across Every Dimension.\u201d Our \u201cBe Well\u201d campaign supports employee wellbeing through benefits enhancements, information and resources, an internal podcast series and other engagement programs that received external recognition.  Communities and Giving We are committed to supporting and adding value to the communities where our employees live and work around the world, as well as in communities where the need is greatest. In 2022, we launched fundraising programs to support refugees from Ukraine, including affected employees of our Ukraine affiliate, and victims of hurricanes, fires and floods. We align our philanthropy with the company\u2019s overarching environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities and focus on three main areas: driving climate action solutions, building the workforce of tomorrow by expanding opportunities for underrepresented individuals in our industry and improving our global headquarters city of Dallas, Texas.  Intellectual Property We regard our intellectual property as an important part of our business. We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the \u201cCBRE,\u201d \u201cTurner & Townsend\u201d and \u201cTelford\u201d marks. Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by the expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the \u201cCBRE\u201d and \u201cTrammell Crow Company\u201d marks. We maintain trademark registrations for the \u201cCBRE,\u201d \u201cTurner & Townsend\u201d and \u201cTelford\u201d service marks in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business. We hold a license to use the \u201cTrammell Crow Company\u201d trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement. In addition to trademarks and trade names, we have acquired and developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services and analysis. We have a number of issued and pending patent applications relating to these proprietary technologies. We will continue to file additional patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate, demonstrating our commitment to technology and innovation. We also offer proprietary research to clients through our CBRE Research and CBRE Econometric Advisors commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups and we offer proprietary investment analysis and structures through our CBRE Investment Management business. 7 7 7  Table of Contents Table of Contents Material Governmental Matters Environment Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities, controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership, management, development, use or sale of commercial real estate. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property. If contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable for such costs as a current \u201coperator\u201d of a property, regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property. Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws, regulations and treaties governing climate change, particularly for \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions\u201d which seek to tax, penalize or limit their release. Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time. While we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned, operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location. However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry in general and us. Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses, which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines. Environmental Sustainability We have developed measurable environmental and sustainability goals for 2035, grounded in science and an assessment of where our operations have the most significant potential to impact on the environment, as well as the areas where we can most effectively mitigate that impact.  These include goals to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 68% from the 2019 base year.
