{"cik": 73309, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01. Business. Overview Nucor Corporation, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1958, and its affiliates (\u201cNucor,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) manufacture steel and steel products. The Company also produces direct reduced iron (\u201cDRI\u201d) for use in its steel mills. Through The David J. Joseph Company and its affiliates (\u201cDJJ\u201d), the Company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron, hot briquetted iron (\u201cHBI\u201d) and DRI. Most of the Company\u2019s operating facilities and customers are located in North America. The Company\u2019s operations include international trading and sales companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the Company and others. Nucor is North America\u2019s largest recycler, using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products. In 2022, we recycled approximately 17.8\u00a0million gross tons of scrap steel. Segments, Principal Products Produced, and Markets and Marketing Nucor reports its results in three segments: steel mills, steel products and raw materials. The steel mills segment is Nucor\u2019s largest segment, representing 58% of the Company\u2019s sales to external customers in the year ended December\u00a031, 2022.  We market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through in-house sales forces. We also utilize our internal distribution and trading companies to market our products abroad. The markets for these products are largely tied to nonresidential construction, durable goods and capital spending that are affected by changes in general economic conditions. We are a leading domestic provider for most of the products we supply, and, in many cases (e.g., structural steel, merchant bar steel, steel joist and deck, pre-engineered metal buildings, steel piling, cold finish bar steel, steel electrical conduit pipe and insulated metal panels), we are the leading supplier.  In recent years we have embarked on a strategy to advance Nucor\u2019s growth and further its value creation, as summarized in our Mission Statement: Grow the Core, Expand Beyond and Live Our Culture.  We have examined and prioritized high return on investment growth opportunities across our core steelmaking, steel products and raw materials operations, and we have identified and executed on several acquisitions and investments to expand the products and services we offer beyond our traditional capabilities. We believe that the Expand Beyond growth opportunities we are pursuing leverage our core competency as a highly efficient, industrial manufacturer working primarily with steel and steel products, while positioning us to generate attractive profit margins and returns on our invested capital selling products into growing end markets.  Our business strategy shapes \u201cwhat\u201d we do, while the Nucor Way shapes \u201chow\u201d we go about doing it. We believe adherence to the key tenets of our culture as reflected in the Nucor Way is a powerful differentiator for Nucor and positions the Company favorably to deliver ongoing stockholder value to our investors.  1  Steel mills segment  In the steel mills segment, Nucor produces sheet steel (hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized), plate steel, structural steel (wide-flange beams, beam blanks, H-piling and sheet piling) and bar steel (blooms, billets, concrete reinforcing bar, merchant bar and engineered special bar quality (\u201cSBQ\u201d)). Nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces (\u201cEAFs\u201d) along with continuous casting and automated rolling mills. The steel mills segment also includes Nucor\u2019s equity method investments in NuMit LLC (\u201cNuMit\u201d) and Nucor-JFE Steel Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (\u201cNJSM\u201d) (see \u201cSteel joint ventures\u201d- below), as well as international trading and distribution companies that buy and sell steel manufactured by the Company and other steel producers.  The steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers, fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The steel mills segment sold approximately 18,200,000 tons to outside customers in 2022. In 2022, 78% of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external customers. The remaining 22% of the steel mills segment\u2019s shipments went to our steel products segment.  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nBar mills - Nucor has 15 bar mills strategically located across the United States that manufacture a broad range of steel products, including concrete reinforcing bars, hot-rolled bars, rounds, light shapes, structural angles, channels, wire rod and highway products in carbon and alloy steels.

Four of the bar mills have a significant focus on manufacturing SBQ and wire rod products. Steel produced by our bar mills has a wide usage serving end markets, including the agricultural, automotive, construction, energy, furniture, machinery, metal building, railroad, recreational equipment, shipbuilding, heavy truck and trailer market segments. Considering Nucor\u2019s production capabilities and the mix of bar products generally produced and marketed, the capacity of the bar mills is estimated at approximately 9,560,000 tons per year. 2 Reinforcing and merchant bar steel are sold in standard sizes and grades, which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers\u2019 expected orders. Our SBQ products are hot-rolled to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive, energy, agricultural, heavy equipment and transportation sectors. In April 2022, Nucor announced that it will build its new rebar micro mill, with spooling capabilities, in Lexington, North Carolina. The new micro mill is currently under construction. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nSheet mills - Nucor operates six strategically located sheet mills that utilize thin slab casters to produce flat-rolled steel for automotive, appliance, construction, pipe and tube and many other industrial and consumer applications. Considering Nucor\u2019s production capabilities and the mix of flat-rolled products generally produced and marketed, the capacity of the sheet mills is estimated at approximately 13,800,000 tons per year. All of our sheet mills are equipped with galvanizing lines and four of them are equipped with cold rolling mills for further processing of hot-rolled sheet steel. \u00a0 \u2022 Sheet mills - Nucor operates six strategically located sheet mills that utilize thin slab casters to produce flat-rolled steel for automotive, appliance, construction, pipe and tube and many other industrial and consumer applications.

All of our sheet mills are equipped with galvanizing lines and four of them are equipped with cold rolling mills for further processing of hot-rolled sheet steel. Nucor produces hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized sheet steel to customers\u2019 specifications. Contract sales within the steel mills segment are most notable in our sheet operations, as it is common for contract sales to account for the majority of sheet sales in a given year. We estimate that greater than 85% of our sheet steel sales in 2022 were to contract customers. The balance of our sheet steel sales were made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale. The number of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including our consideration of current and future market conditions, our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons in a manner to meet our customers\u2019 requirements while considering the expected profitability, our desire to sustain a diversified customer base, and our end-use customers\u2019 perceptions about future market conditions. These sheet sales contracts are noncancellable agreements that generally incorporate monthly or quarterly price adjustments reflecting changes in the current market-based indices and/or raw material cost, and typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months.  In January 2022, Nucor announced it had selected Mason County, West Virginia as the site for its new 3-million-ton state-of-the-art sheet mill. When operational, the new mill will be equipped to produce 84-inch sheet products, and among other features, will include a 76-inch tandem cold mill and two galvanizing lines capable of producing advanced high-end automotive and construction grades. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nStructural mills - Nucor operates two structural mills that produce wide-flange steel beams, pilings and heavy structural steel products for fabricators, construction companies, manufacturers and steel service centers.

Nucor\u2019s raw materials investments are focused on creating an advantage for its steelmaking operations, through a global information network and a multi-pronged and flexible approach to raw materials supply. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nScrap recycling and brokerage operations - DJJ operates six regional scrap recycling companies across the United States that together have shredders capable of processing approximately 5,824,000 tons of ferrous scrap annually. DJJ\u2019s scrap recycling operations use industry-leading expertise and technology to maximize metal recovery and minimize waste. \u00a0 \u2022 Scrap recycling and brokerage operations - DJJ operates six regional scrap recycling companies across the United States that together have shredders capable of processing approximately 5,824,000 tons of ferrous scrap annually. DJJ\u2019s scrap recycling operations use industry-leading expertise and technology to maximize metal recovery and minimize waste. DJJ is the leading broker of ferrous scrap in North America and is a global trader of scrap metal, pig iron and other metallics. In addition to sourcing steel scrap for Nucor\u2019s mills, DJJ is a global trader of ferro-alloys and nonferrous metals. DJJ\u2019s logistics team owns and operates one of the largest independent fleets of railcars in the United States dedicated to the movement of scrap and steel and also offers railcar leasing and railcar fleet management services. These activities have strategic value to Nucor as the leading and most diversified North American steel producer. Our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are EAF steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process. External customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers, secondary aluminum smelters, steel mills, and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals. We market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through in-house sales forces. In 2022, approximately 8% of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitute tons we brokered and processed were sold to external customers. We consumed the balance in our steel mills. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nDirect reduced iron operations - DRI is a substitute material for high-quality grades of scrap and pig iron. Nucor operates two DRI plants with a combined annual capacity of approximately 4,500,000\u00a0metric tons of material with world-class metallization rates and carbon content. Nucor\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Nu-Iron Unlimited, is located in Trinidad and benefits from a low-cost supply of natural gas and favorable logistics for inbound iron ore and shipment of DRI to the United States. Nucor\u2019s second DRI plant in Louisiana also benefits from favorable logistics and proximity to its steel mill customers. \u00a0 \u2022 Direct reduced iron operations - DRI is a substitute material for high-quality grades of scrap and pig iron.

Nucor\u2019s DRI production and brokering capabilities provide our steel mills flexibility to quickly adjust their metallic input mix to changing market conditions, enabling them to maintain cost competitiveness in the often-volatile ferrous scrap market. With the potential for high-quality scrap to become scarcer, coupled with the risk of third-party supplier disruptions, Nucor\u2019s DRI facilities provide a greater degree of certainty over metallics supply to its steel mills. 7 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nNatural gas production programs - Nucor owns operating wells and leasehold interests in natural gas properties in the Piceance Basin in the Western Slope of Colorado.  \u00a0 \u2022 Natural gas production programs - Nucor owns operating wells and leasehold interests in natural gas properties in the Piceance Basin in the Western Slope of Colorado.  Nucor\u2019s access to a long-term, low-cost supply of natural gas is a component in the execution of Nucor\u2019s raw material strategy. Natural gas produced by Nucor\u2019s production operations is being sold to third parties to partially offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our DRI plant in Louisiana and our steel mills in the United States. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nUniversal Industrial Gases (\u201cUIG\u201d) \u2013 Nucor acquired UIG in 2019 so that we would have the capability to build and operate our own air separation units (\u201cASU\u201d) to serve our steel mills, providing us with an alternative to long term service contracts with outside providers. Where economies of scale and regional market conditions warrant, we can also sell excess output from these plants on a merchant basis. As of December 31, 2022, Nucor had five industrial gas plants operating, and five others at various stages of commissioning, construction, or planning.  \u00a0 \u2022 Universal Industrial Gases (\u201cUIG\u201d) \u2013 Nucor acquired UIG in 2019 so that we would have the capability to build and operate our own air separation units (\u201cASU\u201d) to serve our steel mills, providing us with an alternative to long term service contracts with outside providers.

Customers and Markets We have a diverse customer base and are not dependent on any single customer. Our largest single customer in 2022 represented approximately 5% of sales and consistently pays within terms. Our steel mills use a significant portion of the products of the raw materials segment.   We believe that nonresidential construction is the largest end-use market that we serve. Products from our steel mills and steel products segments are used in a variety of nonresidential construction applications (e.g., commercial, industrial and infrastructure). In recent years we have come to see our EAF-based steelmaking method, with its lower GHG intensity when compared with blast furnace technology reliant on mined or extracted virgin iron ore and coking coal, as a competitive advantage for reasons beyond its flexible, highly variable cost base. Customers are expressing greater concern for the GHG emissions in their supply chains and are prioritizing sourcing their steel requirements from EAF-based steelmakers for incorporation into their projects and products.\u00a0\u00a0 We have developed branded product lines to leverage this, and other advantages conferred by our specialized capabilities:\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nOur AEOSTM line of high-strength, low-alloy steel beams is one such example. AEOSTM\u2019s benefits are increasingly recognized by Nucor\u2019s customers in the construction sector.\u00a0\u00a0These include savings in terms of construction time, weight, space and overall environmental impact.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Our AEOSTM line of high-strength, low-alloy steel beams is one such example.

We launched ElcyonTM in January 2023 and will manufacture this product at our new plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky.  \u00a0 \u2022 Our ElcyonTM line of sustainable heavy gauge steel plate product will be made specifically for America\u2019s offshore wind energy producers. We launched ElcyonTM in January 2023 and will manufacture this product at our new plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky.  We have also invested in people and processes to organize more of our commercial activities around large customers and end-use markets (e.g., automotive, construction, wind energy and solar energy). We have developed dedicated teams who are tasked with developing relationships and educating decision makers in these sectors. We believe this could result in earlier and more thoughtful consideration being given to steel-based solutions from Nucor, and a better appreciation for some of our unique products and capabilities, such as AEOSTM , ECONIQTM and ElcyonTM. General Development of Our Business in Recent Years Consistent with our strategy to Grow the Core, Expand Beyond and Live our Culture, Nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to expand our product portfolio to include more value-added steel mill products and capabilities, improve our cost structure, enhance our operational flexibility and  8 increase our exposure to markets with attractive growth prospects, such as datacenters, warehouses and renewable energy. These investments totaled approximately $10.25\u00a0billion over the last three years, with approximately 50% going to capital expenditures and the remainder going to acquisitions. We believe that these investments will help us deliver higher returns on invested capital and long-term growth. Further, we believe shifting our product mix to a greater proportion of value-added products will make our overall business less volatile.  In our steel mills segment, Nucor has initiated several new capital projects and an acquisition of a majority ownership position of a steel mill to support our expansion of value-added product offerings and cost-reduction strategies.  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nNucor has completed construction of a new $352 million third generation flexible galvanizing line with an annual capacity of approximately 500,000 tons at our Nucor Steel Arkansas facility. We believe this project, combined with Nucor Steel Arkansas\u2019 specialty cold mill that has been in operation for more than three years, position Nucor among North American EAF steelmakers to provide the high-strength, light-weight steels that are increasingly in demand from the automotive and other sectors. \u00a0 \u2022 Nucor has completed construction of a new $352 million third generation flexible galvanizing line with an annual capacity of approximately 500,000 tons at our Nucor Steel Arkansas facility.

The project will increase the production capability of the mill from approximately 1,600,000 tons to approximately 3,000,000 tons annually once fully online, which we expect will be in the second quarter of 2023. This enables the Gallatin mill to cast new, thicker slabs and wider coils, expanding our product capabilities into other markets. \u00a0 \u2022 Nucor has completed construction of its approximately $650\u00a0million investment to modernize and expand the production capability at its Gallatin flat-rolled sheet mill located in Ghent, Kentucky.

The new plate mill rolled its first plate in December 2022 and we expect to complete final commissioning and begin shipping tons to customers in the first quarter of 2023. We expect the mill to be capable of producing approximately 1,200,000 tons per year of steel plate products. With the capability to manufacture nearly all the different types of plate products consumed in the United States, we believe this mill will position Nucor as the supplier of choice in the domestic plate market. We expect domestic demand for steel plate to grow in the coming years as offshore wind farms are permitted and developed with increasing frequency. Steel plate is essential to constructing offshore wind towers, as is steel rebar. \u00a0 \u2022 Nucor has completed construction on our approximately $1.70 billion state-of-the-art plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky on the Ohio river.

As of February 2023, Nucor had determined that constructing the mill would require a net cash outlay of approximately $3.1 billion for the West Virginia sheet mill, an increase from its original estimate of $2.7 billion when the project was first announced. The revised $3.1 billion estimate is net of $275 million in cash proceeds received from the State of West Virginia for costs related to the site location. Factors contributing to the increased capital cost include general inflation, the acquisition of additional property and equipment, and expanded port and rail infrastructure requirements. As of February 2023, Nucor had received all required state permits and was working to secure federal permits. Construction of the new sheet mill is expected to take two to three years following receipt of all necessary permits. \u00a0 \u2022 In January 2022, Nucor announced that its new state-of-the-art sheet mill will be located in Mason County, West Virginia.

The new mill will be equipped to produce 84-inch sheet products, and among other features, will include a 76-inch tandem cold mill and two galvanizing lines. Galvanizing capabilities will include an advanced high-end automotive line with full inspection capabilities as well as a construction-grade line. In addition to its advanced capabilities and strategic location, the new greenfield mill\u2019s product mix is anticipated to have a significantly lower GHG intensity than competitors who have historically supplied the region. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 9 \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nIn February 2022, Nucor completed\u00a0its acquisition of a majority ownership position in\u00a0California Steel Industries, Inc. (\u201cCSI\u201d) by purchasing a 50% equity ownership interest from a subsidiary of Vale S.A.

This will be Nucor's third rebar micro mill, joining its existing micro mills in Missouri and Florida. We expect this $350 million investment to have an annual capacity of approximately 430,000 tons and we expect it to be in operation in 2024.  \u00a0 \u2022 In April 2022, Nucor announced that it will build its new rebar micro mill, with spooling capabilities, in Lexington, North Carolina.

We expect this $350 million investment to have an annual capacity of approximately 430,000 tons and we expect it to be in operation in 2024.  \u00a0 These mills are referred to as micro mills because they have a smaller operational footprint than our older rebar mills, as well as less productive capacity \u2013 typically about 400,000 tons per year.\u00a0\u00a0This makes them suitable for regional markets and enables us to serve these markets with a logistics cost advantage relative to competitors operating from further away.\u00a0\u00a0Micro mills also have a lower environmental footprint due to their smaller size and the fact that their plant design does not typically include a natural gas fired reheat furnace that is common in many steel mills. \u00a0 Nucor has made strategic acquisitions in the steel products segment over the last two years. These were largely to further the Expand Beyond component of our strategy.  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nIn August 2021, Nucor acquired the assets of the IMP business of Cornerstone for a cash purchase price of approximately $1.00 billion. The acquired IMP business is comprised of two industry leading brands, CENTRIA and Metl-Span. The brands are now part of the Nucor Insulated Panel group, which also includes the Company's initial IMP business, TrueCore.We believe this acquisition will broaden the value-added solutions that the Nucor Buildings group provides to targeted end markets such as warehousing, distribution and data centers. We expect these end-use markets to continue to grow in the coming years and that the use of IMP products within them will also increase. IMPs facilitate cost-effective climate control in the built environment and reduce energy usage and overall operations-related GHG emissions for owners and lessees.  \u00a0 \u2022 In August 2021, Nucor acquired the assets of the IMP business of Cornerstone for a cash purchase price of approximately $1.00 billion.

Hannibal is a leading national provider of racking solutions to warehouses and serves the e-commerce, industrial, food storage and retail segments. Hannibal has manufacturing facilities in Los Angeles and Houston, as well as three distribution centers. It utilizes sheet and bar steel, as well as steel decking, wire deck and fasteners to produce its racking solutions, providing potential supply chain efficiencies with other Nucor businesses. In addition to manufacturing racking solutions, Hannibal works closely with customers during the construction and design phases of a warehouse build-out by offering turn-key services such as installation, procurement and facility integration. Hannibal also provides retrofit services to support customers\u2019 efforts to modernize and/or repurpose existing facilities. \u00a0 \u2022 In August 2021, Nucor acquired Hannibal for $370 million.

CHI is a leading manufacturer of overhead doors for residential and commercial markets in the United States and Canada. Commercial overhead doors are used in warehousing and retail, areas that Nucor has focused its attention on recently through other value-added products such as insulated metal panels and steel racking solutions. It is expected that the CHI acquisition also will benefit from supply chain efficiencies due to Nucor\u2019s recent paint line investments at its Hickman, Arkansas and Crawfordsville, Indiana sheet mills. \u00a0 \u2022 In June 2022, Nucor completed the largest acquisition in its history with the purchase of CHI for approximately $3 billion.

With a highly diversified national customer network of professional garage door dealers, CHI is able to maintain minimal inventory levels and realize industry-leading fulfillment times, while providing direct delivery to customers. Capital Allocation Strategy Our highest capital allocation priority is to invest in our business for profitable long-term growth through our multi-pronged strategy of optimizing existing operations, greenfield expansions and acquisitions. Our second priority is to return capital to our stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. Nucor has paid $1.51\u00a0billion in dividends to its stockholders during the past three years. That dividend payout represents 8% of cash flows from operations during that three-year period. The Company repurchased $2.76 billion\u00a0of its common stock in 2022 ($3.28\u00a0billion in 2021 and $39.5\u00a0million in 2020).  We intend to return at least 40% of our net income to stockholders over time via a combination of both cash dividends and share repurchases. Over the past three years, we have returned approximately 50% of our net income in this manner. At December\u00a031, 2022, the Company had approximately $1.09\u00a0billion available for share repurchases under the currently authorized share repurchase program. We intend to execute on our capital allocation strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet, with relatively low financial leverage, as measured in terms of debt to total capital, as well as ample liquidity. At year-end 2022, our debt to total capital was approximately 25% and we had cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and cash equivalents on hand of $4.94 billion. At the end of 2022, Nucor had the strongest credit ratings in the North American steel sector (Baa1/A-) with stable outlooks at both Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s. In January 2023, Fitch Ratings initiated coverage of Nucor and established new long-term and short-term credit ratings of A- and F1, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0 Competition We compete in a variety of steel and metal markets, including markets for finished steel products, unfinished steel products and raw materials. These markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating, and, as a result of this highly competitive environment, we find that we primarily compete on price and service. In our steel mills segment, our EAF steel mills face many different forms of competition, including domestic integrated steel producers (who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel), other domestic EAF steel mills, steel imports and alternative materials. Large domestic integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs. EAF-based steel producers, such as Nucor, are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with large integrated steel producers. EAF-based steel producers also typically emit fewer GHGs per ton of steel produced than integrated steel producers. 11 Global steel production overcapacity continues to be an ongoing risk to Nucor and the entire steel industry. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) estimates that global steel production overcapacity is currently more than 500,000,000 tons, with additional global capacity coming online and economic uncertainty impacting steel demand. An OECD report states that in Asia and Latin America 75 percent of the new capacity coming online between 2023 and 2025 will be blast furnace steel mills. Other regions of the world are not expected to see new blast furnace projects in those years.  China continues to be the largest steel producing country. In 2022, despite Covid-19 lockdowns and the slowest economic growth in half a century, China still produced 1.11 billion tons of steel, down slightly from its all-time record.  Circumvention of trade duties also continues to pose a risk. Besides producing over a billion tons of steel in its own country, China is investing heavily in steel production in other countries which is one way it tries to avoid being subject to trade duties. According to OECD, state-owned Chinese steel companies are involved in 13 cross-border steel investments and are part of nine joint venture investments outside of the country. Most of these projects are in Asia and Africa.  The Section 232 steel tariffs and successful trade cases have been effective in keeping unfairly traded imports out of the U.S. market. The U.S. government has reached agreements with several allied countries to replace the Section 232 tariffs on steel with a quota system. The U.S. and European Union are also negotiating the world\u2019s first carbon-based sectoral arrangement that will restrict access to their markets for higher-emitting steel imports and countries that dump cheap imports. Other countries will be able to join if they meet criteria for restoring market orientation and reducing trade in high-carbon steel and aluminum products. During the year, sunset review hearings kept in place antidumping (AD) and countervailing duties (CVD) orders on corrosion-resistant, cold-rolled and hot-rolled steel products from several countries. These trade remedy orders play a key role in allowing the American steel industry to compete on a level playing field against unfairly traded imports, and the sunset reviews have left the orders almost entirely in place.\u00a0\u00a0 In December of 2022, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that the Section 232 tariffs violated U.S. WTO commitments. The U.S. government strongly disagrees with the ruling and is appealing. Imports of finished steel in 2022 were up approximately 11% from 2021 levels and accounted for approximately 24% of U.S. market share.  We also experience competition from other materials. Depending on our customers\u2019 end use of our products, there are often other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, plastics, composites and wood that compete with our steel products. When the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises, these alternatives can become more attractive to our customers. Competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous. The scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented. Firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal. Backlog In the steel mills segment, Nucor\u2019s backlog of orders was approximately $2.33 billion and $3.79\u00a0billion at December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from other Nucor businesses. Nucor\u2019s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately $6.65\u00a0billion and $8.12\u00a0billion at December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of these orders are expected to be filled within one year. Order backlog within our raw materials segment is not meaningful because the vast majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally. 12 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials An ample supply of high-quality scrap and scrap substitutes is critical to support Nucor\u2019s ability to produce high-quality steel. Nucor\u2019s raw materials segment safely produces, sources, trades and transports steelmaking raw materials. Nucor\u2019s raw materials investments are focused on creating an advantage for our steelmaking operations, through a global information network and flexible approach to metallics supply. Scrap and scrap substitutes are the most significant element in the total cost of steel production. The average cost of scrap and scrap substitutes used in our steel mills segment increased 5% from $469 per gross ton used in 2021 to $492 per gross ton used in 2022. On average, it takes approximately 1.1 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce one ton of steel. Depending on the market conditions at the time, variable steel pricing mechanisms may be implemented to assist Nucor in maintaining operating margins and in meeting our customer commitments during periods of rapidly changing scrap and scrap substitute costs.  For more than a decade, Nucor has focused on securing access to low-cost raw material inputs as they are the Company\u2019s largest expense. We believe Nucor\u2019s broad, balanced supply chain is an important strength which allows us to reduce the cost of our steelmaking operations, create a shorter supply chain and have greater optionality over our metallic inputs. Our investment in DRI production facilities and scrap yards, as well as our access to international raw materials markets, provides Nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw material costs. Additionally, having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials, particularly since a good deal of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil, such as Ukraine, Russia and Brazil. We believe the continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy, including key investments in DRI production, as well as in the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at DJJ, gives us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus helps us mitigate the risk of significant fluctuations in the availability and costs of critical inputs. DJJ acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources, including manufacturers of products made from steel, industrial plants, scrap dealers, peddlers, auto wreckers and demolition firms. In recent years, we have developed closed loop recycling programs with some of our larger manufacturing customers, through which we are able to reliably source more high purity prime scrap while reducing the waste inherent in our customers\u2019 operations. During 2022, we sourced approximately 0.8 million tons of prime scrap from these programs. We purchase pig iron as needed primarily from overseas sources. We received over 1,500,000 gross tons of pig iron in 2022. Our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana have respective annual production capacities of approximately 2,000,000 and 2,500,000 metric tons. The primary raw material for our DRI facilities is pelletized iron ore, which we purchase from various international suppliers.  The primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by Nucor\u2019s steel mills.Energy Consumption and Costs Steel manufacturing is considered an energy-intensive, trade exposed industry. As a result, we continuously strive to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient. In addition, we proactively engage with suppliers, regulators and other energy industry participants to ensure the continued domestic availability of reliable, low-cost sources of energy in various forms. Our steelmaking operations utilize EAFs for 100% of their production. The total energy consumed by Nucor includes electricity, natural gas, oxygen and carbon raw material inputs. For the scrap melting process, electricity is the primary energy source, with natural gas combustion serving as the fuel for reheat furnaces and other pre-heating operations. Our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana are also large consumers of natural gas.  13 The availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, the regulatory environment and pipeline/transmission infrastructure. We use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas, including cash flow hedges, as well as our owned natural gas drilling operations. In addition to the currently producing wells in the Piceance Basin, Nucor owns leasehold interests in natural gas properties in the South Piceance Basin, in the Western Slope of Colorado. To support Nucor\u2019s operating wells and potential future well developments on these properties, Nucor has entered into long-term agreements directly with third-party gathering and processing service providers. Natural gas produced by Nucor\u2019s drilling operations is being sold to partially offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our DRI plant in Louisiana, and by our steel mills in the United States. Nucor has full discretion on its participation in all future drilling capital investments, however, in the fourth quarter of 2022 we decided that it is unlikely that we will develop the remaining portions of our unproved oil and natural gas properties. We closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption. We engage with policymakers to provide technical information that can inform policy decisions and avoid unintended adverse consequences of legislative and regulatory actions. We believe that a thoughtful approach to domestic energy policy can help ensure that steel and steel products manufactured in the United States remain competitive in the increasingly global marketplace.  Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions GHG emissions by the energy sector have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years, as more people become concerned that these emissions may be a significant contributor to climate change. This has led to increasing support for, and investment in, low or zero carbon energy generation technologies such as solar, wind and nuclear. As a result, the development of these technologies has accelerated, and in many cases, they are now cost competitive with traditional, fossil fuel-based power generation. We believe that this ongoing diversification of power generation technologies is fundamentally positive, but without careful planning and investment there is some risk to the reliability of the domestic power grid as this transition continues. In particular, legacy fossil fuel-based assets will remain essential for some time to come and the U.S. transmission grid is broadly in need of substantial upgrades to take full advantage of these newer, more intermittent power sources.  In July 2021, we announced a commitment to lower the GHG emissions intensity from our steel mill operations by 35% in 2030, measured against a 2015 baseline - the year the Paris Climate Agreement was adopted.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, Nucor\u2019s GHG intensity in 2030 is expected to be 77% less than the global average when the target was set.\u00a0\u00a0We expect to achieve these goals with a multi-pronged approach that includes utilization of renewable energy, carbon substitutes, more efficient operations and carbon sequestration. \u00a0\u00a0In 2020 and 2021, we entered into three Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (\u201cVPPAs\u201d). Under each VPPA, we agreed to purchase for a fixed price a portion of the output of both solar and wind renewable power projects being developed in the United States. The VPPAs will be settled financially on a monthly basis. We have undertaken these initiatives to support the ongoing transition of the U.S. power grid to a greater reliance on renewable power. As part of these arrangements, we will also receive Renewable Energy Credits (\u201cRECs\u201d) commensurate with the power we purchase. These RECs can be applied against a portion of our GHG emissions, enabling us to receive credit for reducing them. The pay fixed, received floating nature of this arrangement also offsets a portion of our exposure to higher prices for electricity over the life of the contract. One VPPA started delivering RECs to us in June 2021, one project was terminated and the other VPPA has been delayed as a result of supply chain disruptions, permitting delays and interconnection uncertainty.\u00a0\u00a0We continue to evaluate and consider similar additional transactions. 14 Government and Environmental Regulations Our business operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, the most significant of which are intended to protect our teammates and the environment.\u00a0\u00a0Due to the nature of the steel industry, we are subject to substantial regulations related to safety in the workplace.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the requirements of the state and local governments of the communities in which we operate, we must comply with federal health and safety regulations, the most significant of which are enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d). Because safety and safety compliance is one of our primary values, its effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position is not estimable. Nucor operates a robust and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of each individual teammate, as well as management, being responsible for environmental performance. All steel mills that have been owned and operated by Nucor for over five years are ISO 14001 certified. Achieving ISO 14001 certification requires Nucor\u2019s steel mills to implement an environmental management system with measurable targets and objectives, such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use.  The principal federal environmental laws that regulate our business include the Clean Air Act (the \u201cCAA\u201d), which regulates air emissions; the Clean Water Act (the \u201cCWA\u201d), which regulates water withdrawals and discharges; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the \u201cRCRA\u201d), which addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the \u201cCERCLA\u201d), which governs releases of hazardous substances, and remediation of contaminated sites. Our operations are also subject to state and local environmental laws and regulations.  As it relates to air emission rates, EAFs are the most efficient and cleanest steel making process commercially available today. In comparison to blast furnaces, EAF emissions of sulfur oxides, particulate matter and GHGs per ton of steel are significantly less than integrated steelmaking operations utilizing blast furnaces. Operating EAFs instead of blast furnaces is a proven air quality improvement strategy.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, each of our steel mills operates air pollution control devices (baghouses) to collect and capture particulate emissions (\u201cEAF dust\u201d) from the steelmaking process.\u00a0\u00a0We strive to maintain compliance with all applicable CAA requirements. The primary raw material of Nucor\u2019s steelmaking operations is scrap metal. The process of recycling scrap metal generates particulate matter emissions that includes contaminants such as paint, zinc, lead, chrome and other metals. Initially, the particulate matter captured and collected is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the RCRA. Because these contaminants contain valuable metals, the EAF dust is recycled to recover these metals. Nucor sends all but a small fraction of the EAF dust it collects to recycling facilities that recover the zinc, lead, chrome and other valuable metals from this dust. By recycling this material, Nucor believes it is not only acting in a sustainable, responsible manner but it is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both the CERCLA and the RCRA. In addition to recycling EAF dust, Nucor mills beneficially reuse steel slag in road materials as a granular base, embankments, engineered fill, highway shoulders, and hot mix asphalt pavement. The physical, chemical, mechanical and thermal properties of steel slag provide a vital resource for construction companies and activities. We take considerable pride in our recycling efforts.  Not only does the RCRA establish standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes, the RCRA also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling and storage of most wastes. Periodically, past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are discovered.\u00a0\u00a0When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency determines these off-site properties are contaminated, Nucor quickly evaluates such claims and, if Nucor is determined to be responsible, we do our part to remediate our share of such issues. Nucor believes all identified liabilities under the RCRA are either currently being resolved or have been fully resolved.  15 Because Nucor has historically implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials, Nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under the CERCLA for which Nucor has been named a potentially responsible party. Nucor regularly evaluates these types of potential liabilities and, if appropriate, maintains reserves appropriate to remediate the identified liabilities. Under the RCRA, private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs. Nucor believes that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence provides reasonable assurance as to these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them. To protect water resources, the CWA regulates water withdrawals and discharges. When applicable, Nucor maintains water withdrawal and discharge permits at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the CWA and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits. Nucor also maintains permits from local governments if the facility discharges into publicly owned treatment works. Capital expenditures at our existing facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2022 and 2023 are estimated to be less than $100 million per year. Human Capital Resources Culture, Organization and Compensation We consider our teammates the most important part of Nucor and believe that our culture\u2014and the encouragement that we provide to our teammates to \u201cgrow the core; expand beyond; and live our culture\u201d \u2014provides us with a competitive advantage. Our culture\u2019s key principles are: Safety First, Trust, Open Communications, Teamwork, Community Stewardship and Results.\u00a0\u00a0 Nucor has a simple, streamlined organizational structure that allows our teammates to make quick decisions and innovate. Our organization is also highly decentralized, with most day-to-day operating decisions made by our division general managers and their teams. With more than 31,000 teammates, fewer than 200 work in our principal executive offices in Charlotte, North Carolina. By empowering our teammates, our goal is to foster an entrepreneurial mindset, along with a strong sense of personal responsibility and a culture of accountability. This empowerment is reinforced by our compensation policies (see discussion on \u201cPay for Performance\u201d in Our Teammates, Compensation, Training & Development section below) to drive results and contribute to our success.  Teammate input is essential for us to maintain our culture of empowering teammates to make operational decisions. Aside from our practice of everyday open communication, we periodically ask our teammates to formally provide feedback. Since 1986, we have asked our teammates to complete a comprehensive survey in order to gather feedback on a range of topics, including matters relating to the effectiveness of our culture. We view the survey as an important tool in continually improving our company and ensuring our teammates remain engaged and satisfied. This survey is conducted every three years, the last of which was conducted in 2022. In the most recent survey, 89% of the responses were favorable in the category of \u201cSatisfaction & Commitment.\u201d The overall percentage of negative responses in the most recent survey has dropped by 25 percentage points since the survey began in 1986. The next survey will be conducted in the summer of 2025. Teammates of certain previously acquired businesses \u2013 most notably Harris, which accounted for approximately 15% of our workforce as of December 31, 2022 \u2013 complete a comparable survey that has also shown an improving trend over time.  16 Safety, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion One of Nucor\u2019s core values is our teammates\u2019 well-being and safety, and it is our goal to become the safest steel company in the world. Our foremost responsibility is to work safely, which requires our teammates to identify unsafe conditions and activities and mitigate these hazards. We will continue working to eliminate exposures that can lead to injury and encourage our teammates to share their ideas for safety improvement. Two key metrics Nucor uses to measure safety are: the Injury/Illness Rate and Days Away, Restricted and Transfer (\u201cDART\u201d) Case Rate.\u00a0\u00a0 Nucor calculates the annual Injury/Illness Rate by dividing the number of work-related injuries and illnesses by the total number of hours worked by all Nucor teammates in a given year, and then multiplying the resulting percentage by 200,000, the equivalent of 100 full-time employees working 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year.\u00a0\u00a0In 2022, we achieved an annual Injury/Illness Rate of 0.95, which marks the safest year in the Company\u2019s history. This marks an improvement over our annual Injury/Illness Rate of 1.04 in 2021, which was the Company\u2019s previous record. Nucor uses the DART Case Rate to assess and manage the risk of serious injury in the workplace.\u00a0\u00a0Nucor calculates the annual DART Case Rate by dividing the number of cases resulting in days away from work, restricted work activity and/or job transfers by the total number of hours worked by all Nucor teammates in a given year, and then multiplying the resulting percentage by 200,000, the equivalent of 100 full-time employees working 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year.\u00a0\u00a0In 2022, we achieved an annual DART Case Rate of 0.43 (0.50 in 2021). Since 1998, Nucor has used the President\u2019s Safety Award to recognize divisions that achieve strong records of safety performance based on objective metrics. The President\u2019s Safety Award has the following three levels: Platinum, which is awarded to divisions with zero recordable illnesses or injuries; Gold, which is awarded to divisions that have an Illness/Injury Rate below 0.6 and a DART Case Rate below one-third of the national average for their NAICS code; and Silver, which is awarded to divisions that achieve one-third the national average on Illness/Injury Rate and DART Case Rate. In 2022, 20 divisions achieved the Platinum level award, 17 divisions achieved the Gold level award and 21 divisions achieved the Silver level award. Nucor also has 24 OSHA Voluntary Protection Program Sites, OSHA\u2019s highest level of recognition. In 2020, the Company introduced the Nucor President\u2019s Safety Cup as a way to foster more safety benchmarking throughout the Company. The President\u2019s Safety Cup is an additional annual award that is presented to the region that has the best safety record across all of Nucor. Not only does this reward a facility for exceeding their individual safety goals, but it encourages our teams to work with their regional teammates to share ideas and improve safety as a group. The President\u2019s Safety Cup trophy travels among the mills and divisions that make up the winning region.  We believe, however, that Safety is about more than just avoiding injuries. At Nucor, safety means making sure our teammates feel safe, welcome and valued when they come to work each day. We are accelerating our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts with the objective of ensuring that each teammate feels a sense of belonging at Nucor. By creating an inclusive workplace, we believe we will attract top talent and achieve greater diversity in our workforce and leadership, which will make Nucor a stronger company. Over the past two years, approximately 35% of Nucor teammates hired or promoted to the Manager or General Manager level were diverse.  Some of the initiatives focused on inclusion, equity and diversity we have launched include: \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nConducting focused discussion groups to share experiences of the workplace and the effects of race and gender; \u00a0 \u2022 Conducting focused discussion groups to share experiences of the workplace and the effects of race and gender; \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nTaking feedback onboard to enhance training and development; \u00a0 \u2022 Taking feedback onboard to enhance training and development; \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nWebcasts by diverse senior leaders sharing their career progression and life experiences \u00a0 \u2022 Webcasts by diverse senior leaders sharing their career progression and life experiences 17 \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nIncreasing focus and intensity of engagement with supportive external partners, such as: \u00a0 \u2022 Increasing focus and intensity of engagement with supportive external partners, such as: \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nNational Society of Black Engineers; \u00a0 \u2022 National Society of Black Engineers; \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nSociety of Women Engineers; \u00a0 \u2022 Society of Women Engineers; \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nNational Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers; \u00a0 \u2022 National Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers; \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nINROADS (non-profit focused on addressing the lack of diversity in corporate America) \u00a0 \u2022 INROADS (non-profit focused on addressing the lack of diversity in corporate America) \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nTuskegee University; and \u00a0 \u2022 Tuskegee University; and \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nPurdue University\u2019s Women in Engineering Program and Minorities in Engineering Program. \u00a0 \u2022 Purdue University\u2019s Women in Engineering Program and Minorities in Engineering Program. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\n\nMore proactive senior executive support for career development opportunities for diverse employees. \u00a0 \u2022 More proactive senior executive support for career development opportunities for diverse employees. Our Teammates - Compensation, Training & Development Nucor had approximately 31,400 teammates as of December 31, 2022.\u00a0\u00a0The vast majority of our teammates are located in the United States, with only a small number of teammates located outside of North America. Our operations are highly automated, allowing us to take advantage of lower employment costs while still providing our teammates with compensation that we believe is highly competitive as compared to businesses in our industry. At Nucor, we believe in \u201cPay-for-Performance.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Nucor teammates typically earn a significant part of their compensation based on their productivity. Production teammates work under group incentives that provide increased earnings for increased production. This additional incentive compensation is paid weekly in most cases. Nucor has also historically contributed 10% of earnings before federal taxes to a profit sharing plan for the majority of teammates below the officer level. We believe such compensation practices incentivize our workforce and reinforce our culture. For 2022, this profit sharing contribution, was the largest in our history and amounted to approximately $862 million. We expect that the profit sharing contribution in 2023 will be the largest in our history, and expect to contribute approximately $959 million in March 2023. While Nucor seeks to hire qualified and talented individuals as teammates, we also believe in developing the skills of our workforce by providing educational and on-the-job training, in addition to safety training. Further, Nucor believes it is important for senior management to also be familiar with, and have had direct experience running, Nucor\u2019s mills and other operational divisions. The vast majority of our teammates are not represented by labor unions and we believe our teammate turnover is low. At Nucor, we believe that a diversity of perspectives and background helps to facilitate the \u201cNucor Way\u201d as we work to \u201cgrow the core; expand beyond; and live our culture.\u201d We also believe that recruiting and hiring the best talent available will continue to provide us with a more diverse and capable workforce.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policies Nucor has a long history of conducting our businesses in a manner consistent with high standards of social responsibility.\u00a0\u00a0We have adopted a comprehensive Human Rights Policy, which operates in conjunction with many other Nucor policies related to ethical conduct and human rights, including our Standards of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Professionals, Supplier Code of Conduct and Policy on Eliminating Forced Labor from our Supply Chain.
