{"cik": 1037540, "item_1A": "Item 1.  Business   General BXP, a Delaware corporation, is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT, and is one of the largest publicly-traded office REITs (based on total market capitalization as of December\u00a031, 2022) in the United States that develops, owns and manages primarily premier workplaces.  BXP was formed in 1997 to succeed the real estate development, redevelopment, acquisition, management, operating and leasing businesses associated with the predecessor company founded by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde in 1970. Our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets\u2014Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.  At December\u00a031, 2022, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 194 commercial real estate properties, aggregating approximately 54.1 million net rentable square feet of primarily premier workplaces, including 13 properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 3.2 million net rentable square feet.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, our properties consisted of:\u00a0 \u2022173 office and life sciences properties (including 10 properties under construction/redevelopment); \u202214 retail properties (including two properties under construction/redevelopment); \u2022six residential properties (including one property under construction); and \u2022one hotel. We consider premier workplaces to be well-located buildings that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings and are professionally managed and maintained.  As such, these properties attract creditworthy clients and command upper-tier rental rates.  Our definition of premier workplaces may be different than those used by other companies. We are a full-service real estate company, with substantial in-house expertise and resources in acquisitions, development, financing, capital markets, construction management, property management, marketing, leasing, accounting, risk management, tax and legal services.  For this reason, we refer to our tenants as \u201cclients\u201d due to the many facets of our continuous engagements with them, which span beyond the usual tenant/landlord relationship.  Throughout this Annual Report, we use the terms \u201ctenant\u201d and \u201cclient\u201d interchangeably. BXP manages BPLP as its sole general partner.

Boston Properties Limited Partnership BPLP is a Delaware limited partnership organized in 1997, and the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets.  BXP is the sole general partner of BPLP and, as of February\u00a021, 2023, the owner of approximately 89.4% of the economic interests in BPLP.  Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP owned by BXP as a percentage of the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP and (2) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term incentive plan units of BPLP (\u201cLTIP Units\u201d), for which all performance conditions have been satisfied for such conversion.  We exclude from (1) and (2) above other LTIP Units issued in the form of Multi-Year Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards in  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents 2021 or later (\u201cMYLTIP Awards\u201d), which remain subject to performance conditions.  An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of BXP\u2019s restricted common stock, although LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards are only entitled to receive one-tenth (1/10th) of the regular quarterly distributions (and no special distributions) prior to being earned.

The modified construction loan continues to mature on September 5, 2023, with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions.  100 Causeway Street is a premier workplace with approximately 630,000 net rentable square feet located in Boston, Massachusetts. Stock Option and Incentive Plan On February 1, 2022, BXP\u2019s Compensation Committee approved a new equity-based, multi-year, long-term incentive program (the \u201c2022 MYLTIP\u201d) as a performance-based component of our overall compensation program.  Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 718 \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation,\u201d the 2022 MYLTIP has an aggregate value of approximately $17.3\u00a0million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings under the graded vesting method (See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). On February 4, 2022, the measurement period for our 2019 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP\u2019s relative TSR performance, the final payout was determined to be 69.0% of target, or an aggregate of approximately $8.6\u00a0million (after giving effect to employee separations).  As a result, an aggregate of 144,043 2019 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited.  8 8 8  Table of Contents Table of Contents Business and Growth Strategies Business Strategies  Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return in all points of the economic cycle.  Our strategies to achieve this objective are: \u2022to target a few carefully selected dynamic gateway markets\u2014Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC\u2014and to be one of the leading, if not the leading, developers, owners and managers in each of those markets with a full-service office in each market providing property management, leasing, development, construction and legal expertise.  We select markets and submarkets with a diverse economic base and a deep pool of prospective clients in various industries and where clients have demonstrated a preference for premier workplaces and other facilities.  Additionally, our markets have historically been able to recruit new talent to them and as such created job growth that results in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time.  We have explored, and may continue to explore for future investment, select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits;   \u2022to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, finance and manage high-quality office and life sciences space, as well as selected retail and residential space; \u2022to take on complex, technically challenging development projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties that other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue; \u2022to own and develop high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of today\u2019s clients who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure, support services, sustainable features and amenities, including those amenities that enrich in-person experiences and support a hybrid work environment, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients; \u2022to opportunistically acquire assets that increase our market share in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate, as well as potential new markets, which exhibit an opportunity to improve returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and leasing; \u2022to explore joint venture opportunities with (1) existing property owners located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital and (2) expand our SCP, leveraging our skills as developers, owners and managers of premier workplaces and mixed-use complexes; \u2022to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties or interests therein, including core properties, to either (1) take advantage of the demand for our premier properties and realize the value we have created or (2) pare from our portfolio properties that we believe have slower future growth potential; \u2022to seek third-party development contracts to enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff, especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions; and \u2022to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital and proactively manage our debt expirations. Growth Strategies External Growth Strategies We believe that our development experience, our organizational depth, utilization of our SCP and our balance sheet position us to continue to selectively develop a range of premier workplaces, including high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments (including office, residential and retail), low-rise suburban office properties and life sciences space, within budget and on schedule.  We believe we are also well-positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions.  Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include: 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our markets that could support approximately 16.9 million additional square feet of new development (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); \u2022our reputation gained through 53 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties; \u2022our relationships with leading national corporations, universities and public institutions, including government agencies, seeking new facilities and development services; \u2022our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry; \u2022our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provide comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas; \u2022our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing;  \u2022our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets; \u2022our ability to procure entitlements from multiple municipalities to develop sites and attract land owners to sell or partner with us; and \u2022our relationship with domestic and foreign investors, including SCP partners, who seek to partner with companies like ours. Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories: \u2022Development in selected submarkets. We believe the selected development of well-positioned premier workplaces, including office, life sciences, residential buildings and mixed-use complexes may be justified in our markets.  We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time.  While we purposely concentrate in markets with high barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 53-year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms.  We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential. In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development.  Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value.  We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment. Our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities.  We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles. \u2022Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals. We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria.  In addition, we believe that our market knowledge and our liquidity and access to capital may provide us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions.  Opportunities to acquire properties may also come through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt.  We are also able to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property for equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution.  Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or BXP\u2019s common stock may facilitate these types  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents of acquisitions on a tax-efficient basis.  Existing promulgated Treasury regulations may limit the tax benefits previously available to sellers in some variations of these transactions. \u2022Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets. We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions, owners of real estate and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies, repositioning/redevelopment expertise and a responsive property management program.  Internal Growth Strategies We believe that opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties through an increase in occupancy and rental rates because they are of high quality and in desirable locations.  Additionally, our markets have diversified economies that have historically experienced job growth and increased use of office space, resulting in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time.  Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is three-fold: (1) to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage clients to renew, expand and relocate in our properties, (2) to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing clients through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant and capital improvements and (3) to work with new or existing clients with space expansion or contraction needs, leveraging our expertise and clustering of assets to maximize the cash flow from our assets.  We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to:  \u2022Cultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit clients. In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers and amenities, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors. The weighted-average lease term of our in-place leases based on square feet, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.9 years at December\u00a031, 2022, and we continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high-quality, financially stable clients.  Based on leases in place at December\u00a031, 2022, leases with respect to approximately 5.1% of the total square feet in our portfolio, including unconsolidated joint ventures, will expire in calendar year 2023.\u00a0 \u2022Directly manage our office properties to maximize the potential for client retention. We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to client needs.  We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in client relations.  In addition, we reinvest in our properties by adding new services and amenities that are desirable to our clients.   \u2022Replace clients quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs. We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new clients and achieve relatively high rental and occupancy rates as a result of our well-located, well-designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to clients, and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets. \u2022Extend terms of existing leases to existing clients prior to expiration. We have also successfully structured early client renewals, which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy clients on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships. \u2022Re-development of existing assets.  We believe the select re-development of assets within our portfolio, where through the ability to increase the building size and/or to increase cash flow and generate appropriate returns on incremental investment after consideration of the asset\u2019s current and future cash flows, may be desirable. This generally occurs in situations in which we are able to increase the building\u2019s size, improve building systems, including conversion to higher yielding life sciences uses, and sustainability features, and/or add client amenities, thereby increasing client demand, generating acceptable returns on incremental investment and enhancing the long-term value of the property and the company.  In the past, we have been particularly successful at gaining local government approval for  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents increased density at several of our assets, providing the opportunity to enhance value at a particular location.  Our strong regional relationships and recognized re-development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities.  We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn attractive returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles.  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Our Strategy We actively work to promote our growth and operations in a sustainable and responsible manner across our six regions.  The BXP ESG strategy is to conduct our business, the development, ownership and operation of new and existing buildings, in a manner that contributes to positive economic, social and environmental outcomes for our clients, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve.  Our investment philosophy is shaped by our core strategy of long-term ownership and our commitment to our communities and the centers of commerce and civic life that make them thrive.  We are focused on developing and maintaining healthy, high-performance buildings, while simultaneously mitigating operational costs and the potential external impacts of energy, water, waste, greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions and climate change.  Positive social impact is also of great importance to BXP and our employees, which is exhibited by our commitments to charitable giving, volunteerism, public realm investments and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace and our communities.  Through these efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and broader society while mutually benefiting our stakeholders. ESG Leadership We continue to address the needs of our stakeholders by making efforts to maintain and improve our ESG performance across three pillars: climate action, climate resilience and social good.  BXP is a widely recognized industry leader in ESG. 2022 ESG highlights include: \u2022BXP ranked among the top real estate companies in the GRESB assessment, earning a seventh consecutive 5-Star rating. 2022 was the eleventh consecutive year that BXP earned the GRESB \u201cGreen Star\u201d designation \u2022BXP\u2019s MSCI rating improved from an A to AA, and CDP score improved from C to B  \u2022BXP was named to Newsweek\u2019s List of America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies in 2023 for the third consecutive year. BXP ranked first in the Real Estate & Housing industry with an increased ranking of 29th overall out of the 500 companies and received the third highest environmental score  \u2022BXP was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) North America for the second consecutive year. BXP was one of eight real estate companies that qualified and the only office REIT in the index, scoring in the 95th percentile of the real estate companies assessed for inclusion  \u2022BXP was recognized by Commercial Property Executive for having the \u201cBest ESG Program\u201d \u2022BXP was the recipient of Nareit\u2019s prestigious Leader in the Light Award  \u2022BXP was named an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year \u2013 Sustained Excellence Award Winner \u2022BXP was recognized as an inaugural Platinum Level Green Lease Leader by the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy  Our leadership position is due, in part, to our establishment of environmental goals, the periodic reporting of progress towards our goals and the achievement of these goals.  We have publicly adopted energy, emissions, water and waste goals that establish reduction targets aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  As of the end of 2021, the combined impacts of efficiency measures, renewable energy and reduced physical occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 41% decrease in energy use intensity and over 70% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity below a 2008 base year.  We have also aligned our emissions reduction targets with climate science and in 2020 became the first North American office REIT to establish an emissions reduction target ambition in line with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory, the most ambitious designation available at the time of submission under the Science Based Targets initiative.  In April 2021, we affirmed our commitment to achieving carbon-neutral operations (for direct and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions) by 2025 from our occupied and actively managed buildings where we have operational control. 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents We are focused on developing, owning and operating healthy and high-performance buildings.  BXP is a corporate member of the U.S. Green Building Council\u00ae (\u201cUSGBC\u201d) and has a long history of green buildings under USGBC\u2019s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design\u2122 (LEED\u00ae) rating system.  As of December 31, 2022, we have LEED-certified 33.5 million square feet of our total in-service portfolio, of which 94% is certified at the highest Gold and Platinum levels.  In 2018, we announced a partnership with a leading healthy building certification system, Fitwel, to support healthy building design and operational practices across our portfolio, becoming a Fitwel Champion.  We completed our Fitwel Champion commitments and have added 23.8 million square feet of Fitwel certified buildings across our total in-service portfolio since 2018.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we completed the Fitwel Viral Response Module Enterprise and Asset-level Certification at all actively managed buildings.  Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\u201cSASB\u201d) Disclosures The Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by SASB in 2018 proposed sustainability accounting metrics designed for disclosure in mandatory filings, such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and serves as the framework against which we have aligned our disclosures for sustainability information.  The recommended energy and water management activity metrics for the real estate industry include energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of floor area (\u201cEnergy Intensity\u201d); percentage of the eligible portfolio that is certified ENERGY STAR\u00ae (\u201cENERGY STAR certified\u201d); total energy consumed by portfolio area (\u201cTotal Energy Consumption\u201d); water withdrawal as a percentage of total floor area (\u201cWater Intensity\u201d); and total water withdrawn by portfolio area (\u201cTotal Water Consumption\u201d).  Our energy and water data is collected from utility bills and submeters and is assured by an independent, third party assurance expert, which includes all SASB 2021 energy and water metrics.  For more information on the independent, third-party assurance expert and the methodology used to assure the data, refer to \u201cReporting\u201d below.  During the 2021 calendar year, 46 buildings representing 43% of our eligible portfolio were ENERGY STAR certified.  A licensed professional has verified all ENERGY STAR applications. The charts below detail our Energy Intensity, Total Energy Consumption, Water Intensity and Total Water Consumption for 2015 through 2021 for which data were available on occupied and actively managed buildings where we had operational control.1,2,3,4,5,6  _______________ (1)Full 2022 calendar year energy and water data will not be available and assured by a third party until March 31, 2023.

Climate Resilience As a long-term owner and active manager of real estate assets in operation and under development, we take a long-term view on climate change risks and opportunities.  We are focused on understanding how climate change may impact the performance of our portfolio and the steps we can take to increase climate resilience.  We continue to evaluate the potential risks associated with climate change that could impact our portfolio and are taking proactive steps to plan for and/or mitigate such risks.  \u00d8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Governance As a vertically integrated, full-service real estate company, we are engaged in addressing climate-related issues at all levels of our organization.  Management\u2019s role in overseeing, assessing and managing climate-related risks, opportunities and initiatives is spread across multiple teams throughout our organization, including our Board of Directors, executive leadership and our Sustainability, Risk Management, Development, Construction and Property Management Departments.  BXP has a dedicated team of sustainability professionals focused on ESG issues that coordinate and collaborate across corporate and regional teams to advance environmental sustainability issues and initiatives.  Our Board of Directors has established a board-level Sustainability Committee to, among other things, increase Board oversight over environmental and sustainability issues, including climate-related risks and opportunities.  The Board delegated to the Sustainability Committee its responsibility to oversee BXP\u2019s sustainability program, which includes monitoring and addressing, as needed, environmental-, sustainability- and climate-related risks.  Our approach to climate-related issues is also informed by robust stakeholder engagement.  We are in frequent dialogue with investors, customers, community members, governmental policymakers, consultants and other non-governmental organizations.  We are heavily involved in industry associations and participate in conferences and workshops covering ESG, sustainability and climate resilience topics.  Through these engagements, we enhance our knowledge of climate-related issues and those issues that are most important to our stakeholders and industry best practices.   \u00d8 Strategy We have aligned our climate-related disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d).  The TCFD framework has informed the development of our strategy for identifying and managing both physical and transition risks associated with climate change.  As defined by the TCFD framework, physical risks associated with climate change include acute risks (extreme weather-related events) and chronic risks (such as extreme heat and sea-level rise), and transition risks associated with climate change include policy and legal risks, and other technology, market and reputation-related risks.  We continue to proactively assess the potential risks that may impact the properties in our portfolio, gather information and monitor the evolving regulatory landscape related to climate change.  Our process for assessing climate-related risks and their implications on our properties and business includes a climate change scenario analyses that was conducted in 2021 on our portfolio assets.  In particular, we engaged Moody\u2019s ESG Solutions (formerly branded as Four Twenty Seven Application), an independent provider of science-driven insights and analytics on climate risk, for its climate risk scoring to evaluate the forward-looking physical climate risk exposure of our entire portfolio.  The scenario analysis and physical risk scoring was based on an RCP 8.5 emissions scenario, which is a worst-case, high emissions scenario, under a time horizon up to 2040.  The scenario analysis included all in-service assets owned by BXP and included climate events such as hurricane, wildfire, heat, water stress, flooding and sea-level rise.  We are also using Moody\u2019s ESG Solutions data to identify potential risks during the new acquisition diligence process.  The analysis of our portfolio yielded no material findings.  We consider climate-related risks and opportunities in the context of the following time horizons: short-term (1-2 years), medium-term (3-10 years) and long-term (>10 years).  Based on the foregoing process for evaluating climate-related risks, including the scenario analysis, we have identified (1) the following potential physical and transition risks associated with climate change that could impact our portfolio in the future across the stated time horizons and (2) our climate-related opportunities.  We will continue to analyze the results of the Moody\u2019s ESG Solutions analysis and the following risks and opportunities to understand our potential  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents exposure and inform our climate resilience strategy and future investments, which include climate-related risk mitigation and initiatives.

Our risk management program includes physical and transition risks, including both climate mitigation (resource efficiency and emissions reduction) and adaptation (integration of climate resilience into our investment decision-making).  We are actively acquiring, developing and operating a geographically diverse portfolio of high-quality commercial real estate properties.  Individual assets have unique risk profiles and insurance requirements. Through the processes of acquisition, development and operation of our in-service portfolio, our experienced real estate professionals are identifying risks, including business continuity risks, loss exposure related to extreme weather events and impacts of regulation, including permitting requirements, codes, and energy and carbon performance standards.  The climate risk profile of each individual property is largely dependent on the property\u2019s unique attributes, physical location and jurisdictional regulatory requirements. Asset-Level Risk Management We carry all-risk property insurance on our properties including those under development. Insurance coverage mitigates the impact to BXP from losses associated with natural catastrophes, such as floods, fires, earthquakes and wind events.  We are preparing for long-term climate risk by considering climate change scenarios and expect that we will continue to assess climate change vulnerabilities resulting from potential future climate scenarios and sea-level rise.  We will continue to evaluate existing plans and procedures and proactively implement practical, cost-effective resiliency measures and infrastructure enhancements, including: \u2022Business Continuity Plans \u2022Emergency Response and Life Safety Plans \u2022Emergency Evacuation Planning, Procedures and Drills \u2022Client Engagement and Coordination \u2022Life Safety Analysis \u2022Elevation of vault, switchgear and critical equipment during new development \u2022Waterproofing of subgrade infrastructure \u2022Floodable first floors \u2022Temporary flood barriers \u2022Backup generation, emergency lighting and fire pumps \u2022Onsite energy resources and distributed generation, storage and solar photovoltaic systems. We are managing transition risks by benchmarking energy, carbon, water and waste performance at the asset level and are prioritizing interventions at underperforming assets.  We develop, operate and maintain a large portfolio of buildings that are LEED, ENERGY STAR and/or Fitwel certified.  As of December 31, 2022, 85% of our actively managed portfolio was certified under one or more of these frameworks.  As a leader in green building, we will continue to make investments in building performance, energy efficiency and decarbonization. Through our climate action efforts, we believe we can play a leading role in advancing the transition to a low-carbon economy and are taking action to decarbonize operations.  GHG sources include the generated electricity and steam at offsite generation facilities, the onsite combustion of fuels (e.g., natural gas), and emissions associated with other business activities, including business travel and new development.  We continue to explore and implement creative and cost-effective measures that reduce GHG emissions from our operations.  BXP became a proud signatory of the We Are Still In pledge after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and has aligned emissions reduction targets with climate science.  The SBTi Target Validation Team has classified BXP\u2019s emissions reduction target ambition and has determined that it is in line with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory, the most ambitious designation available at the time of submission.  We are committed to achieving carbon-neutral operations, or net-zero carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, which includes direct and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emission, by 2025 from our occupied and actively managed buildings where we have operational control.  16 16 16 Table of Contents Table of Contents BXP\u2019s Carbon-Neutral Operations Strategy  Our strategy to achieve carbon-neutral operations includes the following goals: (1)Energy Efficient Operations \u2013 Approximately 1/3 of total carbon reductions by 2025 (below a 2008 base year) from energy conservation and efficient operations. (2)Renewable Energy \u2013 Advancement of onsite development of renewable energy systems and sourcing offsite renewable energy to meet 100% of our electricity needs by 2025.  (3)Electrification \u2013 Explore and advance electrification, prioritizing electrification of new developments and replacement of onsite gas-fired systems at existing buildings at the end of their useful lives.  (4)Carbon Offsets \u2013 To the extent necessary, offset any remaining emissions during the transition to carbon-free energy. The resilience of our markets may depend on the action taken by cities to adapt transportation, energy, and communication infrastructure for extreme heat, weather events, sea-level rise and flooding.  We will continue to encourage the adaptation of our cities and management of physical and transition risks by maintaining a voice in policy decision-making at the local level through direct engagement and/or advocacy through collective membership-based groups.  \u00d8 Metrics We closely monitor energy consumption and associated GHG emissions and provide detailed accounting of ESG key performance indicators in our annual ESG reporting.  As of the end of 2021, the combined impacts of efficiency measures, renewable energy and reduced physical occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 41% decrease in energy use intensity and an over 70% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity below a 2008 base year.  BXP\u2019s carbon-neutral commitment includes direct and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our actively managed  portfolio where we have operational control.  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions include emissions associated with total landlord-controlled energy use.  Scope 1 emissions include all emissions associated with the onsite combustion of fossil fuels for heating, hot water and standby generators.  Scope 2 emissions include all emissions associated with the offsite generation of electricity and steam.  As our business continues to grow, carbon reduction targets and the transparent disclosure of ESG metrics will remain a priority.   Reporting A notable part of our commitment to sustainable development and operations is our commitment to transparent reporting of ESG performance indicators, as we recognize the importance of this information to investors, lenders and others in understanding how BXP assesses sustainability information and evaluates risks and opportunities.  We publish an annual ESG report that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Framework, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the SASB Framework.  BXP\u2019s ESG Report includes our strategy, key performance indicators, annual like-for-like comparisons, and achievements.  The report is available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading \u201cCommitment.\u201d   Our annual ESG reports, including all of our energy, water and emissions metrics included therein, are assured by an independent, third-party assurance expert.  The assurance expert performs an independent verification for certain of our ESG performance indicators and issues an opinion, which is attached to each ESG report, that opines on each ESG report\u2019s inclusiveness, materiality, sustainability context, completeness, and reliability.   We have been an active participant in the green bond market since 2018, which provides access to sustainability-focused investors interested in the positive environmental externalities of our business activities.  Since 2018, BPLP has issued an aggregate of $4.3 billion of green bonds in five separate offerings.  The terms of the green bonds have restrictions that limit our allocation of the net proceeds to \u201celigible green projects.\u201d  We publish Green Bond Allocation Reports disclosing the full or partial allocation, as applicable, of net proceeds from the green bond offerings to eligible green projects.  We have published four Green Bond Allocation Reports that fully allocate more than $3.5 billion in net proceeds to eligible green projects.  The Green Bond Allocation Reports are available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading \u201cCommitment.\u201d  We expect to publish a Green Bond Allocation Report to allocate net proceeds from our most recent November 2022 green bond offering in the fourth quarter of 2023.  17 17 17 Table of Contents Table of Contents Except for the documents specifically incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Human Capital Management Our culture supports and nurtures our employees.  Our employees are a significant distinguishing factor that sets BXP apart.  As of December 31, 2022, we had 675 non-union employees (we had 780 employees, inclusive of union employees).  All data provided in this Human Capital Management section refers to BXP\u2019s non-union employee workforce as the unions control primary aspects of the hiring process.  Our operational and financial performance depends on their talents, energy, experience and well-being.  Our ability to attract and retain talented people depends on a number of factors, including work environment, career development and professional training, compensation and benefits, and the health, safety and wellness of our employees.  We have an established reputation for excellence and integrity and these core values are inherent in our culture and play a critical role in achieving our goals and overall success.   Diversity, Equity & Inclusion  We strive to create a diverse and inclusive workplace.  It has been, and will continue to be, our policy to recruit, hire, assign, promote and train in all job titles without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations.  By implementing this policy, we aim to ensure that all employees have the opportunity to make their maximum contribution to us and to their own career goals. BXP\u2019s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council (the \u201cDEI Council\u201d) is an executive-sponsored, voluntary and employee-led committee unified by BXP\u2019s mission to promote diversity, equity, inclusion and transparency as part of our organization\u2019s culture, decision-making practices and business activities, while also providing a mechanism for positive impact in the communities in which we operate.  Since its formation in 2020, the DEI Council has grown to over 33 Council members across our six regions, and each member contributes to the overall mission through leadership in one or more of the DEI Council\u2019s three committees \u2013 the Recruiting & Development Committee, the Company Policies Committee and the Community Outreach Committee \u2013 and/or three employee resource groups (\u201cERGs\u201d).  Including ERG members, as of December 31, 2022, BXP\u2019s DEI community consisted of 244 members, or 36% of BXP\u2019s workforce.   The DEI Council in collaboration with BXP\u2019s CEO, President and Human Resources Department annually identify actionable diversity goals and proposes initiatives to advance its mission.  In 2022, the DEI Council\u2019s focus areas were: (1) training and workforce education, (2) recruiting and onboarding, (3) employee engagement, (4) social responsibility, (5) transparency and communication and (6) governance.  BXP\u2019s notable achievements for 2022 include: \u2022Training & Workforce Education \u25e6Conducted a two-part training for DEI Council members to enhance DEI leadership skills \u25e6Continued cultural awareness education for the BXP workforce through interactive DEI event offerings, consistent communications with educational content regarding cultural holidays and awareness months and collaboration with property management teams to enhance visibility of important DEI dates and celebrations across BXP\u2019s properties \u2022Recruiting & Onboarding \u25e657% women and 39% ethnically diverse new hires in 2022 \u25e64.5% increase in ethnically diverse employees and 6.5% increase in ethnically diverse officers compared to the 2020 base year \u25e62.0% increase in women employees and 9.0% increase in women officers compared to the 2020 base year \u25e6Launched partnerships with CareerSpring and Project Destined to further enhance BXP\u2019s community involvement, BXP employees\u2019 volunteerism, as well as expand BXP\u2019s diverse candidate pools to include program alumni and young professionals 18 18 18 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u25e6Contracted with recruiting firms with intentionality to include women- and/or minority-owned businesses or businesses with DEI programs, which represented, as of December 2022, approximately 50% of BXP\u2019s contracted recruiting firms  \u2022Employee Engagement \u25e6Launched three ERGs designed to connect employees who have similar backgrounds and shared experiences with the goal of working with BXP on diversity, equity and inclusion, bringing people together to share experiences and best practices, and ensuring that we are supporting each other across our communities \u25e6Participation rate across BXP for the ERGs\u2019 inaugural year totaled approximately 25% of all employees \u2022Social Responsibility \u25e6Continued to facilitate relationships with minority-owned businesses to provide commercial real estate space \u25e6Conducted a comprehensive review of vendors identified as underrepresented business enterprises (\u201cUBEs\u201d) with the aim of increasing UBE usage by BXP resulting in a 34% year-over-year increase in UBE usage compared to 2021 \u25e6Commenced a new depository relationship with a Black-owned bank and continued our partnership with a minority- and women-owned bank in our 2022 unsecured notes offering \u25e6Increased community involvement through, among other efforts, regional charitable contributions to DEI-associated initiatives in our regions \u2022Transparency & Communication \u25e6Dedicated a company-wide Town Hall discussion to BXP\u2019s DEI initiatives, achievements and future programming led by the DEI Council\u2019s co-chairs  \u25e6Launched DEI Council page on BXP\u2019s internal portal that provides DEI resources and announces future events, initiatives and other information \u2022Governance \u25e6Formalized charters and mission statements for the DEI Council and each ERG \u25e6Undertook a voluntary refreshment process of DEI Council members to ensure appropriate representation across backgrounds, experience and regions that resulted in a 55% increase in DEI Council membership since its formation  19 19 19 Table of Contents Table of Contents Diversity, Equity & Inclusion at BXP(1) TOTAL WORKFORCE(2)(3)MANAGER & ABOVE(2)(3)BOARD OF DIRECTORS TOTAL WORKFORCE(2)(3) MANAGER & ABOVE(2)(3)    \u00a0_______________ (1) As of December 31, 2022.

Culture & Employee Engagement We believe that the success of our business is tied to the quality of our workforce, and we strive to maintain a corporate environment without losing the entrepreneurial spirit with which we were founded more than 50 years ago. By providing a quality workplace and comprehensive benefit programs, we recognize the commitment of our employees to bring their talent, energy, and experience to us.  Our continued success is attributable to our employees\u2019 expertise and dedication.  We periodically conduct employee engagement surveys to monitor our employees\u2019 satisfaction in different aspects of their employment, including company performance, leadership, communication, career development and benefits offerings.  Past employee responsiveness to the engagement surveys has been consistently high and the results help inform us on matters that our employees view as key contributors to a positive work experience.  Based on the most recent employee engagement survey conducted in 2022, with 96% responsiveness, the overall company-wide result was a \u201cfavorable\u201d rating.  The highest scoring statement on the survey with a 94% favorability score was \u201cBXP conducts its business in accordance with the highest standards and ethical conduct.\u201d  We intend to continue to periodically evaluate employee engagement as needed on a meaningful basis.  Another indicator of the success of our efforts in the workplace is the long tenure of our employees, 35% of whom have worked at BXP for ten or more years.  The average tenure of our employees is approximately 9.42 years and that of our officers is 17.65 years.  In 2022, our voluntary workforce turnover rate was 15%.  Career Development & Training  We invest significant resources in our employees\u2019 personal and professional growth and development and provide a wide range of tools and development opportunities that build and strengthen employees\u2019 leadership and  20 20 20 Table of Contents Table of Contents professional skills.  These development opportunities include in-person and virtual training sessions, in-house learning opportunities, various management trainings, departmental conferences, executive townhalls and external programs.  We foster an environment of growth and internal promotion and strive for a best-in-class candidate experience for our internal applicants.  Open positions are posted, and employees are highly encouraged to apply for promotion within the organization.  For 2022, 16% of our employees were promoted to elevated roles within our organization.  Of the employees promoted, 50% were women and 29% were non-White. Compensation & Benefits We designed our compensation program with the goal of providing a balanced and effective way of ensuring internal equity and market competitiveness in our pay practices.  We have coupled external, market-driven data with an equitable performance review assessment tool to strike the balance that best represents our compensation strategy and links pay to performance.  On an annual basis, our Human Resources department evaluates market compensation ranges for each position to ensure we are appropriately compensating our top performers.  We believe this total rewards program directly aligns with our compensation and benefits strategy. Our employee benefit programs are designed to meet the needs of our diverse workforce, support our employees and their families by offering comprehensive and competitive programs that provide flexibility and choice in coverage, make available valuable resources to protect and enhance financial security and help balance work and personal life.  Some of the benefits that we offer our employees include: \u2022health (including telehealth), dental and vision insurance,  \u2022a 401(k) plan with a generous matching contribution,  \u2022an employee stock purchase plan,  \u2022health care and dependent care flexible spending accounts,  \u2022income protection through our sick pay, salary continuation and long-term disability policies and life insurance,  \u2022a scholarship program for the children of non-officer employees,  \u2022a commuter subsidy to support the use of public transportation,  \u2022tuition reimbursement, \u2022paid vacation, holiday, personal and volunteer days and paid parental leave to balance work and personal life, \u2022back-up child and elder care, and \u2022pet insurance. Health, Safety & Wellness As one of the largest publicly traded premier workplace REITs (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2022) in the United States, we are keenly aware of the influence of buildings on human health and its importance to our clients and employees.  The health, safety and security of our employees, clients, contractors and others are our highest priority.  In early 2020, we convened a Health Security Task Force and developed the BXP Health Security Plan, a comprehensive set of building operational measures, to address health and safety measures in our buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Some components of the Health Security Plan remained applicable and in place in 2022: we continued to focus on our indoor air quality initiative and installed new indoor air quality monitoring devices across approximately 40 buildings in 2022 that provide real-time indoor air quality data, maintained enhanced air filtration in buildings and continued to conduct air and water quality testing.  We believe the success of our employees is dependent upon their overall well-being, including their physical health, mental health, work-life balance and financial well-being.  In addition to the benefits outlined above, we also offer our employees an Employee Wellness Program, an Employee Assistance Program and a Mental Health Well-Being Program.  The Employee Wellness Program was established in 2016 to encourage employees to improve their health and well-being by offering a variety of activities and engaging content to meet individual wellness goals.  Program participants receive a reduction in their health insurance deduction cost.  The Employee Assistance Program includes services for childcare, eldercare, personal relationship information, financial planning assistance, stress management, mental illness and general wellness and self-help.  BXP offers a premium mental health program that provides online resources and support for employees facing a wide variety of issues. 21 21 21  Table of Contents Table of Contents Policies with Respect to Certain Activities The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies.  These policies have been determined by BXP\u2019s Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by the Board of Directors. Investment Policies Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends/distributions to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in our value.  We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives. We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development and redevelopment projects and other acquired properties.  We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential, primarily in our existing markets of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.  We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment in select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits.  Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets.  We intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of BXP\u2019s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant.  We do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants. We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership.  These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio. Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments.  Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to BXP\u2019s common stock.  Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d).\u00a0 Investments in Real Estate Mortgages While our current portfolio consists primarily of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of BXP, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with BXP\u2019s qualification as a REIT.  Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment.  We may invest in participating, convertible or traditional mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow, or any appreciation in value of the property or as an entrance to the fee ownership.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had one note receivable outstanding, which was approximately $78.6 million.  Securities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for BXP\u2019s REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. Dispositions We decide to dispose or partially dispose of properties based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors of BXP that doing so is in our best interests.  Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors of BXP or a committee thereof.  Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to BXP.  Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have  22 22 22 Table of Contents Table of Contents different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale.  Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain.  Generally, this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction.  Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by a sale.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had one property that was subject to a tax protection agreement, which may limit our ability to dispose of the asset or require us to pay damages to the prior owner in the event of a taxable sale in violation of the agreement.  The tax protection agreement expires on December 14, 2033, or earlier if certain conditions by the prior owner are met. Financing Policies\u00a0 The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and BXP\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur.  Further, we do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur, nor have we established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole.  However, our mortgages, credit facilities, joint venture agreements and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness.  In addition, we evaluate the impact of incremental leverage on our debt metrics and the credit ratings of BPLP\u2019s publicly traded debt.  A reduction in BPLP\u2019s credit ratings could result in us borrowing money at higher interest rates. The Board of Directors of BXP will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing, the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and us as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service.\u00a0 Policies with Respect to Other Activities As the sole general partner of BPLP, BXP has the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP.  BXP has issued, and may in the future issue, common or preferred units of limited partnership interest to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units.  We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BXP and BPLP does not intend to do so.  At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to enable BXP to maintain its qualification as a REIT, unless, due to changes in circumstances or to the Code, the Board of Directors of BXP determines that it is no longer in the best interest of BXP to qualify as a REIT.  We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate or in connection with the disposition of a property.  We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act.  Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors of BXP.\u00a0 Governmental Regulations General Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material.  We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, (1) federal securities laws and regulations, (2) applicable stock exchange requirements, and (3) federal, state and local laws and regulations related to (a) our status as a REIT and other tax laws and regulations, and (b) real property, the improvements thereon and the operation thereof, such as laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, zoning, usage, building, fire and life safety codes, (4) the requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury and (5) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  In addition to the discussion below, see \u201cItem 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of these governmental regulations and other material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, and see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings. 23 23 23 Table of Contents Table of Contents Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties.  These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect.  However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.\u00a0 For example, in February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination.  We developed an office park on the property.  We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction.  Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1)\u00a0bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2)\u00a0continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3)\u00a0indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions.  Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses and contractual limitations, including time limits, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.\u00a0 Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties.  In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities.  In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site.  We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases.  Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable.  Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.\u00a0 Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination.  Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner.  In these situations, it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination, including potential issues associated with vapor intrusion concerns and/or potential contaminant migration to or from the subject property in ground water, assess potential liability risks and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures.  We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition, deal structure and/or development of the property.  For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility.  Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants.  We have developed an office park on this property.  Prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization.  A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site.  The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws.\u00a0 We expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties, that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.\u00a0 24 24 24  Table of Contents Table of Contents Corporate Governance BXP is currently governed by an eleven-member Board of Directors.

A copy of this code is available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading \u201cInvestors\u201d and subheading \u201cGovernance\u201d with the name \u201cCode of Business Conduct and Ethics.\u201d  BXP intends to disclose on this website any amendment to, or waiver of, any provisions of this Code applicable to the directors and executive officers of BXP that would otherwise be required to be disclosed under the rules of the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange.   \u2022The Board of Directors has established an ethics reporting system that employees may use to anonymously report possible violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, including concerns regarding questionable accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, by telephone or over the internet. \u2022The Board of Directors has adopted a Policy on our Political Spending, a copy of which is available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading \u201cInvestors\u201d and the subheading \u201cGovernance\u201d with the name \u201cPolicy on Political Spending.\u201d 25 25 25  Table of Contents Table of Contents Competition We compete in the leasing of premier workplace, retail and residential space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us.  In addition, our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our one hotel, Marriott International, Inc.\u00a0 Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing premier workplaces are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of client services and amenities provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of premier workplaces in the relevant market.  Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends in the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective clients, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.\u00a0 In addition, we currently have six residential properties (including one under construction) and may in the future decide to acquire or develop additional residential properties.  As an owner, we will also face competition for prospective residents from other operators/owners whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks.  We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent.  Because the scale of our residential portfolio is relatively small, we expect to continue to retain third parties to manage our residential properties. Our Hotel Property We operate our hotel property through a taxable REIT subsidiary.  The taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to a lease for the hotel property.  As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property.  The hotel lease is intended to provide the economic benefits of ownership of the underlying real estate to flow to us as rental income, while our taxable REIT subsidiary earns the profit or loss from operating the property as a hotel.  Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements.  Marriott has been engaged under a separate long-term incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary.  Supplemental United States Federal Income Tax Considerations The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under \u201cUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d in the prospectus dated May 22, 2020 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on May 22, 2020 (such disclosure, the \u201cBase Disclosure\u201d).  Capitalized terms herein that are not otherwise defined shall have the same meaning as when used in the Base Disclosure. On December 29, 2022, the IRS promulgated final Treasury Regulations under Sections 897, 1441, 1445, and 1446 of the Code that were, in part, intended to coordinate various withholding regimes for non-U.S. stockholders.  The new Treasury Regulations provide guidance regarding qualified foreign pension funds and are largely consistent with the previously issued proposed Treasury Regulations.   Accordingly, the third and fourth sentences of the third paragraph under the heading \u201cUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014Taxation of Stockholders and Potential Tax Consequences of Their Investment in Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock\u2014Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders\u2014Dispositions of Stock\u201d are hereby deleted and replaced with the following: Under Treasury Regulations, subject to the discussion below regarding \u201cqualified holders,\u201d  a \u201cqualified controlled entity\u201d also is not generally treated as a non-U.S. stockholder for purposes of FIRPTA. A qualified controlled entity generally includes a trust or corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country all of the interests of which are held by one or more qualified foreign pension funds either directly or indirectly through one or more qualified controlled entities. 26 26 26 Table of Contents Table of Contents Additionally, the following two paragraphs are added after the third paragraph under the heading \u201cUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014Taxation of Stockholders and Potential Tax Consequences of Their Investment in Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock\u2014Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders\u2014Dispositions of Stock\u201d: Treasury Regulations further require that a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity will not be exempt from FIRPTA with respect to dispositions of USRPIs or REIT distributions attributable to the same unless the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is a \u201cqualified holder.\u201d  To be a qualified holder, a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity must satisfy one of two alternative tests at the time of the disposition of the USRPI or the REIT distribution. Under the first test, a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder if it owned no USRPIs as of the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition or distribution during which it qualified as a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity. Alternatively, if a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity held USRPIs as of the earliest date during the period described in the preceding sentence, it can be a qualified holder only if it satisfies certain testing period requirements.   Treasury Regulations also provide that a foreign partnership, all of the interests of which are held by qualified holders, including through one or more partnerships, may certify its status as such and will not be treated as a non-U.S. stockholder for purposes of withholding under FIRPTA.
