A reference to a \u201cNote\u201d refers to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  History AT&T, formerly known as SBC Communications Inc. (SBC), was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.\u2019s (ATTC) local telephone companies. On January 1, 1984, we were spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider.   Following our formation, we expanded our communications footprint and operations and invested in entertainment businesses, most significantly: \u2022Our subsidiaries merged with incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) Pacific Telesis Group in 1997 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999. \u2022In 2005, we merged one of our subsidiaries with ATTC, creating one of the world\u2019s leading telecommunications providers. In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from \u201cSBC Communications Inc.\u201d to \u201cAT&T Inc.\u201d \u2022In 2006, we acquired ILEC BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth), which included BellSouth\u2019s 40 percent economic interest in AT&T Mobility LLC (AT&T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, resulting in 100 percent ownership of AT&T Mobility. \u2022In 2014, we completed the acquisition of wireless provider Leap Wireless International, Inc.  \u2022In 2015, we acquired wireless properties in Mexico and acquired DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States (included in our Video business) and Latin America (referred to as Vrio). \u2022From 2018 through April 2022, we acquired and held various investments in entertainment businesses, namely Time Warner Inc., which comprised a substantial portion of our WarnerMedia segment. \u2022In July 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction (DIRECTV Transaction), we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method. \u2022In April 2022, we completed the separation of our WarnerMedia business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction). Upon its separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations, as did other dispositions that were part of a single plan, including Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic). These businesses are reflected in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia separation.  1 1 1 AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts General We are a leading provider of telecommunications and technology services globally. The services and products that we offer vary by market and utilize various technology platforms in a range of geographies. Our reportable segments are organized as follows:  The Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units: \u2022Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment. \u2022Business Wireline provides advanced ethernet-based fiber services, IP Voice and managed professional services, as well as traditional voice and data services and related equipment to business customers. \u2022Consumer Wireline provides broadband services, including fiber connections that provide our multi-gig services to residential customers in select locations. Consumer Wireline also provides legacy telephony voice communication services.  The Latin America segment provides wireless services and equipment in Mexico.   Corporate and Other reconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes.   Corporate includes: \u2022DTV-related retained costs, which are costs previously allocated to the Video business that were retained after the transaction, net of reimbursements from DIRECTV under transition service agreements. \u2022Parent administration support, which includes costs borne by AT&T where the business units do not influence decision making. \u2022Securitization fees associated with our sales of receivables (see Note 17). \u2022Value portfolio, which are businesses no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market.   Other items consist of: \u2022Video, which includes our former U.S. video operations that were contributed to DIRECTV on July 31, 2021, and our share of DIRECTV\u2019s earnings as equity in net income of affiliates (see Note 19). \u2022Held-for-sale and other reclassifications, which includes our former Crunchyroll, Government Solutions and wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \u2022Reclassification of prior service credits, which includes the reclassification of prior service credit amortization, where we present the impact of benefit plan amendments in our business unit results. Prior service credit amortization is presented in \u201cOther income (expense) - net\u201d in the consolidated statements of income and therefore has no impact on consolidated operating income or EBITDA (EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization). \u2022Certain significant items,\u00a0which includes items associated with the merger and integration of acquired or divested businesses, including amortization of intangible assets, employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, asset impairments and abandonments and restructuring, and other items for which the segments are not being evaluated. \u2022Eliminations and consolidations, which removes transactions involving dealings between Mobility and our Video business, prior to the July 31, 2021 separation of Video.  Areas of Focus We are a leader in providing connectivity services through our market focus areas of 5G and fiber. Fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, both wired and wireless. Building on that fiber foundation is our solid spectrum portfolio, strengthened through recent years\u2019 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction acquisitions and 5G deployment. We believe our hybrid fixed wireline and mobile approach will differentiate our services and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future as bandwidth demands continue to grow. We will continue to demonstrate our commitment to ensure management attention is sharply focused on growth areas and operational efficiencies.  Communications Our integrated telecommunications network utilizes different technological platforms to provide instant connectivity at the higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements. Streaming, augmented reality, \u201csmart\u201d technologies and user generated content are expected to continue to drive greater demand for broadband and capitalize on our fiber and 5G deployments. During 2023, we will continue to develop and provide high-value, integrated mobile and broadband solutions.  Wireless Service We continue to experience rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices, and businesses and municipalities are connecting more and more equipment and facilities to the internet. The deployment of 5G, which allows for faster connectivity, lower latency and greater bandwidth, requires modifications of existing cell sites to add equipment supporting new frequencies, like the C-Band and the 3.45 GHz band. Our  2 2 2 AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts 5G service went nationwide in July 2020, and with that availability, the introduction of 5G handsets and devices has contributed to a renewed interest in equipment upgrades. The increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with 5G technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services. In January 2022, we began to deploy our C-band spectrum, subject to certain voluntary limitations.  In North America, our network covers over 441 million people with 4G LTE and over 285 million with 5G technology. In the United States, our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 337 million people with our LTE technology and more than 285 million people with our 5G technology.   As the wireless industry has matured, future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services on a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations. We expect to continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity, as well as obtaining additional spectrum that meets our long-term needs. We participate in FCC spectrum auctions and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support more advanced mobile internet services.  Broadband Technology In 2020, we identified fiber as a core priority for our business and enhanced our focus to expand our fiber footprint and grow customers. At December 31, 2022, we had more than 7 million fiber consumer wireline broadband customers, adding more than 1.2 million during the year. The expansion builds on our recent investments to convert to a software-based network, managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology. Software-based technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This network approach delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of next-generation technology over the traditional, hardware-intensive network approach. Our virtualized network supports next-generation applications like 5G and broadband-based services quickly and efficiently.  Latin America We believe that the wireless model in the U.S., with accelerating demand for mobile internet service and the associated economic benefits, will be repeated around the world as companies invest in high-speed mobile networks. We acquired Mexican wireless operations in 2015 to establish a seamless, cross-border North American wireless network which now covers an area with over 441 million people and businesses in the United States and Mexico. With the increased capacity from our LTE network, we also expect additional wholesale revenue in the coming years. Our 4G LTE network in Mexico now covers approximately 104 million people and businesses.   BUSINESS OPERATIONS  OPERATING SEGMENTS Our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.  Additional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading \u201cSegment Results\u201d in Item 7. and in Note 4 of Item 8.  COMMUNICATIONS Our Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our Communications services and products are marketed under the AT&T, Cricket, AT&T PREPAIDSM and AT&T Fiber brand names. The Communications segment provided approximately 97% of 2022 segment operating revenues and accounted for all of our 2022 total segment income. This segment contains the Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units.  Mobility \u2013 Our Mobility business unit provides nationwide wireless services to consumers and wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United States by utilizing our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet over wireless devices. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid, connected device or reseller. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we served 217 million Mobility subscribers, including 85 million postpaid (70 million phone), 19 million prepaid, 6 million reseller and 107 million connected devices. Our Mobility business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.  Services We offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans to meet the communications needs of targeted customer categories. Through FirstNet services, we also provide a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety.  3 3 3 AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts Consumers continue to require increasing availability of data-centric services and a network to connect and control those devices. An increasing number of our subscribers are using more advanced integrated and data-centric devices, including embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT). We offer plans that include unlimited features allowing for the sharing of voice, text and data across multiple devices, which attracts subscribers from other providers and helps minimize subscriber churn. Customers in our \u201cconnected device\u201d category (e.g., users of monitoring devices and automobile systems) generally purchase those devices from third-party suppliers that buy data access supported by our network. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and application developers to further capitalize on the continued growing demand for wireless data services.  We also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance. These services are offered under the Cricket and AT&T PREPAID brands and are typically monthly prepaid services.  Equipment We sell a wide variety of handsets, wireless data cards and wireless computing devices manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services. We also sell accessories, such as carrying cases and hands-free devices. We sell through our own company-owned stores, agents and third-party retail stores. We provide our customers the ability to purchase handsets on an installment basis and the opportunity to bring their own device. Subscribers that bring their own devices or retain handsets for longer periods impact upgrade activity. Like other wireless service providers, we also provide a limited number of postpaid contract subscribers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate, renew or upgrade service.  Business Wireline \u2013 Our Business Wireline business unit provides services to business customers, including multinational corporations, small and mid-sized businesses, governmental and wholesale customers. Our Business Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.  Services We offer advanced IP-based services, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPN), AT&T Dedicated Internet, and Ethernet as well as traditional data services, cloud solutions, outsourcing and managed professional services. We provide collaboration services that utilize our IP infrastructure and allow our customers to utilize the most advanced technology to improve their productivity. We also provide state-of-the-art security solutions like threat management and intrusion detection.  We continue to reconfigure our wireline network to take advantage of the latest technologies and services, and rely on our SDN and NFV to enhance business customers\u2019 digital agility in a rapidly evolving environment. Some of the services we have offered historically are in secular decline and going forward we will focus on our owned and operated connectivity services powered by 5G and fiber.  Equipment Equipment revenues include customer premises equipment.  Consumer Wireline \u2013 Our Consumer Wireline business unit provides broadband services, including fiber connections, and legacy telephony voice communication services to customers in the United States by utilizing our IP-based and copper wired network. Our Consumer Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: broadband, legacy voice and data services and other service and equipment.  Broadband Services We provide broadband and internet services to approximately 15 million customer locations, with 7 million fiber broadband connections at December\u00a031, 2022. With changes in video viewing preferences and the recent work and learn from home trends, we are experiencing increasing demand for high-speed broadband services. Our investment in expanding our industry-leading fiber network positions us to be a leader in wired connectivity. With our focus on fiber that brings efficiencies and owner economics, we continue to evaluate opportunities where we can turn down existing copper infrastructure.   We believe that our flexible platform with a broadband and wireless connection is the most efficient way to transport direct-to-consumer video and data experiences both at home and on mobile devices. Through this integrated approach, we can optimize the use of storage in the home as well as in the cloud, while also providing a seamless service for consumers across screens and locations.   Legacy Voice and Data Services Revenues from our traditional voice services continue to decline as customers switch to wireless or VoIP services provided by us, cable companies or other internet-based providers.  Other Services and Equipment Other service revenues include AT&T U-verse voice services (which use VoIP technology), customer fees and equipment. 4 4 4 AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts  Additional information on our Communications segment is contained in the \u201cOverview\u201d section of Item 7.  LATIN AMERICA Our Latin America segment provides wireless services in Mexico.

See Note 6  Additional information on our geographical distribution of revenues is contained in Note 4 of Item 8.   GOVERNMENT REGULATION  Facilities-based wireless communications providers in the United States, like AT&T, must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with FCC rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum. The FCC\u2019s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high-quality, innovative services our customers demand. Wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period, typically 10 to 15 years, and we must seek renewal of these licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Additionally, while wireless communications providers\u2019 prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation, the federal government and various states periodically consider new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services.  The Communications Act of 1934 and other related laws give the FCC broad authority to regulate the U.S. operations of our satellite and interstate telecommunications services. In addition, our ILEC subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments, which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access  5 5 5 AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts services, provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law. Some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings. These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers.  We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize and/or moderate regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive communications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition.  Our subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided.  For a discussion of significant regulatory issues directly affecting our operations, please see the information contained under the headings \u201cOperating Environment Overview\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Developments\u201d of Item 7, which information is incorporated herein by reference.   IMPORTANCE, DURATION AND EFFECT OF LICENSES  Certain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct business. Many of our subsidiaries also hold government-issued licenses or franchises to provide wireline or wireless services. Additional information relating to regulation affecting those rights is contained under the heading \u201cOperating Environment Overview,\u201d of Item 7. We actively pursue patents, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property within the United States and abroad. We maintain a significant global portfolio of patents, trademarks and service mark registrations. We have also entered into agreements that permit other companies, in exchange for fees and rights, and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to utilize certain of our patents, trademarks and service marks. As we transition our network from a switch-based network to an IP, software-based network, we have increasingly entered into licensing agreements with software developers.  We periodically receive offers from third parties to obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also receive notices from third parties asserting that our products or services sold to customers or software-based network functions infringe on their patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly, such as network functions, or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, such as wireless handsets, could require us to pay damages, pay royalties, stop offering the relevant products or services and/or cease network functions or other activities. While the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement claims or the expiration or non-renewal of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   MAJOR CUSTOMERS  No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020.   COMPETITION  Competition continues to increase for communications and digital services from traditional and nontraditional competitors. Technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available. In addition, lack of or a reduced level of regulation of comparable legacy services has lowered costs for alternative communications service providers. As a result, we face continuing competition as well as some new opportunities in significant portions of our business.  Wireless We face substantial competition in our wireless businesses. Under current FCC rules, multiple licensees, who provide wireless services on the cellular, PCS, Advanced Wireless Services, 700 MHz and other spectrum bands, may operate in each of our U.S. service areas. Our competitors include two national wireless providers; a larger number of regional providers and resellers of those services; and certain cable companies. In addition, we face competition from providers who offer voice, text messaging and other services as applications on data networks. We are one of three facilities-based providers in Mexico (retail and wholesale), with the most significant market share controlled by Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil. We may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other communications technologies and services. While some of these technologies and services are now operational, others are being developed or may be developed. We compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network quality, coverage area and customer service.  6 6 6 AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts Broadband The desire for high-speed data on demand, including video, is continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional wired or linear services and use our fiber services or competitors\u2019 wireless, satellite and internet-based services. In most U.S. markets, we compete for customers with large cable companies for high-speed internet and voice services, wireless broadband providers, and other smaller telecommunications companies for both long-distance and local services.  Legacy Voice and Data We continue to lose legacy voice and data subscribers due to competitors (e.g., wireless, cable and VoIP providers) who can provide comparable services at lower prices because they are not subject to traditional telephone industry regulation (or the extent of regulation they are subject to is in dispute), utilize different technologies or promote a different business model (such as advertising-based).  Additionally, we provide local and interstate telephone and switched services to other service providers, primarily large internet service providers using the largest class of nationwide internet networks (internet backbone), wireless carriers, other telephone companies, cable companies and systems integrators. These services are subject to additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies, the introduction of innovative offerings and increasing satellite, wireless, fiber-optic and cable transmission capacity for services.   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  AT&T scientists and engineers conduct research in a variety of areas, including IP networking, advanced network design and architecture, network and cyber security, network operations support systems and data analytics. The majority of the development activities are performed to create new services and to invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers. Research and development expenses were $1,236 in 2022, $1,325 in 2021, and $1,013 in 2020.  HUMAN CAPITAL  Number of Employees As of January 31, 2023, we employed approximately 160,700 persons.  Employee Development We believe our success depends on our employees\u2019 success and that all employees must have the skills they need to thrive. We offer training and elective courses that give employees the opportunity to enhance their skills. We also intend to help cultivate the next generation of talent that will lead our company into the future by providing employees with educational opportunities through our award-winning internal training organization, AT&T University.  Labor Contracts Approximately 42% of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) or other unions. After expiration of the collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached. The main contracts included the following: A contract covering approximately 7,000 Mobility employees in nine states, for which we reached tentative agreement in February 2023. A contract covering approximately 400 employees supporting internet-based products is set to expire in July 2023. A contract covering approximately 200 employees in Illinois is set to expire in May 2023.  Compensation and Benefits In addition to salaries, we provide a variety of benefit programs to help meet the needs of our employees. These programs cover active and former employees and may vary by subsidiary and region. These programs include 401(k) plans, pension benefits, and health and welfare benefits, among many others. In addition to our active employee base, at December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 506,000 retirees and dependents who were eligible to receive retiree benefits.  We review our benefit plans to maintain competitive packages that reflect the needs of our workforce. We also adapt our compensation model to provide fair and inclusive pay practices across our business. We are committed to pay equity for employees who hold the same jobs, work in the same geographic area, and have the same levels of experience and performance.  Employee Safety We provide our employees access to flexible and convenient health and welfare programs and workplace accommodations. We have prioritized self-care and emphasized a focus on wellness, providing personal protective equipment, flexible scheduling or time-off options and implementing technologies to enhance the remote-work environment.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion We believe that championing diversity and fostering inclusion does more than just make us a better company, it contributes to a world where people are empowered to be their very best. That is why we are committed to equality and why our company purpose is to connect people to greater possibilities. This focus on diversity emanates from our diverse and inclusive workforce, which is a product of our unwavering commitment to ensure that employees from any and every segment of society are treated with fairness and provided equal opportunities to advance in the company.  7 7 7 AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts AT&T Inc.Dollars in millions except per share amounts To have a diverse and inclusive workforce, we have put an emphasis on attracting and hiring talented people who represent a mix of backgrounds, identities and experiences.
