(Rockwell Automation or the Company) is the world\u2019s largest company dedicated to industrial automation and digital transformation. We understand and simplify our customers\u2019 complex production challenges and deliver the most valued solutions that combine technology and industry expertise. As a result, we make our customers more resilient, agile, and sustainable, creating more ways to win. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) for additional information on our business and long-term strategy. The Company continues the business founded as the Allen-Bradley Company in 1903. The privately-owned Allen-Bradley Company was a leading North American manufacturer of industrial automation equipment when the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC)\u00a0purchased it in 1985.  The Company was incorporated in Delaware in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December\u00a06, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, RIC contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RIC\u2019s shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC.  As used herein, the terms \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, \u201cRockwell Automation\u201d, or the \u201cCompany\u201d include wholly-owned and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise.
