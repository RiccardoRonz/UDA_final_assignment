{"cik": 1274494, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01. Business   Company Overview  We are a leading American solar technology company and global provider of photovoltaic (\u201cPV\u201d) solar energy solutions. Developed at our research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) labs in California and Ohio, we manufacture and sell PV solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology that provide a high-performance, lower-carbon alternative to conventional crystalline silicon PV solar modules. From raw material sourcing through end-of-life module recycling, we are committed to reducing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products across their life cycle. We are the world\u2019s largest thin film PV solar module manufacturer and the largest PV solar module manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere.  In addressing the overall global demand for electricity, our modules provide energy at a lower levelized cost of electricity (\u201cLCOE\u201d), meaning the net present value of a system\u2019s total life cycle costs divided by the quantity of energy that is expected to be produced over the system\u2019s life, when compared to traditional forms of energy generation. With over $1\u00a0billion in cumulative R&D investments in the last 10 years alone, we have a demonstrated history of innovation and continuous improvement. We believe our strategies and points of differentiation provide the foundation for our competitive position and enable us to remain one of the preferred providers of PV solar modules.   Business Strategy  Advanced Module Technology  Our current module semiconductor structure is a single-junction polycrystalline thin film that uses Cadmium Telluride (\u201cCdTe\u201d) as the absorption layer. CdTe has absorption properties that are well matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive wattage using approximately 2% to 3% of the amount of semiconductor material used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon modules. In terms of performance, in many climates our solar modules provide certain energy production advantages relative to competing crystalline silicon modules. For example, our CdTe solar technology provides:  \u2022a superior temperature coefficient, which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system\u2019s generation, on average, occurs when module temperatures are well above 25\u00b0C (standard test conditions); \u2022a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to standard test conditions; \u2022a better partial shading response than competing crystalline silicon technologies, which may experience significantly lower energy generation than CdTe solar technologies when partial shading occurs; and \u2022an immunity to cell cracking and its resulting power output loss, a common failure often observed in crystalline silicon modules caused by poor manufacturing, handling, weather, or other conditions.  In addition to these technological advantages, we also warrant that our solar modules will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor between 0.3% and 0.5%, depending on the module series, every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years. As a result of these and other factors, our solar modules can produce more annual energy in real world operating conditions than conventional crystalline silicon modules with the same nameplate capacity.  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents Manufacturing Process  Our modules combine our leading-edge CdTe technology with the manufacturing excellence and quality control that comes from being the world\u2019s most experienced producer of thin film PV solar modules. With more than 50\u00a0GWDC of modules sold worldwide, we have a demonstrated history of manufacturing success and innovation. Our global manufacturing footprint includes facilities in the United States, Malaysia, and Vietnam. We are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity by approximately 11 GWDC, including the construction of our third manufacturing facility in the United States, which commenced commercial production of modules in early 2023; our first manufacturing facility in India, which is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2023; our fourth manufacturing facility in the United States, which is expected to commence operations in late 2024; and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint at our existing facilities in Ohio. Our newest factory in the United States began producing and our newest factory in India is expected to produce our next generation Series 7 modules, which combine our thin film CdTe technology with a larger form factor and an innovative steel back rail mounting structure that reduces module installation time.  Our modules are manufactured in a high-throughput, automated environment that integrates all manufacturing steps into a continuous flow process. Such process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and resource-intensive batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon modules, which typically occur over several days and across multiple factories. At the outset of our module production, a sheet of glass enters the production line and in a matter of hours is transformed into a completed module ready for shipment.  This proprietary production process includes the following three stages: (i) the deposition stage, (ii) the cell definition and treatment stage, and (iii) the assembly and test stage. In the deposition stage, panels of transparent oxide-coated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned, laser-mark identified with a serial number, heated, and coated with thin layers of CdTe and other semiconductor materials using our vapor transport deposition technology, after which the semiconductor-coated plates are cooled rapidly to increase glass strength. In the cell definition and treatment stage, we use high-speed lasers to transform the large continuous semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output. In this stage, we also treat the semiconductor film using certain chemistries and processes to improve the device\u2019s performance and apply a metal sputtered back contact. In the assembly and test stage, we apply busbars, inter-layer material, and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device. We then apply anti-reflective coating material to the substrate glass to further improve the module\u2019s performance by increasing its ability to absorb sunlight. Finally, junction boxes, termination wires, and a frame are applied to complete the module assembly.  We maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and more stringent internal standards are met. We also conduct acceptance testing for electrical leakage, visual quality, and power measurement on a solar simulator prior to preparing a module for shipment. Our quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program, subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the International Electrotechnical Commission and Underwriters Laboratories Inc. These programs and tests help assure delivery of power and performance in the field with a high level of product quality and reliability.  Research and Development  Our R&D model differentiates us from much of our competition due to its vertical integration, from advanced research to product development, manufacturing, and applications. We continue to devote substantial resources to our R&D efforts, which generally focus on continually improving the wattage and energy yield of our solar modules. We also have R&D programs to improve module durability and manufacturing efficiencies, including throughput, volume ramp, and material cost reduction. We continue to invest significant financial resources in such initiatives, including approximately $0.3\u00a0billion for a dedicated R&D facility in the United States to support the  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents implementation of our technology roadmap. We expect such R&D facility to feature a high-tech pilot manufacturing line, allowing for the production of full-sized prototypes of thin film and tandem PV modules. Such R&D facility is expected to be completed in 2024. Based on publicly available information, we are one of the leaders in R&D investment among PV solar module manufacturers.  In the course of our R&D activities, we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules. We primarily conduct our R&D activities and qualify process and product improvements for full production at our Perrysburg, Ohio plant and systematically deploy them to our other facilities. We believe that our systematic approach to technology change management enables continuous improvements and ensures uniform adoption across our production lines. In addition, our production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and, as a result, a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably replicated across other production lines.  We regularly produce research cells in our laboratories, some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted to electricity in a single solar cell at standard test conditions. Our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability. Our module conversion efficiency has improved on average more than half a percent every year for the last ten years. We currently hold two world records for CdTe PV cell efficiency, achieving an independently certified research cell efficiency of 22.1% and a module aperture area efficiency of 19.7%. We continue to evaluate opportunities to develop and leverage other solar cell technologies in multi-junction applications consisting of CdTe, silicon, or other materials. We believe such applications have the potential to enable our module conversion efficiency to reach 28% by 2030.  Sustainability  We are committed to enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products and reducing our carbon footprint, even as we continue to increase our manufacturing capacity and module throughput. Our thin film modules are manufactured through an integrated process that uses less energy, water, and semiconductor material than conventional crystalline silicon modules. Accordingly, our modules provide an ecologically leading solution to address climate change, energy security, and water scarcity. On a lifecycle basis, our thin film module technology has the fastest energy payback time, smallest carbon footprint, and lowest water use of any competing PV solar technology.  The energy payback time of our module technology, which is the amount of time a module must operate to generate the energy required to produce it, is facilitated by our proprietary and resource efficient production process. Our module energy payback time is approximately four months, which represents a 90-fold energy return on investment over a theoretical 30-year system lifetime and an abundant net energy gain to the electricity grid. Furthermore, our modules have a carbon footprint that is 2.5 times lower and a water footprint that is three times lower than conventional crystalline silicon modules, measured on a lifecycle basis that accounts for the energy and water used for the raw materials, throughout our manufacturing process, and during end-of-life module recycling. In addition, our industry-leading PV solar module recycling process further enhances our sustainability advantage by recovering approximately 90% of the glass for reuse in new glass container products and over 90% of the semiconductor material for reuse in new modules. The module frame is removed and recycled for reuse in aluminum products, and in Malaysia, the recovered laminate material is reused in rubber products. We are the only PV solar module manufacturer with global in-house recycling capabilities.  Our Series 6TM (\u201cSeries 6\u201d) and Series 6 PlusTM (\u201cSeries 6 Plus\u201d) modules are the world\u2019s first and only PV products to be included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (\u201cEPEAT\u201d) Registry\u2019s Photovoltaic Modules and Inverters product category. The EPEAT Registry enables the identification of credible sustainable electronic products from a broad range of manufacturers based on several factors, including the management of substances in the product, manufacturing energy, water use, product packaging, end-of-life recycling, corporate  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents responsibility, and human rights. We have also committed to the RE100 campaign, a collaborative, global initiative of influential businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity, in which we plan to utilize renewable sources to power our manufacturing operations by 2028. We have set science-based targets to reduce our absolute direct (scope\u00a01) and indirect (scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions by 34% by 2028, from a 2020 baseline, and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. As a result of these commitments and our engagement with key suppliers to minimize the carbon footprint of our module components, we expect to reduce our module carbon footprint by more than 65% by 2028, further enabling our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives.  Financial Stability  In addition to our sustainability commitments, we are also committed to creating long-term shareholder value through a decision-making framework that delivers a balance of growth, profitability, and liquidity. This framework has enabled us to fund our module manufacturing and capacity expansion initiatives primarily using cash flows generated by our operations and by maintaining appropriate debt levels based on cash flow expectations. Our financial stability provides strategic optionality as we evaluate how to invest in our business and generate returns for our shareholders. Our financial stability also enables us to offer meaningful warranties, which provide us with a competitive advantage relative to many of our peers in the solar industry. Furthermore, we expect our financial discipline and ability to manage operating costs to enhance our profitability as we continue to scale our business.   Market Overview  Solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to and/or substitute for traditional forms of energy generation. In recent years, the cost of producing electricity from PV solar power systems has decreased to levels that are competitive with or below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets. This price decline has opened new possibilities to develop systems in many locations with limited or no financial incentives, thereby promoting the widespread adoption of solar energy. Other technological developments in the industry, such as the advancement of energy storage capabilities, have further enhanced the prospects of solar energy as an alternative to traditional forms of energy generation. In addition to these economic benefits, solar energy has substantial environmental benefits. For example, PV solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas or other emissions and use minimal amounts of water compared to traditional energy generation assets. As a result of these and other factors, worldwide solar markets continue to develop and expand.  Recently enacted government support programs, such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIRA\u201d), have contributed and are expected to continue to contribute to this momentum by providing solar module manufacturers, project developers, and project owners with tax incentives to accelerate the ongoing transition to clean energy. The provisions of the IRA are generally effective for tax years beginning after 2022 and, based on recent U.S. Treasury Department estimates, are expected to provide aggregate funding of $369 billion to address climate change, of which $270\u00a0billion is expected in the form of various tax incentives. Among other things, the IRA (i) reinstates the 30% investment tax credit for qualifying solar projects that meet certain wage and apprenticeship requirements, (ii)\u00a0extends the production tax credit (\u201cPTC\u201d) to include energy generated from solar projects, (iii) provides incremental investment and production tax credits for solar projects that meet certain domestic content and location requirements, and (iv)\u00a0offers tax credits for solar modules and solar module components manufactured in the United States and sold to third parties. In light of such regulatory developments, we have commenced certain manufacturing expansion activities and continue to evaluate opportunities for future expansion, particularly within the United States, as described below under \u201cGlobal Markets.\u201d For more information about certain risks associated with the IRA, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 We expect certain financial benefits as a result of tax incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. If these expected financial benefits vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\u201d  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Although module average selling prices in many global markets have declined for several years, recent module spot pricing has increased, in part, due to trade measures and policies, government regulations, raw material availability, and supply chain disruptions. For example, module spot pricing in the United States has increased, in part, due to elevated commodity and logistics costs and, more recently, due to the rising demand for modules manufactured in the United States as a result of the IRA described above. The duration of this elevated period of pricing is uncertain. In light of such market realities, we continue to focus on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced module technology, our manufacturing process, our R&D capabilities, the sustainability advantage of our modules, and our financial stability.   Global Markets  We have established and continue to develop a global business presence. Energy markets are, by their nature, localized, with different drivers and market forces impacting electricity generation and demand in a particular region or for a particular application. Accordingly, our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our modules can provide compelling and economically viable solutions to energy needs in various markets. We are currently focusing on markets, including those listed below, in which our CdTe solar modules provide certain advantages over conventional crystalline silicon solar modules, including high insolation climates in which our modules provide a superior temperature coefficient, humid environments in which our modules provide a superior spectral response, markets that favor the superior sustainability profile of our PV solar technology, and markets that value responsible sourcing through transparent supply chain reporting and ethical business practices. To the extent our production capacity expands in future periods, we have the potential to extend our focus to additional geographic markets.  United States. Multiple markets within the United States, which accounted for 84% of our 2022 net sales, exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market, including (i) sizeable electricity demand, particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas; (ii) strong demand for renewable energy generation; and (iii)\u00a0abundant solar resources. In those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced, our PV solar modules compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation. The market penetration of PV solar is also impacted by certain federal and state support programs described below under \u201cSupport Programs.\u201d The United States currently has an installed solar generation capacity of approximately 140 GWDC, which is expected to double by 2027 due, in part, to the economic incentives provided by the IRA. In addition, the government has established a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050. As a result of such market opportunities and renewable targets, we are in the process of expanding our U.S. manufacturing capacity by approximately 7.7\u00a0GWDC, including the construction of our third manufacturing facility in the U.S., which commenced commercial production of modules in early 2023, our fourth manufacturing facility in the U.S., which is expected to commence operations in late 2024, and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint at our existing facilities in Ohio.  India. India continues to represent one of the largest and fastest growing markets for PV solar energy with an installed generation capacity of approximately 63 GWAC, approximately 30 GWAC of projects under various stages of construction, and over 19 GWAC of new projects being contracted under active procurement programs. In addition, the government has established aggressive renewable energy targets, which include increasing the country\u2019s overall renewable energy capacity to 500 GWAC by 2030 and establishing a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2070. Based on these targets, it is projected that the installed solar energy generation capacity will be 350\u00a0GWAC by 2030. The government has also announced a series of policy and regulatory measures to incentivize domestic manufacturing of PV solar modules, as described below under \u201cSupport Programs.\u201d These targets, policies, and regulatory measures are expected to help create significant and sustained demand for PV solar energy. In addition to these factors, our CdTe solar technology is well suited for the India market given its hot and humid climate conditions. As a result of such market opportunities, we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity by an additional 3.3 GWDC by constructing our first manufacturing facility in India, which is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2023. Such expansion builds upon our existing presence of approximately 2.2\u00a0GWDC of modules sold in India.  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Europe. Most markets across Europe reflect strong demand for PV solar energy due to its ability to compete economically with more traditional forms of energy generation and, more recently, as a means to establish greater energy independence. During 2022, European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) member states added a combined 41 GWDC of solar capacity, representing the largest annual solar deployment in the region in the last 10 years. Such expansion, which was primarily driven by solar capacity additions in Germany, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, and France, brings the region\u2019s installed generation capacity to approximately 209 GWDC. We continue to pursue module sales activities in many of the countries mentioned above.   Support Programs  Although we compete in markets that do not require solar-specific government subsidies or support programs, our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the scope of tax and production incentives, renewable portfolio standards, tendering systems, and other policies or support programs intended to stimulate economies, achieve decarbonization initiatives, and/or establish greater energy independence. Such programs continue to influence the demand for PV solar energy around the world.  United States. In the United States, support programs exist at both the federal and state levels and can take the form of investment and production tax credits, sales and property tax exemptions and abatements, and/or renewable energy targets. Such incentives include the following:  \u2022Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit. In August 2022, the U.S. President signed the IRA into law, which is intended to accelerate the country\u2019s ongoing transition to clean energy. The provisions of the IRA are generally effective for tax years beginning after 2022. As discussed above, the IRA offers various tax credits, including the advanced manufacturing production credit, pursuant to Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cIRC\u201d), for solar modules and solar module components manufactured in the United States and sold to third parties. Such credit, which may be refundable or transferable to a third party, is available through 2032, subject to phase down beginning in 2030. For eligible components, the credit is equal to (i) $12 per square meter for a PV wafer, (ii) 4\u00a0cents multiplied by the capacity of a PV cell, and (iii) 7\u00a0cents multiplied by the capacity of a PV module. Such credit is expected to increase domestic manufacturing of solar modules and solar module components in the near term. For more information about certain risks associated with the benefits available to us under the IRA, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 We expect certain financial benefits as a result of tax incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. If these expected financial benefits vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\u201d For more information about pending and ongoing developments related to the IRA, see Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Certain Trends and Uncertainties.\u201d  \u2022Investment Tax Credit. At the federal level, investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980s. The current federal energy investment tax credit (\u201cITC\u201d) for solar energy property requires projects to meet certain wage and apprenticeship requirements and to have commenced construction by a certain date, which may be achieved by certain qualifying procurement activities. In 2020, the U.S. Congress extended the 26% ITC through 2022 as part of its COVID-19 relief efforts, and such credit was scheduled to step down to 22% for projects that commence construction in 2023. However, during 2022, the U.S. Congress reinstated the 30% ITC through 2032 as part of the IRA discussed above. Such credit is currently scheduled to step down to 26% for projects that commence construction in 2033, 22% for projects that commence construction in 2034, and will expire thereafter. The ITC has been an important economic driver of solar installations and qualifying procurement activities in the United States, and its extension is expected to contribute to greater long-term demand. The positive impact of the ITC depends on the availability of tax equity for project financing or the ability to transfer the ITC to other taxpayers.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022R&D grants. In July 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office announced the 2022 Solar Manufacturing Incubator Funding Opportunity, which provides up to $27 million for qualifying solar R&D projects, particularly those related to CdTe. These grants are intended to accelerate and expand domestic solar R&D to strengthen U.S. solar manufacturing and contribute to renewable energy targets. Award recipients are expected to be announced in early 2023.  \u2022Renewable portfolio standards. Many states have enacted legislation adopting Renewable Portfolio Standard (\u201cRPS\u201d) mechanisms. Under an RPS, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total retail electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible renewable resources, such as solar energy generation facilities, by a specified date. For example, California\u2019s RPS program, which is one of the most significant in the United States in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its RPS mandate, currently requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 60% of their total retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030 and 100% of such electricity demand from carbon-free resources by 2045. Some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generation facilities or other technologies. RPS mechanisms and other legislation vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state\u2019s RPS, the definition of eligible renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits qualify for RPS compliance.  India. In India, incentives at both the federal and state levels have contributed to growth in domestic PV solar module manufacturing and solar energy installations. Such incentives include the following:  \u2022Production Linked Incentive. In September 2022, the Indian government announced an expansion of the Production Linked Incentive (\u201cPLI\u201d) scheme to INR 195 billion ($2.6 billion), which is intended to promote the manufacturing of high efficiency solar modules in India and to reduce India\u2019s dependency on foreign imports of solar modules. Under the PLI scheme, manufacturers are selected through a competitive bid process and receive certain cash incentives over a five-year period following the commissioning of their manufacturing facilities. Among other things, such incentives are based on the efficiency and temperature coefficient of the modules produced, the proportion of raw materials sourced from the domestic market, the extent to which the manufacturer\u2019s operations are fully integrated within India, and the quantity of modules sold from such manufacturing operations.  \u2022Import duty tariffs. In April 2022, the Indian government began imposing import duty tariffs of 40% on solar modules and 25% on solar cells. In connection with such tariffs, the Indian government has also implemented a regulation mandating that any solar project with federal utility, state utility, or commercial and industrial off-takers that interconnects through government owned transmission lines only use solar modules from an approved list of module manufacturers, and a requirement that all federal procurement of solar modules be only from cells and modules produced domestically.  \u2022Green hydrogen targets. In January 2023, the Indian government announced its National Green Hydrogen Mission (\u201cNGHM\u201d), which is intended to make India a hub for the production and export of green hydrogen and to contribute to the broader energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The NGHM provides for an initial outlay of approximately $225 million for pilot projects and R&D, which, among other program investments, is expected to result in 5\u00a0million metric tons of annual green hydrogen production capacity and 125\u00a0GWAC of incremental renewable energy capacity, among other initiatives, by 2030. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (\u201cMNRE\u201d) will be responsible for overall coordination and implementation of the NGHM, including formulating programs for financial incentives, and other central and state government agencies will be responsible for implementing various policies, regulations, and compliance standards.  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Europe. In Europe,\u00a0renewable energy targets,\u00a0in conjunction with tenders for utility-scale PV solar and other support measures, have contributed to growth in PV solar markets.\u00a0Renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources,\u00a0while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors. Such targets and policies include the following:  \u2022REPowerEU plan. In May 2022, the European Commission set forth its REPowerEU plan, which aims to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2027. The REPowerEU plan supports the EU\u2019s rapid deployment of renewable energy sources, including solar energy, as a means to establish greater energy independence. Such plan sets forth targets for all EU member states, which includes an EU energy mix with a 45% share of energy from renewable sources by 2030. Solar targets for the same period include 300\u00a0GWAC installed by 2025 and 600 GWAC by 2030. The REPowerEU plan also aims to facilitate solar deployment through easier access to land and a framework to expedite permitting at national and local levels.  \u2022Renewable energy tenders. Certain markets in Europe, such as France, have adopted regulations for public tenders of renewable energy to prioritize PV solar power systems that utilize solar modules produced in low-carbon manufacturing processes. Such regulations require developers to provide information about the carbon footprint of PV solar modules used in their utility-scale projects and precludes the use of module technology that does not meet certain minimum carbon footprint thresholds.  Various proposed and contemplated environmental and tax policies may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy sector, including the solar energy sector, and may lead to a reduction or removal of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change.\u00a0For more information about the risks associated with these potential government actions, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, renewable energy targets, and other support for on-grid solar electricity applications, or the impact of other public policies, such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules, could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results.\u201d   Modules Business  Our primary segment is our modules business, which involves the design, manufacture, and sale of CdTe solar modules, which convert sunlight into electricity. Since the inception of First Solar, our modules have used our advanced thin film semiconductor technology. Each of our currently produced Series 6 and Series 6 Plus modules is a glass laminate approximately 4ft x 6ft in size that encapsulates thin film semiconductor materials. Our Series 7 modules, which we began producing in early 2023 at our newest manufacturing facility in the U.S. and expect to begin producing in India in the second half of 2023, are expected to have a larger form factor of approximately 4ft x 7ft in size. At the end of 2022, our modules had an average power output of 467 watts.  Raw Materials  Our module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a solar module, including CdTe, front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide, other semiconductor materials, organics such as photo resist, tempered back glass, frames, packaging components such as interlayer, cord plate/cord plate cap, lead wire, and solar connectors. Before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process, a supplier must undergo rigorous qualification procedures, and we continually evaluate new suppliers as part of our cost reduction roadmap and expansion activities. When possible, we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations, reducing the cost and lead times for such materials. For more information about the risks associated with our supply chain, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Several of our key raw materials and components are either single-sourced or sourced from a limited number of  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents suppliers, and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us.\u201d  Customers  Our customers include developers and operators of systems, utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners. During 2022, our third-party module sales represented approximately 93% of our total net sales, and we sold the majority of our solar modules to developers and operators of systems in the United States. During 2022, Intersect Power, Lightsource BP, and NextEra Energy each accounted for more than 10% of our modules business net sales. For more information about risks related to our customers, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 The loss of any of our large customers, or the inability of our customers and counterparties to perform under their contracts with us, could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our results of operations.  We continue to focus on certain key geographic markets, particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand, and additional customer relationships to diversify our customer base. The wholesale commercial and industrial market continues to represent a promising opportunity for the widespread adoption of PV solar technology as corporations undertake certain sustainability commitments. The demand for corporate renewables continues to accelerate, with corporations worldwide committing to the RE100 campaign. We believe we also have a competitive advantage in the commercial and industrial market due to many customers\u2019 sensitivity to the sustainability, experience, and financial stability of their suppliers and geographically diverse operating locations. With our sustainability advantage, financial strength, and global footprint, we are well positioned to meet these needs.  Additionally, the increase of utility-owned generation has expanded the number of potential buyers of our modules as such utility customers benefit from a potentially low cost of capital available through rate-based utility investments. Given their long-term ownership profile, utility-owned generation customers typically seek to partner with stable companies that can provide low-cost alternatives to or replacements for aging fossil fuel-based generation resources, including reliable PV solar technology, thereby mitigating their long-term ownership risks.  Competition  The solar energy and renewable energy sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry. Among PV solar module manufacturers, the principal method of competition is sales price per watt, which may be influenced by several module value attributes, including wattage (through a larger form factor or an improved conversion efficiency), energy yield, degradation, sustainability, and reliability. Sales price per watt may also be influenced by warranty terms and customer payment terms. We face intense competition for sales of solar modules, which may result in reduced selling prices and loss of market share. Our primary source of competition is crystalline silicon module manufacturers, the majority of which are linked to China. Allegations of forced labor in the Chinese solar supply chain have emerged in recent years, which means we also compete on our approach to responsible sourcing and supply chain due diligence. Our differentiated technology, integrated manufacturing process, and tightly controlled supply chain helps limit the risks associated with outsourcing and the multiple supply tiers of conventional crystalline silicon module manufacturing.  We also expect to compete with future entrants into the PV solar industry and existing market participants that offer new or differentiated technological solutions. For additional information, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved PV products, including as a result of delays in implementing planned advancements, could render our solar modules uncompetitive and reduce our net sales, profitability, and/or market share.\u201d  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents Certain of our existing or future competitors, including many linked to China, may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital or other forms of state support, which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if competitors reduce module pricing to levels below their costs, bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time. We believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand, which could lead to periods of pricing volatility. For additional information, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time. The solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between global PV module supply and demand that result in periods of pricing volatility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\u201d  Solar Module Warranties  We provide a limited PV solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12.5 years. We also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years. Among other things, our solar module warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking. For additional information on our solar module warranty programs, refer to Item\u00a01A.\u00a0\u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant and/or unexpected contractual damages and/or warranty and related expenses, damage our market reputation, and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share.\u201d  Solar Module Collection and Recycling  We are committed to mitigating the environmental impact of our products over their entire life cycle. As part of such efforts, we offer recycling services to help module owners meet their end-of-life (\u201cEOL\u201d) obligations. In 2005, we voluntarily established the industry\u2019s first global and comprehensive module collection and recycling program, and in 2013 we implemented a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d recycling service. We continue to invest in module recycling technology improvements to increase recycling efficiency and reduce recycling prices for our customers. Our module recycling process is designed to maximize the recovery of materials, including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material, for use in new modules or other products and enhances the sustainability profile of our modules. Approximately 90% of each collected First Solar module can be recycled into materials for reuse. We currently operate recycling facilities at our manufacturing sites in the United States, Malaysia, and Vietnam and at our former manufacturing facility in Germany.  For certain legacy customer sales contracts that were covered under the 2005 module collection and recycling program, which has since been discontinued, we agreed to pay the costs for the collection and recycling of qualifying solar modules, and the end users agreed to notify us, disassemble their solar power systems, package the solar modules for shipment, and revert ownership rights over the modules back to us at the end of the modules\u2019 service lives.  For modules covered under our program that were previously sold into and installed in the EU, we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program. The EU\u2019s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cWEEE\u201d) Directive places the obligation of recycling (including collection, treatment, and environmentally sound disposal) of electrical and electronic equipment products upon producers and is applicable to all PV solar modules in EU member states. As a result of the transposition of the WEEE Directive by the EU member states, we have adjusted our recycling offerings, as required, to ensure compliance with specific EU member state WEEE regulations.  12 12 12  Table of Contents Table of Contents Intellectual Property  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as associate and third-party confidentiality agreements, to safeguard our intellectual property. We regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our R&D activities in the United States and other countries. Our patent applications and any future patent applications may not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, or at all, and any patents we may receive may be challenged, invalidated, or declared unenforceable. In addition, we have registered and/or have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries for \u201cFirst Solar.\u201d  With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on, among other things, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our PV solar module manufacturing processes, including our unique materials sourcing, involve proprietary know-how, technology, or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, equipment designs, algorithms, and procedures. We have taken security measures to protect these elements. Our R&D personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates, to the extent permitted by law, to assign to us all of the inventions, designs, and technologies they develop during the course of their employment with us that are directed towards our actual or anticipated business. We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose sensitive aspects of our modules, technology, or business plans.   Regulatory, Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters  We are subject to various federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations, and are often subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes, safety, and other matters. The impact of these laws and requirements may increase our overall costs and may delay, prevent, or increase the cost of manufacturing PV modules. As we operate in the U.S. and internationally, we are also subject to the application of U.S. trade laws and trade laws of other countries. Such tariffs and policies, or any other U.S. or global trade remedies or other trade barriers that apply to us given our global operations, may directly or indirectly affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Existing regulations and policies, changes thereto, and new regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of PV solar products, which may significantly reduce demand for our modules.\u201d  We are also subject to the application of various anti-bribery laws, some of which prohibit improper payments to government and non-government persons and entities, and others (e.g., the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Bribery Act) that extend their application to activities outside their country of origin. From time to time, we may compete against companies for contracts in China, India, South America, and the Middle East, which require substantial government contact and where norms can differ from U.S. standards, and not all competitors are subject to compliance with the same anti-bribery laws. See Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 \u201cWe could be adversely affected by any violations of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreign anti-bribery laws.\u201d  We are also subject to various federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the use, management, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes; occupational health and safety; and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Our operations include the use, handling, storage, transportation, generation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from third-party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or non-compliance with environmental permits required for our operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future. However, future developments such as the implementation of new, more stringent laws and regulations, more aggressive enforcement policies, or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. See Item\u00a01A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\u201d  From time to time, we may also be subject to government policies or laws intended to protect human rights. For example, in late 2021 the U.S. President signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans the import of goods from China\u2019s Xinjiang region into the United States due to concerns about forced labor practices in the region, which provides approximately half of the world\u2019s polysilicon supply. While we do not use polysilicon in our solar modules, which mitigates the potential supply chain disruptions and human rights risks associated with such import ban, the implementation of similar restrictions or trade embargoes on the purchase of certain materials or equipment necessary to sustain our manufacturing operations may require expenditures and process changes to ensure our supply chain remains free of such materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We are committed to protecting human rights, enforcing fair labor practices, and addressing the potential risks of forced labor across our own operations and the operations of our suppliers.   Human Capital  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 5,500 associates (our term for full and part-time employees), including approximately 4,700 in our modules business that work primarily in the United States, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The remainder of our associates are in R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative positions.  Our company\u2019s success depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, train, and retain management, operations, sales, and technical talent, including associates in foreign jurisdictions. We strive to attract, hire, and retain qualified individuals globally to further our mission of providing cost-advantaged solar technology through rigorous safety practices, innovation, customer engagement, industry leadership, and operational excellence. We take a consciously inclusive approach to our hiring practices, which we monitor through a review of applicant and new-hire metrics on a quarterly basis. We prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. As part of our global talent management process, we engage in succession planning by prioritizing the development and retention of associates in critical roles.  We follow a pay-for-performance model in which associates are compensated for achieving goals and associated metrics and demonstrating First Solar values. We review associate compensation on a regular basis to ensure internal and external equity, including, among other things, minimum wage and living wage assessments across our global operations. We offer competitive compensation and benefits to our associates, including, for example, health care and other insurance benefits, retirement programs, paid time off, paid parental leave, flexible work schedules, and education assistance, depending on eligibility.  We are committed to developing and providing career growth opportunities for our associates. We believe a strong culture of inclusiveness is essential to the success of our company. We gather and respond to associate feedback in a variety of ways, including through anonymous, periodic associate engagement and inclusion surveys, pulse surveys, and one-on-one interactions. Additionally, we support career advancement, mentorship, and leadership development programs to ensure the professional growth of our diverse talent.  None of our associates are currently represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. As we continue to expand domestically and internationally, we may encounter regional laws that mandate union representation or associates who desire union representation or a collective bargaining agreement. We recognize that  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents in the locations where we operate, employees have the right to freely associate or not associate with third-party labor organizations, along with the right to bargain or not to bargain collectively in accordance with local laws.
