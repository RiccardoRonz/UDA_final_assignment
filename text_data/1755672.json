The company's broad portfolio of agriculture solutions fuels farmer productivity in approximately 140 countries. See Note 21 - Geographic Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the location of the company's sales and property.   On June 1, 2019, Corteva, Inc. became an independent, publicly traded company through the completed separation (the \u201cSeparation\u201d) of the agriculture business of DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (formerly known as DowDuPont Inc.) (\u201cDuPont\u201d or \"DowDuPont\"). The Separation was effectuated through a pro rata distribution (the \u201cCorteva Distribution\u201d) of all of the then- issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Corteva, Inc.   As a result of the Internal Reorganization (defined below), on May 31, 2019, EIDP was contributed to Corteva, Inc. and, as a result, Corteva, Inc. owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of EIDP. Shares of EIDP preferred stock, $3.50 Series and $4.50 Series, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Separation remain issued and outstanding and were unaffected by the Separation. EIDP is a subsidiary of Corteva, Inc. and continues to be a reporting company, subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Prior to March 31, 2019, Corteva, Inc. had engaged in no business operations and had no assets or liabilities of any kind, other than those incident to its formation.  Internal Reorganizations and Business Separations Subsequent to the Merger, Historical Dow and EIDP engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps to realign their businesses into three subgroups: agriculture, materials science and specialty products (\"Internal Reorganization\"). On April 1, 2019, DowDuPont completed the separation of its materials science business into a separate and independent public company by way of a distribution of Dow common stock, to holders of DowDuPont's common stock (the \u201cDow Distribution\u201d and together with the Corteva Distribution, the \u201cDistributions\u201d).  On April 1, 2019, Historical Dow entities, which held certain assets and liabilities aligned with Historical Dow\u2019s agriculture business and the assets and liabilities associated with its specialty products business, respectively, were transferred and conveyed to DowDuPont.   3  3  3 Table Of ContentsPart\u00a0IITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS, continued Table Of Contents Part\u00a0I ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS, continued  On April 1, 2019 and May 1, 2019, EIDP\u2019s materials science and specialty products entities, along with their respective assets and liabilities, were conveyed to Dow and DowDuPont, respectively. On May 2, 2019, DowDuPont conveyed Historical Dow agricultural entities to EIDP.   On May 6, 2019, the Board of Directors of DowDuPont approved the distribution of all the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Corteva, Inc., then a wholly-owned subsidiary of DowDuPont, to DowDuPont stockholders. On May 31, 2019, DowDuPont contributed EIDP to Corteva, Inc. and on June 1, 2019, the Separation was completed. Corteva, Inc.'s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"CTVA\" on June 3, 2019.  Separation Agreements In connection with the Distributions, DuPont, Corteva, and Dow (together, the \u201cParties\u201d and each a \u201cParty\u201d) have entered into certain agreements to effect the separation, provide for the allocation of DowDuPont\u2019s assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including its investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) among the Parties, and provide a framework for Corteva's relationship with Dow and DuPont following the separations and Distributions.

Boswell Company to purchase the remaining 46.5 percent interest in PhytoGen\u00ae Seed Company, LLC \u2013 a joint venture between the two companies. With a 100% ownership position in PhytoGen\u00ae Seed Company, LLC, Corteva became the sole owner of the intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, proprietary germplasm and information, as well as know-how.  In connection with the validation of breeding plans and large-scale product development timelines focused on rapidly ramping up differentiated technology solutions, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company began accelerating the ramp up of the Enlist E3TM trait platform in the company\u2019s soybean portfolio mix across all brands, including Pioneer\u00ae brands, over the subsequent five years. During the ramp-up period, the company began to significantly reduce the volume of products with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield\u00ae and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend\u00ae herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021, with expected minimal use of the Roundup Ready 2 Yield\u00ae and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend\u00ae traits thereafter for the remaining term of the non-exclusive license with the Monsanto Company. Refer to Prepaid Royalties within the Critical Accounting Estimates section on page 55 for additional information.  Distribution The seed segment has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the company\u2019s brands to customers, primarily through the company\u2019s multi-channel, multi-brand strategy, which includes four differentiated channels: Pioneer agency model, regional brands, retail brands, as well as third parties through licensing and distribution channels.  The Pioneer agency model is unique to Corteva and represents sales made directly to farmers via independent sales representatives. Through this agency model, the company interacts directly with farmers at multiple points in the growing season, from prior to planting all the way through harvest. These regular interactions enable the company to provide the advice and service farmers need while giving the company real-time insights into the customers\u2019 future ordering decisions. The company\u2019s regional brands connect to customers through regional brand employees and farmer-dealer networks. Retail brands provide a one-stop shop for seed and chemistry solutions and may include sales to distributors, agricultural cooperatives, and dealers. Finally, Corteva out-licenses traits and germplasm to third parties.  Key Raw Materials The key raw materials for seed include corn and soybean seeds. To produce high-quality seeds, the company contracts with third-party growers globally. Corteva focuses on production close to the customer to provide the seed product, which is suitable for that region and its weed, insect and disease challenges, weather, soil and other conditions. The company conditions and packages the seeds using its own plants and third-party contract manufacturers. By striking a balance between owning production facility assets directly and contracting with third-party growers, the company believes it is best able to maintain flexibility to react to demand changes unique to each geography while minimizing costs. The company seeks to collaborate with strategic seed growers and share its digital agronomy and product management knowledge with them. The company\u2019s third-party growers are an important part of its supply chain. Corteva provides them with rigorous training, planning tools and access to a system that tests and advances products matched to specific geographic needs.  The seed segment's R&D and supply chain groups work seamlessly to select and maintain product characteristics that enhance the quality of its seed products and solutions. Corteva focuses on customer-driven innovation to deliver superior germplasm and trait technologies. With its large sets of digitized data and its seed field management solution, the company can manage its field operations efficiently and draw insights from data quickly and effectively. This allows the company\u2019s supply chain to react quickly to changing customer needs and provides R&D with tremendous amounts of data to analyze and incorporate into resource allocation decisions. The company continues to invest in and build capabilities that drive value via data digitization and analytics that enable it to create an even more responsive and efficient answer to customer needs.  Crop Protection The crop protection segment serves the global agricultural input industry with products that protect against weeds, insects and other pests, and disease, and that improve overall crop health both above and below ground via nitrogen management and seed-applied technologies. The segment's crop protection solutions and digital solutions provide farmers the tools they need to improve productivity and profitability, and help keep fields free of weeds, insects and diseases. The company is a leader in global herbicides, insecticides, nitrogen stabilizers and pasture and range management herbicides.   6  6  6 Table Of ContentsPart\u00a0IITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS, continued Table Of Contents Part\u00a0I ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS, continued  A summary of the crop protection segment\u2019s net sales by major product line and geographic region (based on customer location) are as follows:   Products and Brands  The crop protection segment\u2019s major brands and technologies, by key product line, are listed below: Insect and Nematode ManagementCLOSER\u2122; DELEGATE\u00ae; INTREPID\u00ae; ISOCLAST\u2122; EXALT\u2122; PEXALON\u2122; TRANSFORM\u2122; VYDATE\u00ae; OPTIMUM\u00ae; Reklemel\u2122; SALIBRO\u2122; PYRAXALT\u2122; QALCOVA\u2122; JEMVELVA\u2122; RADIANT\u2122; SENTRICON\u00ae; ENTRUST\u00ae SC; GF-120\u2122; and TRACER\u2122Disease ManagementAPROACH PRIMA\u00ae; VESSARYA\u00ae; APROACH\u00ae, APROACH POWER\u00ae; VIOVAN\u2122; TALENDO\u2122; VERBEN\u2122, EQUATION PRO\u00ae; EQUATION CONTACT\u00ae; ZORVEC\u2122; INATREQ\u2122; CURZATE\u2122; TANOS\u00ae, BIM MAX\u00ae; BEAM\u00ae; FONTELIS\u2122; DITHANE; ACANTO\u2122; GALILEO\u00ae, VERPIXO; and ZETIGO PRMWeed ControlARIGO\u00ae; ARYLEX\u2122; ENLIST\u2122 weed control system; ENLIST ONE\u2122; BROADWAY\u2122; RINSKOR\u2122; ZYPAR\u2122; MUSTANG\u2122; GALLANT\u2122; VERDICT\u00ae; LANCET\u00ae; KERB\u2122; PIXXARO\u00ae; QUELEX\u2122; GALLERY\u00ae; CENT-7\u00ae; SNAPSHOT\u00ae; TRELLIS\u00ae; CITADEL\u2122; CLIPPER\u2122; GRANITE\u00ae; RAINBOW\u2122; PINDAR\u00ae GT; VIPER\u00ae; BELKAR\u00ae; WIDEMATCH\u00ae; PERFECTMATCH\u00ae; CLINCHER\u2122; FENCER\u00ae; GARLON\u2122; SONIC\u00ae; TEXARO\u00ae; KEYSTONE\u00ae; PACTO\u00ae; LIGATE\u00ae; DIMENSION\u00ae;  TOPSHOT\u2122; RICER\u2122; LOYANT\u2122; AGIXA\u00ae, NOVIXID\u00ae, NOVLECT\u2122; REALM\u00ae Q; TRIVENCE\u00ae; LONTREL\u00ae; GRAZON\u00ae; PAXEO\u00ae, PRIMUS\u00ae; RESICORE\u2122; SPIDER\u00ae; STARANE\u00ae; SURESTART\u2122; and TORDON\u00aeNitrogen ManagementINSTINCT\u00ae; N-SERVE\u00ae Nitrogen StabilizerOtherLANDVisor\u2122 CLOSER\u2122; DELEGATE\u00ae; INTREPID\u00ae; ISOCLAST\u2122; EXALT\u2122; PEXALON\u2122; TRANSFORM\u2122; VYDATE\u00ae; OPTIMUM\u00ae; Reklemel\u2122; SALIBRO\u2122; PYRAXALT\u2122; QALCOVA\u2122; JEMVELVA\u2122; RADIANT\u2122; SENTRICON\u00ae; ENTRUST\u00ae SC; GF-120\u2122; and TRACER\u2122 APROACH PRIMA\u00ae; VESSARYA\u00ae; APROACH\u00ae, APROACH POWER\u00ae; VIOVAN\u2122; TALENDO\u2122; VERBEN\u2122, EQUATION PRO\u00ae; EQUATION CONTACT\u00ae; ZORVEC\u2122; INATREQ\u2122; CURZATE\u2122; TANOS\u00ae, BIM MAX\u00ae; BEAM\u00ae; FONTELIS\u2122; DITHANE; ACANTO\u2122; GALILEO\u00ae, VERPIXO; and ZETIGO PRM ARIGO\u00ae; ARYLEX\u2122; ENLIST\u2122 weed control system; ENLIST ONE\u2122; BROADWAY\u2122; RINSKOR\u2122; ZYPAR\u2122; MUSTANG\u2122; GALLANT\u2122; VERDICT\u00ae; LANCET\u00ae; KERB\u2122; PIXXARO\u00ae; QUELEX\u2122; GALLERY\u00ae; CENT-7\u00ae; SNAPSHOT\u00ae; TRELLIS\u00ae; CITADEL\u2122; CLIPPER\u2122; GRANITE\u00ae; RAINBOW\u2122; PINDAR\u00ae GT; VIPER\u00ae; BELKAR\u00ae; WIDEMATCH\u00ae; PERFECTMATCH\u00ae; CLINCHER\u2122; FENCER\u00ae; GARLON\u2122; SONIC\u00ae; TEXARO\u00ae; KEYSTONE\u00ae; PACTO\u00ae; LIGATE\u00ae; DIMENSION\u00ae;  TOPSHOT\u2122; RICER\u2122; LOYANT\u2122; AGIXA\u00ae, NOVIXID\u00ae, NOVLECT\u2122; REALM\u00ae Q; TRIVENCE\u00ae; LONTREL\u00ae; GRAZON\u00ae; PAXEO\u00ae, PRIMUS\u00ae; RESICORE\u2122; SPIDER\u00ae; STARANE\u00ae; SURESTART\u2122; and TORDON\u00ae INSTINCT\u00ae; N-SERVE\u00ae Nitrogen Stabilizer LANDVisor\u2122  Key Raw Materials The key raw materials and supplies for crop protection include chlorinated pyridines derivatives, specialty intermediates and technical grade active ingredients, chlorine, and seed treatments. Typically, the company purchases major raw materials through long-term contracts with multiple suppliers, which sometimes require minimum purchase commitments. Certain important raw materials are supplied by a few major suppliers. The company expects the markets for its raw materials to remain balanced, though pricing may be volatile given global economic conditions. The company relies on contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain inputs or key components for its product formulations. These inputs are typically sourced close to where the company ultimately formulates and sells its products. Shifts in customer demand, reduced local availability of raw materials, and/or production capacity constraints may, at times, necessitate sourcing from an alternative geography. The company strives to maintain multiple high-quality supply sources for each input.  Corteva\u2019s supply chain strategy involves managing global supplies of active and intermediate ingredients sourced regionally with global best practices and oversight. Corteva\u2019s supply strategy includes a robust and flexible global footprint to meet future   7  7  7 Table Of ContentsPart\u00a0IITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS, continued Table Of Contents Part\u00a0I ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS, continued  portfolio growth. The company\u2019s supply chain also provides competitive advantages including reducing time to meet customer requirements in regions while minimizing costs through the value chain.  Seasonality Corteva\u2019s sales are generally strongest in the first half of the calendar year, which aligns with the planting and growing season in the northern hemisphere. The company typically generates about 65 percent of its sales in the first half of the calendar year, driven by northern hemisphere seed and crop protection sales. The company generates about 35 percent of its sales in the second half of the calendar year, led by seed sales in the southern hemisphere. The seasonality in sales impacts both the seed and crop protection segments. The company\u2019s direct distribution channel, where products are shipped to farmers, is more affected by planting delays than its competitors. Generally speaking, unfavorable weather slows the planting season and can affect the company\u2019s quarterly results and sales mix. Severe unfavorable weather, however, can impact overall sales. Accounts receivable tends to be higher during the first half of the year, consistent with the peak sales period in the northern hemisphere, with cash collection focused in the fourth quarter.  Human Capital Management Corteva aims to attract the best employees, to retain those employees through offering career development and training opportunities while also prioritizing their safety and wellness in an inclusive and productive work environment. The company\u2019s strong employee base of approximately 21,000 employees, along with its commitment to Corteva\u2019s core values, is a key element to the success of its business.  Workforce Composition.  As of December 31, 2022, the company globally employs approximately 21,000 employees. In order to address regional specific customer needs within its global business, the company has a geographically diverse employee base with 49%, 20%, 18%, and 13% located in North America, EMEA, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific regions, respectively.   Approximately 1% of the workforce is unionized in the United States and another 11% participate in work councils and collective bargaining arrangements outside the United States. In 2022, the company did not experience any work stoppages due to strike or lockouts.  Safety.  Living safely is one of the company\u2019s core values by which the company manages its business. The company has implemented safety programs and management practices to promote a culture of safety to protect its employees, as well as the environment. This includes required trainings for employees, as well as specific qualifications and certifications for certain operational employees.   Diversity.  The company has a robust inclusion, diversity, and equity (\u201cID&E\u201d) vision and strategy, based upon the belief that embracing diversity and inclusion benefits the company by creating a workforce with a greater variety of skills and perspectives as a result of their differentiated backgrounds and experiences. Specific ID&E initiatives are identified and tracked to create a culture of belonging where a diverse population of employees are attracted, retained, and engaged. Management is expected to support specific diversity initiatives for their respective geographies and business, as applicable, in order to build a more representative workforce. Critical to creating this environment are company-sponsored employee business resource groups (\u201cBRGs\u201d) that support and promote certain mutual objectives of both the employee and the company, including community engagement and the professional development of employees. The BRGs provide a space where employees can foster connections within a supportive environment. The company maintains nine global BRGs, each led by a member of the company\u2019s senior leadership: Disability Awareness Network; Global African Heritage Alliance; Global Indigenous Peoples Alliance; Growing Asian Impact Network; Latin Network; Pride (LGBTQ+); Professional Learning Acceleration Network; Veteran\u2019s Network; and Women\u2019s Inclusion Network.   The company monitors gender and racial representation as part of its recruitment and talent development processes, in order to ensure equitable processes and to build a more representative leadership pipeline. The company reviews its diversity and inclusion efforts through periodic engagement surveys and other measures. The results of the company\u2019s efforts, along with its ID&E strategy, are reviewed periodically with the company\u2019s management, and through no less than annual reviews of the company\u2019s leadership pipelines with the People and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.   Experienced Management.  The company believes its management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute its strategy and advance its product pipelines and technology. The company's chief executive officer and business presidents have an average of approximately 24 years of agriculture experience and are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding its position as a global force in the agriculture industry.   8  8  8 Table Of ContentsPart\u00a0IITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS, continued Table Of Contents Part\u00a0I ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS, continued   Intellectual Property Corteva considers its intellectual property estate, which includes patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, in the aggregate, to constitute a valuable asset of Corteva and actively seeks to secure intellectual property rights as part of an overall strategy to protect its investment in innovations and maximize the results of its research and development program. While the company believes that its intellectual property estate, taken as a whole, provides a competitive advantage in many of its businesses, no single patent, trademark, license or group of related patents or licenses is in itself essential to the company as a whole or to any of the company\u2019s segments.  Trade secrets are an important element of the company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make Corteva products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. Corteva vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets. When the company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, the company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the company and/or unjust enrichment.  Patents & Trademarks:\u00a0Corteva\u00a0continually applies for and obtains U.S. and foreign patents and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. Corteva\u2019s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company in the aggregate. The protection afforded by these patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. This significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the company\u2019s strategic priorities within and across product lines. At December 31, 2022, the company owned about 5,900 U.S. patents and about 11,300 active patents outside of the U.S.   Remaining life of granted patents owned as of December 31, 2022: Approximate U.S.Approximate Other CountriesWithin 5 years8001,6006 to 10 years1,9004,40011 to 15 years2,5005,10016 to 20 years700200Total5,90011,300  In addition to its owned patents, the company owns over 5,200 patent applications.  The company also owns or has licensed a substantial number of trade names, trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and other countries, including approximately 12,000 registrations and pending trademark applications in a number of jurisdictions.  In addition, the company holds multiple long-term biotechnology trait licenses from third parties in the normal course of business. Most corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits licensed from third parties under these long-term licenses.  Competition The company competes with producers of seed germplasm, trait developers, and crop protection products on a global basis. The global market for products within the industry is highly competitive and the company believes competition has and will continue to intensify. Corteva competes based on germplasm and trait leadership, price, quality and cost competitiveness and the offering of a holistic solution. The company\u2019s key competitors include BASF, Bayer, FMC, Syngenta and ChemChina, as well as companies trading in generic crop protection chemicals and regional seed companies.

We evaluate and test products throughout the research and development phases, and each new technology undergoes further rigorous scientific studies and tests to validate that the product can be used effectively and that use of the technology is safe for humans and animals and does not cause undue harm to the environment when used in accordance with the directions for use.  The regulatory approval processes and procedures globally are becoming increasingly more complex, which has resulted in additional testing needs, difficult to predict and longer approval timelines, and higher development and maintenance costs. We continue to invest on an ongoing basis to keep dossiers current, respond to regulators and meet evolving regulatory standards required by global regulatory frameworks. Failure to comply with these regulations or future regulatory bans and requirements related to our products and their use may materially impact our financial performance. The increase in timelines for regulatory approvals may result in the company not achieving its sustainability targets, or its anticipated returns on research and development investments.  Regulation of Genetically Modified Organisms (\u201cGMOs\u201d) Genetically modified seed products are subject to regulatory approval processes and procedures. For example, in the United States, the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology governs genetically modified organisms, using existing U.S. legislation and legal authorities on food, feed and environmental safety. Plant GMOs are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (the \u201cUSDA\u201d) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (the \u201cAPHIS\u201d) under the Plant Protection Act. The APHIS assesses the trait to ensure that the trait will not pose a plant pest and is not a noxious weed. GMOs in food are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFFDCA\u201d). The FDA ensures that the food is safe for food and feed. Pesticides and microorganisms containing GMOs are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (the \u201cFIFRA\u201d) and the Toxic Substances Control Act. The EPA assesses the trait or the stack containing the traits to ensure that there is no unreasonable adverse effect to the environment.  Other countries also have rigorous approval processes, procedures, and scientific testing requirements for the cultivation or import of genetically modified seed products. In the United States and other countries that have functioning regulatory systems, a rigorous scientific review is conducted by these agencies to demonstrate that genetically modified products are as safe as traditionally bred, non-biotech/GMO counterparts for food, feed and the environment. Various countries in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia have banned GMOs entirely.  Regulation of Crop Protection Products Globally, manufacturers of crop protection products, including herbicides, fungicides and insecticides are required to submit an application/dossier and obtain government regulatory approval prior to selling products in a particular country. In the United States, the EPA is responsible for registering and overseeing the approval and marketing of pesticides, pursuant to the FIFRA, the FFDCA and the Food Quality Protection Act. Also, the USDA and the FDA monitor levels of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops. Already registered pesticides are required to be re-registered every 15 years to ensure that those products continue to meet the rigorous safety standards set by the regulators. The EPA reevaluates pesticide tolerances at least every 10 years, taking into account ecological and human health risks, in addition to cumulative risks as a result of multiple routes of and sources of exposure.  As of January 2022, before registering any new conventional pesticide active ingredient, the EPA will evaluate the potential effects on listed species and their designated critical habitats under the Endangered Species Act (the \u201cESA\u201d). EPA also has initiated such evaluations for certain other active ingredients in response to existing or threatened litigation. Where the EPA determines that a pesticide in the registration and re-evaluation processes \u201cmay affect\u201d a listed species, the EPA must consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. As part of its approval, registration, and reevaluation processes, the EPA may impose certain use restrictions on crop protection products under the ESA. Under the citizen suit provisions, the ESA also includes citizen suit provisions that allow the public to bring suit in court against federal agencies when they believe a listed species is not being adequately protected by the EPA.  The company's European operations are subject to the European chemical regulation REACH (\u201cRegistration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals\u201d) and the CLP (\u201cClassification, Labeling, and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures\u201d). Other jurisdictions also have rigorous approval processes, procedures and scientific testing requirements for the   10  10  10 Table Of ContentsPart\u00a0IITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS, continued Table Of Contents Part\u00a0I ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS, continued  approval of crop protection products. We continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments related to pollution and other environmental health and safety matters.  European Farm to Fork Strategy In October 2021, a majority of the European Parliament adopted the Farm to Fork Strategy setting forth the European Union\u2019s plans to increase organic farming. As part of this strategy, the E.U. Commission has set aggressive 2030 targets to reduce by 50% the use and risk of chemical pesticides and the use of more hazardous pesticides by 50%. Additionally, as part of this strategy, the E.U. Commission is targeting having 25% of the European Union\u2019s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030. The E.U. Commission is also expected to propose mandatory front-of-pack nutrition labelling and develop a food labelling framework covering the nutritional, climate, environmental and social aspects of food products. While the company has a growing product portfolio supportive to organic agriculture, the implementation of this strategy may decrease the size of the market for its products within the European Union.
