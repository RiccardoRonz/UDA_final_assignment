We bring sustainable and efficient solutions to buildings, homes and transportation through our strategic brands, Trane\u00ae and Thermo King\u00ae, and our environmentally responsible portfolio of products, services and connected intelligent controls. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sales and service of solutions for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), transport refrigeration, and custom refrigeration solutions. As an industry leader with an extensive global install base, our growth strategy includes expanding recurring revenue through services and rental options. Our unique business operating system, uplifting culture and highly engaged team around the world are also central to our earnings and cash flow growth. Through our sustainability-focused strategy and purpose to boldly challenge what\u2019s possible for a sustainable world, we meet critical needs and growing global demand for innovation that reduces greenhouse gas emissions while enabling healthier, efficient indoor environments and safe, reliable delivery of essential temperature-controlled cargo. We have announced certain defined sustainability commitments with a goal of achieving these commitments by 2030 (2030 Sustainability Commitments). Trane Technologies\u2019 bold 2030 Sustainability Commitments have been verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and include our \u2018Gigaton Challenge\u2019 to reduce customer greenhouse gas emissions by a billion metric tons, \u2018Leading by Example\u2019 through carbon-neutral operations across our own footprint, and \u2018Opportunity for All\u2019 by building a diverse workforce reflective of our communities.

Competitive Conditions Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served, we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services. They include well-established regional or specialized competitors, as well as larger U.S. and non-U.S. corporations or divisions of larger companies. The principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price, quality, delivery, service and support, technology and innovation. We are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of HVAC systems and services and transport temperature control products and services. Distribution Our products are distributed by a number of methods, which we believe are appropriate to the type of product. U.S. sales are made through branch sales offices, distributors and dealers across the country. Non-U.S. sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world. Operations by Geographic Area Approximately 28% of our net revenues in 2022 were derived outside the U.S. and we sold products in approximately 100 countries. Therefore, the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country, such as currency devaluation, nationalization and establishment of common markets, may have an adverse impact on our non-U.S. operations.  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Customers We have no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020. No material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers; therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. Materials We both manufacture and procure many of the components included in our products.  For components we manufacture, we are required to source a wide variety of commodities such as steel, copper, and aluminum.  These principal commodities are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world, primarily within the region where the products are manufactured. We believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future.  For many components we procure, we have multiple capable sources with minimal concerns for sufficient supply, however there are certain categories of components that continue to see limited availability or shortages. Seasonality Demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions. For instance, sales in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses historically tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents spring and summer in the U.S. and other northern hemisphere markets, which are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services. Therefore, results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could positively or negatively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations. Research and Development We engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products, enhance existing product effectiveness, improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate. In 2022, we spent $211.2\u00a0million on research and development, focused on product and system sustainability improvements such as increasing energy efficiency, developing products that allow for use of lower global warming potential refrigerants, reducing material content in products, and designing products for circularity. All new product development (NPD) programs must complete a Design for Sustainability module within our NPD process to ensure that every program has a positive impact on sustainability. We also have a strong focus on sustaining activities, which include costs incurred to reduce production costs, improve existing products, create custom solutions for customers and provide support to our manufacturing facilities. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development and sustaining activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position.  Patents and Licenses Our intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, proprietary technology, technical data, business processes, and other confidential information. Although in the aggregate we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable to our operations, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them. In our opinion, engineering, production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our intellectual property rights. 6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Backlog Our backlog of orders, believed to be firm, at December\u00a031, was as follows: In millions20222021Americas$5,325.2\u00a0$3,856.7\u00a0EMEA616.1\u00a0727.2\u00a0Asia Pacific941.8\u00a0852.8\u00a0Total$6,883.1\u00a0$5,436.7\u00a0 These backlog figures are based on orders received and only include amounts associated with our equipment and contracting and installation performance obligations. Beginning in 2022, our backlog figures include additional revenue streams due to increased lead times. A major portion of our residential products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock. As a result, we expect to ship a majority of the December\u00a031, 2022 backlog during 2023. However, orders for specialized machinery or specific customer applications are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision and deferral, and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, we experienced significant increases in end market demand for our sustainability-focused products and services resulting in a higher backlog of orders in the current year as compared to prior year. In addition, we are seeing industry-wide supply chain and resource constraints impacting our ability to produce and ship product, which we are proactively managing. To the extent projects are delayed or there are additional supply chain and resource constraints, the timing of our revenue could be affected. Environmental Matters We continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources, reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities and off-site waste disposal facilities. It is our policy to establish environmental reserves for investigation and remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. Estimated liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations due to unknown environmental conditions, changes in government laws and regulations, and changes in cleanup technologies. The environmental reserves are updated on a routine basis as remediation efforts progress and new information becomes available.  We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state and international authorities. We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. In most instances at multi-party sites, our share of the liability is not material. In estimating our liability at multi-party sites, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties\u2019 financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis.  For a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities, see Note 20 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Separation of Industrial Segment Businesses On February 29, 2020 (Distribution Date), we completed our Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the Transaction) with Gardner Denver Holdings, Inc. (Gardner Denver, which changed its name to Ingersoll Rand Inc. (Ingersoll Rand) after the Transaction) whereby we distributed Ingersoll-Rand U.S. HoldCo, Inc., which contained our former Industrial segment (Ingersoll Rand Industrial) through a pro rata distribution (the Distribution) to shareholders of record as of February 24, 2020 (Spin-off Shareholders). Ingersoll Rand Industrial then merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand. Upon close of the Transaction, the Spin-off Shareholders received 50.1% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock on a fully-diluted basis and Gardner Denver shareholders retained 49.9% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand on a fully diluted basis. As a result, the Spin-off Shareholders received .8824 shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock with respect to each share owned as of February 24, 2020. In connection with the Transaction, we received a special cash payment of $1.9\u00a0billion.  During the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, the Company recorded a reduction to Retained earnings of $18.9 million primarily related to tax matters associated with Ingersoll Rand Industrial and the settlement of certain items related to the Transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid Ingersoll Rand $49.5 million to settle certain items related to the Transaction. This payment was related to working capital, cash and indebtedness amounts as of the Distribution Date, as well as funding levels related to pension plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans and retiree health benefits. We recorded the settlement as a reduction to Retained earnings during the first quarter of 2021.  After the Distribution Date, we do not beneficially own any Ingersoll Rand Industrial shares of common stock and no longer consolidate Ingersoll Rand Industrial in our financial statements. The historical results of Ingersoll Rand Industrial are presented as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Asbestos-Related Matters We are involved in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings. In June 2020, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries Aldrich Pump LLC (Aldrich) and Murray Boiler LLC (Murray) each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte (the Bankruptcy Court). As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to the imposition of a statutory automatic stay applicable in Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. Only Aldrich and Murray have filed for Chapter 11 relief. Neither Aldrich's wholly-owned subsidiary, 200 Park, Inc. (200 Park), Murray's wholly-owned subsidiary, ClimateLabs LLC (ClimateLabs), Trane Technologies plc nor its other subsidiaries (the Trane Companies) are part of the Chapter 11 filings. In addition, at the request of Aldrich and Murray, the Bankruptcy Court has entered an order temporarily staying all asbestos-related claims against the Trane Companies that relate to claims against Aldrich or Murray (except for asbestos-related claims for which the exclusive remedy is provided under workers' compensation statutes or similar laws). The goal of these Chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos-related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants, Aldrich and Murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestos-related claims against Aldrich and Murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures. For detailed information on the bankruptcy cases of Aldrich and Murray, see: \u2022Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Litigation,\" \u2022Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings,\" \u2022Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Significant Events,\" and  \u2022Part II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, \"Description of Company,\" and Note 20, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\" Human Capital Management Our people and culture are critical to achieving our operational, financial and strategic success.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we employed approximately 39,000 people in nearly 60 countries including approximately 14,000 outside of the United States. As of December\u00a031, 2022, 25.7% of our global employees were women and 37.4% of our employees in the United States were racially and ethnically diverse. In 2022, 30.2% of our new hires globally were women and 50.5% of new hires in the United States were racially and ethnically diverse. Approximately 24.2% of leadership and management positions were held by women as of December\u00a031, 2022. The diversity percentages included in this section exclude current year business acquisitions. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents As a result of maintaining a consistent focus on an uplifting culture, our key talent (employees with the highest potential rating) retention rate excluding retirements in 2022 was 93.1%. Our company\u2011wide (all employees) voluntary retention rate excluding retirements was 86.3%. Culture and Purpose In 2022, we continued to drive our purpose to boldly challenge what\u2019s possible for a sustainable world through our strategic priorities and 2030 Sustainability Commitments. We use our Leadership Principles to guide our actions each day and enable our uplifting, engaging and inclusive culture. As part of our commitment to people and culture, we strive to create a work environment where our people uplift each other, make a positive impact on the planet and thrive at work and at home.   Since 2006, our annual employee engagement survey has enabled employees to share their experiences and perceptions of our Company. Employees provide ratings and written comments for continuous improvement. In 2022, 88% of our workforce participated in our annual engagement survey, and our overall employee engagement score remains high. While our work on culture is never done, these scores indicate that we\u2019re continuing to raise the bar to increase pride, energy and optimism across the company and create the best employee experience. Diversity and Inclusion Our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion is core to our purpose and our 2030 Sustainability Commitments. We are proud members of Paradigm for Parity (a coalition of more than 100 corporations who have committed to closing the gender gap in corporate leadership) and OneTen (a coalition dedicated to hiring one million Black Americans in the next ten years to achieve economic mobility). In addition, we are a 2017 signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge (the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace). We offer company-sponsored forums to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace including: \u2022Bridging Connections \u2013 a safe forum created to allow our employees to speak from the heart about a variety of topics without fear of retribution. \u2022Employee Resources Groups (ERGs) \u2013 we sponsor eight ERGs (the Women's Employee Network, the Black Employee Network, the Veterans Employee Resource Group, the Asian Employee Resource Group, the Global Organization of Latinos, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Allies (LGBTA) Employee Resource Group, the InterGenerational Employee Network, and VisAbility). All ERGs are voluntary, open and inclusive organizations that offer employees a sense of belonging, networking and learning opportunities.  \u2022Women\u2019s Leadership Development Programs \u25e6The Women in Action Leadership Program is a virtual, self-paced cohort program that provides women with access to content that promotes their leadership development skills.  \u25e6The Women on the Rise (WOR) program is designed over eight-weeks to help empower, develop, connect and support emerging women leaders. \u25e6The Women\u2019s Leadership Program (WLP) is a cohort program for high potential talent that provides an opportunity to network with other senior women leaders, gain individual insights through an executive mentoring partnership and build leadership skills and confidence through a variety of learning components, speakers, experiences and assessments. \u2022In 2022, the Inclusive Leader Learning Experience was promoted to people leaders detailing three stages of inclusive leadership: Becoming Aware, Becoming an Ally and Upstander, and Becoming a Change Agent.  \u2022In 2022, the Global Diversity & Inclusion summit continued its focus on development of the inclusive leader behaviors; highlighting allyship. Additionally, our corporate citizenship strategy, Sustainable Futures, which was launched in 2021, aims at creating educational and career opportunities specifically for people of color who are under-represented in our industry. This strategy will support our efforts to create opportunity for all by providing marginalized students with a range of resources, from classroom curriculum introducing them to careers at a climate innovation company, to soft-skill development for landing a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) job.  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Learning and Development We offer learning and career development opportunities that enhance our employees\u2019 skills and abilities and ensure contemporary technical and functional skills and competencies such as innovation, collaboration and leadership. Examples of these programs include:  \u2022Team Leader Development Program \u2013 An eight-week experiential development program that engages, teaches and empowers front-line plant leaders to apply continuous improvement methods, make sound business decisions, solve problems, and serve as a coach to their teams. \u2022Graduate Training Program (GTP) \u2013 A five-month development program designed to prepare university graduate engineers for a rewarding career in technical sales.

Topics include certification in our Code of Conduct, Information Security, Understanding and Preventing Sexual Harassment and Human Trafficking Prevention. All salaried employees globally complete our annual compliance curriculum. Employee Volunteerism In 2022, with the height of the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, we saw many employees re-engage in in-person volunteerism. From Monterrey, Mexico to St. Paul, MN and Dubai UAE to Davidson, NC, our teams made meaningful contributions to their local communities.  This year, we formed Purple Teams, a new global employee network that provides vital support for driving our corporate citizenship efforts around the world, and volunteerism in particular. More than 70 Purple Teams were stood up, spanning each business and region where we do business. They are comprised of local champions who will cultivate the spirit of volunteerism, ensure alignment with our strategy, and also help ensure accurate data tracking. After launching in summer 2022, one of their first coordinated engagements was a back-to-school volunteer literacy project in partnership with Reading Is Fundamental. Employees in multiple locations donated hundreds of hours assembling literacy backpacks with three new STEM-themed books and bookmarks for more than 11,000 elementary school students around the U.S. Our definition of the term community also includes our own colleagues and this year, we were honored to be able to provide relief grant support to nearly 800 employees in Puerto Rico who were impacted by Hurricane Ivan.  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Employee Well-being Trane Technologies believes employees that can thrive at work, at home and in their communities are our greatest asset. We integrate well-being into our culture through core global resources that support physical, social, emotional, and financial well-being. Several elements of our holistic well-being actions include:  \u2022Giving 100% of our team members access to company-sponsored wellness offerings, including a global Employee Assistance Program and a global wellness platform covering an array of topics like mindfulness, resiliency, and nutrition.  \u2022Offering financial relief through the Helping Hand program, an employee funded program created to help associates facing financial hardship immediately after a qualified disaster or an unforeseen personal hardship.  \u2022Implementing and adapting Flex Time and Flex Place policies and resources as well as work-from-home arrangements, and other approaches to support evolving employee needs.  Recognizing the pervasiveness of mental health challenges facing employees and their families post-pandemic, we prioritized mental well-being globally by:  \u2022Introducing a series of conversations with team members around the world to share their stories related to mental health to address stigma and promote a culture that encourages and supports open discussion about mental health issues.  \u2022Implementing an enterprise Mental Well-Being Hub to streamline access to mental health resources and guidance for supporting others and leveraging our global Employee Assistance Program to provide frequent communications targeted to concerns such as mental health, stress & burnout, relationships, childcare and education.  Competitive Pay and Benefits Trane Technologies\u2019 compensation programs and policies are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the Company\u2019s performance and strategy: to attract and retain a talented workforce and to meet the needs of employees globally. We are committed to providing competitive and equitable wages and benefits that will allow our employees to thrive at work and at home. In addition, the structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both long-term and short-term performance, with our annual incentive plan closely tied to our 2030 sustainability commitments, which includes environmental sustainability and workforce diversity goals, in addition to financial goals. Trane Technologies\u2019 benefits programs and policies are designed to support the well-being of employees and their families. Purpose-driven and locally relevant benefits programs are provided globally. In addition to core and competitive medical, welfare and retirement programs, we offer programs to support work-life balance, including: \u2022Expanded family support programs inclusive of child and elder back-up care programs; \u2022Enhanced parental leave programs; and  \u2022Tuition assistance to support the ongoing growth and development of our employees. Our proxy statement provides more detail on the competitive compensation and benefit programs we offer. Employee Safety  In 2022, we continued our multi-year, world class safety record with a Lost-time Incident Rate of 0.13 and Recordable Rate below 1.00. In response to the pandemic, we continue to monitor, track, update and implement our COVID-19 guidance based on World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. and European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other local or country specific guidelines. We completed over 35,000 observations of our service technicians and manufacturing employees to ensure all employees were following safe work practices and COVID-19 protocols.  In addition, we reviewed and updated our Automatic External Defibrillator program so that locations globally can respond to sudden cardiac arrest emergencies. We also continue to maintain all our locations globally as Tobacco Free Workplaces.  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents Available Information We have used, and intend to continue to use, the homepage, the investor relations and the \u201cNews\u201d section of our website (www.tranetechnologies.com), among other sources such as press releases, public conference calls and webcasts, as a means of disclosing additional information, which may include future developments regarding the Company and/or material non-public information.
