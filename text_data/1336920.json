See \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Although we do not currently anticipate that the costs of complying with, or the liabilities associated with, environmental laws will materially and adversely affect us, we cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future. Research and Development  We conduct research and development activities under customer-funded contracts and with company-funded research and development funds. Company-funded research and development includes independent research and development (\"IR&D\") and commercial and international research and development. Company-funded research and development expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Our company-funded research and development expense was $116 million, $109 million and $73 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which as a percentage of consolidated revenues was 0.8% for both fiscal 2022 and 2021 and 0.6% for fiscal 2020. We charge expenses for research and development activities performed under customer contracts directly to cost of revenues for those contracts. Intellectual Property Rights Our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection, although we do selectively seek patent protection. We claim a proprietary interest in certain of our products, software programs, methodologies and know-how. This proprietary information is protected in confidence as trade secrets, using non-disclosure and other definitive agreements. We selectively pursue opportunities to license or transfer our technologies to third parties. In connection with the performance of services and solutions, the U.S. government has certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material that we develop under U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts. Generally, the U.S. government may disclose or license such information to third parties, including, in some instances, our competitors. In the case of some subcontracts that we perform, the prime contractor generally obtains rights to use the programs and products that we deliver under the subcontract to perform its prime contract obligations. Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 10 Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 10 Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 10 Table of ContentsPART I Table of Contents PART I  Competition Competition for contracts is significant, and we often compete against a large number of well-established corporations that may have greater name and brand recognition. We also compete against smaller, more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas, the U.S. government\u2019s own capabilities and federal non-profit contract research centers. As a result of the diverse requirements of the U.S. government and our commercial customers, we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts and bid against these same companies in other situations. We believe that our principal competitors currently include the following companies: Amentum Services Inc., Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., CACI International Inc., General Dynamics Corporation, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., KBR Inc., L3Harris, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, SAIC and Peraton. These companies span across sectors that include engineering and technical services divisions of large defense contractors, diversified U.S. and international IT providers and contractors focused solely on technical services, supply chain management, other logistics services and major systems operations and maintenance, homeland security and health solutions. We compete on various factors, including our technical expertise and qualified professional and/or security-cleared personnel, our ability to deliver innovative cost-effective solutions in a timely manner, successful program execution, our reputation and standing with customers, pricing, the size and geographic presence of our company and past performance credentials. Contract Procurement  Our business is heavily regulated, and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government and other contracts. The U.S. government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives. Today, U.S. government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products. Budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many U.S. government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that give them the ability to select multiple contract winners or pre-qualify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through single-award contracts. The predominant contracting methods through which U.S. government agencies procure services and products include the following: \u2022Definitive Award Contracts. U.S. government agencies may procure services and products through single definitive award contracts which specify the scope of services or products purchased and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services or products. When an agency has a requirement, the agency will issue a solicitation or request for proposal to which interested contractors can submit a proposal. The bidding and selection process can take a year or more to complete. For the contractor, this method of contracting may provide greater certainty of the timing and amounts to be received at the time of contract award because it generally results in the customer contracting for a specific scope of services or products from the single definitive successful awardee. \u2022Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (\"IDIQ\") Contracts. The U.S. government uses IDIQ contracts to obtain commitments from contractors to provide certain services or products on pre-established terms and conditions. The U.S. government then issues task orders under the IDIQ contracts to purchase the specific services or products it needs. IDIQ contracts are awarded to one or more contractors following a competitive procurement process. Under a single-award IDIQ contract, all task orders under that contract are awarded to one pre-established contractor. Under a multiple-award IDIQ contract, task orders can be awarded to any of the pre-established contractors, which can result in further limited competition for the award of task orders. Multiple-award IDIQ contracts that are open for any government agency to use for procurement are commonly referred to as \"government-wide acquisition contracts.\" IDIQ contracts often have multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts, therefore enabling, but not committing, the U.S. government to purchase substantial amounts of services or products from one or more contractors. At the time an IDIQ contract is awarded (prior to the award of any task orders), a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the U.S. government will purchase under the contract, and in the case of a multiple-award IDIQ, the contractor from which such purchases may be made.

Annual Report - 11 Table of ContentsPART I Table of Contents PART I  \u2022U.S. General Services Administration (\"GSA\") Schedule Contracts. The GSA maintains listings of approved suppliers of services and products with agreed-upon prices for use throughout the U.S. government. In order for a company to provide services under a GSA Schedule contract, a company must be pre-qualified and awarded a contract by the GSA. When an agency uses a GSA Schedule contract to meet its requirements, the agency, or the GSA on behalf of the agency, conducts the procurement. The user agency, or the GSA on its behalf, evaluates the user agency\u2019s requirements and initiates a competition limited to GSA Schedule qualified contractors. GSA Schedule contracts are designed to provide the user agency with reduced procurement time and lower procurement costs. Similar to IDIQ contracts, at the time a GSA Schedule contract is awarded, a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the U.S. government will purchase under the contract. \u2022Other Transaction Authority (\u201cOTA\u201d) agreements. Under certain circumstances, U.S. government agencies can enter into OTA agreements instead of traditional contracts. These agreements are used for two primary purposes: (1) to carry out basic, applied or advanced research projects that typically relate to technology stimulation or research, and (2) to carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the DoD, or to improve platforms, systems, components or materials in use by DoD components and agencies. OTA agreements are generally exempt from federal procurement regulations. These exemptions grant the U.S. government the flexibility to include, amend or exclude contract clauses and requirements that are mandatory in traditional procurements. OTA agreements also grant more flexibility to structure agreements in numerous ways, including joint ventures, partnerships or multiple agencies joining together to fund an agreement encompassing multiple providers. We often partner with other companies, including our competitors, to submit bids for large U.S. government procurements or other opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract. Our relationships with our partners, including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor, vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the program, contract or customer requirements, as well as the relative size, qualifications, capabilities, customer relationships and experience of our company and our partners. Contracting with the U.S. government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks, including the U.S. government\u2019s ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. government. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the U.S. government issues a termination for convenience. These regulations and risks are described in more detail below under \"Business\u2013Regulation\" and \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Contract Types  Generally, the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the U.S. government and may depend on certain factors, including the type and complexity of the work to be performed, degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance, the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals. We generate revenues under several types of contracts, including the following: \u2022Cost-reimbursement contracts include cost-plus-fixed-fee, award-fee and incentive-fee contracts. These contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allocable indirect costs, plus a fee. These contracts are typically used when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price contract. Cost-reimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk but require us to use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and budget. Award and incentive fees are generally based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality and/or technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company's performance against contractual criteria. Incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs.

Annual Report - 12 Table of ContentsPART I Table of Contents PART I  \u2022Fixed-price-incentive-fee (\"FP-IF\") contracts are substantially similar to cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts except they require specified targets for cost and profit, price ceiling (but not a profit ceiling or floor) and profit adjustment formula. Under an FP-IF contract, the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to a cost-share arrangement, which affects profitability. Generally, if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated. \u2022Time-and-materials (\"T&M\") contracts typically provide for negotiated fixed hourly rates for specified categories of direct labor plus reimbursement of other direct costs. This type of contract is generally used when there is uncertainty about the extent or duration of the work to be performed by the contractor at the time of contract award or it is not possible to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. On T&M contracts, we assume the risk of providing appropriately qualified staff to perform these contracts at the hourly rates set forth in the contracts over the period of performance of the contracts. \u2022Fixed-price-level-of-effort (\"FP-LOE\") contracts are substantially similar to T&M contracts except they require a specified level of effort over a stated period of time on work that can be stated only in general terms. This type of contract is generally used when the contractor is required to perform an investigation or study in a specific research and development area and to provide a report showing the results achieved based on the level of effort. Payment is based on the effort expended rather than the results achieved. \u2022Firm-Fixed-Price (\u201cFFP\u201d) contracts provide for a fixed price for specified products, systems and/or services. This type of contract is typically used when the customer acquires products and services on the basis of reasonably definitive specifications that have a determinable fair and reasonable price. These contracts offer us potential increased profits if we can complete the work at lower costs than planned, but FFP contracts increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns. Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract and the nature of services or products provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive-fee and award-fee contracts, is finally determined. Cost-reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower profitability than FFP contracts.  Seasonality The U.S. government's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. While not certain, it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds, which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter. In addition, our quarterly results may be impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter. We tend to generate less revenue from our labor services during the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season. Regulation  We are heavily regulated in most of the fields in which we operate. We provide services and products to numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including to the DoD, the U.S. Intelligence Community and the DHS. When working with these and other U.S. government agencies and entities, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. Some significant laws and regulations that affect us include: \u2022the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\"FAR\") and supplements, including the DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (\"DFARS\"), which regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts; \u2022the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; \u2022the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials; Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 13 Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 13 Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 13 Table of ContentsPART I Table of Contents PART I  \u2022the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval; \u2022the False Statements Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability for making false statements to the U.S. government; and \u2022the U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (\"CAS\"), which imposes accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements. Among other things, these laws and regulations: \u2022require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; \u2022define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various cost-type U.S. government contracts; \u2022require compliance with U.S. government CAS; \u2022require reviews by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\"), Defense Contract Management Agency (\"DCMA\") and other U.S. government agencies of compliance with government requirements for a contractor\u2019s business systems; \u2022restrict the use and dissemination of and require the protection of unclassified contract-related information and information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data; and \u2022require us not to compete for work if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest, as defined by these laws and regulations, related to such work exists and/or cannot be appropriately mitigated, neutralized or avoided. The U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time. In order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance trainings relevant to their position. Privacy and Data Security Laws Some of our operations and service offerings involve access to and use by us of personally identifiable information and/or protected health information. These activities are regulated by extensive federal, state and international privacy and data security laws requiring organizations to provide certain privacy protections and security safeguards for such information. For example: \u2022the European Union's (\"EU\u2019s\") General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in May 2018, has created new compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of EU data subjects, which require investment into ongoing data protection activities and documentation requirements, and creates the potential for significantly increased fines for noncompliance;  \u2022the United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cUK\u2019s\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect on January 1, 2021, creates similar compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of UK data subjects as are imposed by the EU GDPR;  \u2022the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020, provides new consumer privacy rights to natural persons residing in California by regulating the processing of personal information of California residents and increasing the obligations on businesses in connection with such activities;  \u2022the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which took effect in most material respects on January 1, 2023. The CPRA modifies the CCPA significantly, including by expanding consumers\u2019 rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information, extending the scope of the CCPA to include employees and job applicants residing in California and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts; and   Leidos Holdings, Inc.
