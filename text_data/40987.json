As used in this report, \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"GPC,\" and the \u201ccompany\u201d refers to GPC and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated by the context; and the terms \u201cautomotive parts\u201d and \u201cindustrial parts\u201d refer to replacement parts in each respective category. OUR PURPOSE & STRATEGY We are one global team unified by our purpose: We Keep the World Moving. This is the foundation for how we do business. Our mission is to be an employer of choice, supplier of choice, valued customer, good corporate citizen and investment of choice for all our shareholders. Additionally, we strive to be a respected community member that gives back to the communities in which we operate. In order to execute this mission, we align our resources with strategic areas of focus for our operations. Specifically, we focus on our market-leading automotive and industrial businesses in North America, Europe and Australasia to deliver profitable growth, operational efficiencies and strong cash flow.  We have strategic initiatives designed to build on our current competitive advantages. We believe our primary competitive advantages are our: (1) global presence and brand strength; (2) best-in-class operating and distribution efficiencies; and (3) enhanced technology solutions.  Our strategic financial objectives are intended to complement our mission and drive value for all our stakeholders. These financial objectives include: (1) revenue growth in excess of market growth; (2) improved operating margins; (3) a strong balance sheet and cash flows; and (4) effective capital allocation. Our strategy is designed to position us for long-term growth and enhance shareholder value.  OUR SEGMENTS AUTOMOTIVE PARTS GROUP (\"Automotive\") Our Automotive segment is the largest global automotive network of parts and care, distributing automotive parts, accessories and service items in North America, Europe and Australasia. Our Automotive business offers complete inventory, cataloging, marketing, training and other programs to the automotive aftermarket in each of these regions which distinguish this business from the competition. In North America, Automotive sells parts primarily under the National Automotive Parts Association (\"NAPA\") brand name through distribution centers and automotive parts stores (\u201cauto parts stores\u201d or \u201cNAPA AUTO PARTS stores\u201d). In Europe, Alliance Automotive Group (\u201cAAG\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, is a leading distributor of vehicle parts, tools and workshop equipment with its primary operations in nine European countries. AAG is rolling out the NAPA brand of products and currently serves its customers under a variety of banners, including Groupauto, Precisium Group, Pi\u00e8ces Auto, UAN, Alliance Automotive Group Germany, PartsPoint and Lausan. In Australasia, Automotive serves the market primarily under the Repco and NAPA brand names. Our global Automotive network sells to customers in both commercial do-it-for-me (\u201cDIFM\u201d) and retail do-it-yourself (\u201cDIY\u201d) segments of the market and covers substantially all global motor vehicle models. DIFM customers include local, regional and national repair centers, auto dealers, service stations and both private and public sector accounts. DIY customers are primarily served over-the-counter at our global stores or digitally. DIFM and DIY customers account for approximately 80% and 20% of Automotive total sales, respectively.  As part of our ongoing strategy, our Automotive network grew in 2022 with acquisitions of various strategic and bolt-on store groups in North America, Europe and Australasia. In Europe, we expanded our footprint in two new key markets in Spain and Portugal, Europe's fifth largest market, while also expanding into Eastern Germany. In Australasia, we acquired a leading Australian branded direct-to-consumer distributor of lighting products focused on the four-wheel drive market in Australasia and continued our bolt-on strategy in North America. Store Network.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table details the breakdown of our Automotive distribution network including our distribution centers, company-owned and independently-owned automotive stores by geographic region as of December\u00a031, 2022. 2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents North AmericaEuropeAustralasiaTotalDistribution centers77\u00a078\u00a014\u00a0169\u00a0Company-owned stores1,682\u00a0742\u00a0529\u00a02,953\u00a0Independently-owned stores5,037\u00a01,642\u00a0\u2014\u00a06,679\u00a0Total locations6,796\u00a02,462\u00a0543\u00a09,801\u00a0 The mix of company-owned stores versus independently-owned stores in a given market varies based on several factors including our overall market strategy, the ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability and expected ultimate size of the market and our ability to provide operational support within a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0geographic region. In our Australasian operations, we go to market with a company-owned store model. Independently-owned stores purchase inventory from company-operated distribution centers. These independently-owned stores are responsible for operating and managing their business, including operating costs and capital expenditures. We do not receive a royalty or franchise fee from independently-owned stores. Our 169 Automotive distribution centers serve both company-owned and independently-owned stores located throughout the geographic regions in which we operate. Both types of automotive stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. During 2022, we expanded our network with the addition of 138 net new stores during the year.  Products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our automotive distribution network provides access to hundreds of thousands of different replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle makes and models, including hybrid and electric vehicles, trucks, SUVs, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. Each part is cataloged and numbered for identification and accessibility. Availability is a critical success factor in our business and our teams utilize data and analytics to have the right parts, in the right place and at the right time. We do not manufacture any of the products we distribute. The majority of products distributed in North America are under the NAPA name, a mark licensed to us by NAPA, which is important to the sales and marketing of these products. In Australasia and Europe, products are distributed under several brand names, including many of the national brands, as well as the NAPA name. Our Automotive operations have access to more than 725,000 different parts and related supply items. These items are purchased from hundreds of different suppliers, with approximately 46% of 2022 automotive parts inventories purchased from 10 major suppliers. We also distribute replacement parts for small engines, farm equipment, marine equipment and heavy duty equipment. Our inventories also include accessory items for vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation.  Traction, our heavy duty parts business in North America sells products distributed under the HD Plus name, a proprietary line of automotive parts for heavy duty truck market. Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We believe that the quality and the range of services provided to our North American automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for our automotive parts distribution system. Our goal is to properly stock our locations with the right parts to ensure we provide quick and quality service to our customers whose orders are often filled and shipped the same day they are received. Our services also include up to date parts cataloging (including the use of electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock adjustments through a continuing parts classification system which, as initiated by us, allows independently-owned stores to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. We offer our NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs.  We have developed and refined an inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological advances, including predictive analytics, and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous analytical review, is an integral part of our inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management services that we make available to our NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Losses from inventory obsolescence have not been significant historically and we attribute this to the successful operation of our classification system, which includes product return privileges with most of our suppliers. NAPA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association, LLC a voluntary association formed in 1925 to promote the distribution of automotive parts for its members. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents automotive parts, functions as a trade association that develops marketing concepts and programs for its sole member. Among the automotive products purchased by us from various manufacturers for distribution are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as \u201cNAPA\u201d lines. Generally, we are not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts and we may purchase competitive lines from the same as well as other supply sources. We use the federally registered trademark NAPA\u00ae as part of the trade name of our distribution centers and parts stores. We fund NAPA\u2019s national advertising program, which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines. We are a party to, together with the former members of NAPA, a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May\u00a04, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among us and former NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers. Competition.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The automotive aftermarket is highly competitive. We compete with other national, regional and local automotive parts chains, automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers, and warehouse clubs. In addition, we compete with the distributing outlets of parts manufacturers, mass merchandisers (including national retail chains) and other parts distributors and retailers, including online retailers. We compete primarily on availability of product offering, service, brand recognition and price. Our automotive competitors include AutoZone, Inc., O-Reilly Auto Parts, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, Inc., LKQ Corporation, Bapcor and Uni-Select, among many others. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in \u201cItem\u00a01A. Risk Factors\u00a0\u2014 We face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.\u201d  INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP (\"Industrial\") Our Industrial segment operates in both North America and Australasia through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Motion Industries, Inc.

These services and supply chain efficiencies assist Motion in providing the cost savings that many of its customers require and expect. Distribution Network.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table details the breakdown of our Industrial distribution centers, branches and service centers by geographic region as of December\u00a031, 2022. 4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents North AmericaAustralasiaTotalDistribution centers 19\u00a016\u00a035\u00a0Branches549\u00a0148\u00a0697\u00a0Service Centers67\u00a02\u00a069\u00a0Total locations635\u00a0166\u00a0801\u00a0 Our 35 Industrial distribution centers serve the branches and services centers located throughout the geographic regions in which we operate. The branches and service centers, in turn, sell to MRO and OEM customers in all types of industries across North America and Australasia. In North America, our Industrial business stocks or distributes more than 19 million different items purchased from more than 49,000 different suppliers. Its service centers provide hydraulic, hose and mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately 46% of total industrial product purchases in 2022 were made from our top 50 strategic suppliers. Sales are generated from facilities in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Mexico and Canada.  In Australasia, our Industrial business operates a network of distribution centers, branches and service centers across Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore as of December\u00a031, 2022. Our Industrial network was expanded on January 3, 2022 with the acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group (\"KDG\"). KDG, which is headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut, is a power transmission, automation and fluid power industrial distributor and solutions provider with operations throughout the United States, providing electro-mechanical products, bearings, power transmission, motion control and electrical and fluid power components to MRO and OEM customers. This strategic and highly synergistic combination significantly enhances our scale and strengthens our market leading position, creating a premier leader of industrial solutions. Most branches are facilities that stock inventory representative of the products used by customers in the respective market areas served.  Products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Industrial distributes a wide variety of parts and products to its customers, which are primarily industrial companies. Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears, sprockets, speed reducers, electric motors, industrial supplies, assembly tools, test equipment, adhesives and chemicals. Industrial also offers systems and automation products that support sophisticated motion control and process automation for full systems integration of plant equipment. The nature of Motion's business demands the maintenance of adequate inventories and the ability to promptly meet critical delivery requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer or used in plant and facility maintenance activities. Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24\u00a0hours of order receipt. The majority of all sales are on open account. Motion has ongoing purchase agreements with many of its national account customers which, collectively, represent approximately 40% of the annual sales volume. Supplier Agreements.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been our experience that the custom of the trade is to treat such agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent.  Competition.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The industrial distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with national, regional and local distributors specializing in the distribution of such items, general line distributors and others who provide similar services. To a lesser extent, we compete with manufacturers that sell directly to the customer and with various industrial eCommerce sites. Our Industrial competitors include Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., Fastenal Company, and W.W. Grainger, Inc, among many others. We compete primarily on the breadth of product offerings, quality service and competitive pricing. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in \u201cItem\u00a01A. Risk Factors\u00a0\u2014 We face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.\u201d  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE We are committed to the development of sustainable and efficient operations and business practices that enhance and protect our people, our communities and our planet. Our goal is to generate above-market returns while aligning our business practices to support the interests of our stakeholders. Our process of defining sustainability priorities focuses on the simultaneous improvement of our environmental, social and financial position, and our strong leadership and governance practices that strive to integrate sustainability into our business strategy and corporate culture.

Our leadership team reviews the survey results and based on the survey responses, action plans are developed to focus on areas of opportunity. We are pleased to report that our most recent engagement survey results were favorable overall and have shown that our employees are proud to work for us. The results of the engagement surveys help us continuously improve our human capital strategies and find ways to foster engagement and growth for our employees. In addition, to empower employees to continually enhance their skills and reach their maximum potential, we provide a range of development programs, resources, and opportunities. Many are facilitated locally by each business with core leadership development at the Corporate level. One of our more significant programs is focused on high potential employees from all global business units. This program is a combination of in-person and virtual coursework and training with the intent that participants become fully immersed in the operations of our business and develop strategies and improvements cross-functionally. We also offer various internship and rotational programs that allow employees to see different operations of our business while also building strong relationships throughout the company. Other development opportunities include on-demand and live training courses to help our employees achieve their professional and personal goals. We believe these programs demonstrate our ongoing commitment to develop our future leaders.

Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council, led by senior leadership and representatives from each business unit have helped to ensure accountabilities exist to advance new and current DEI initiatives. Some initiatives include, providing scholarships with an emphasis for students who attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities and collaboration with organizations that support women such as Women in Technology and Women in Auto Care. Our commitment also includes supporting organizations that advance the interests of disadvantaged individuals and communities in need. We continue to partner with Georgia Minority Supplier Diversity Council, the Georgia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, United Way's African American Partnership and Young Professional Leaders programs. Our efforts are also directed internally where we encourage the exchange of ideas, actively listen to employee dialogue, provide appropriate training, and ensure that the interests of all our employees are supported and advanced. This year we launched four business resource groups (\"BRGs\") - African American, Asian, Veteran and Women, for our corporate teammates in the Unites States. These BRGs provide our teammates with venues for personal and professional development, including networking, coaching, skill building, community engagement, volunteering and advancement opportunities. These groups play a key role in educating and engaging teammates in our DEI goals and efforts. We aim to leverage key learnings from these groups and expand the program globally.
