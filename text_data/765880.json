{"cik": 765880, "item_1A": "ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business General Overview  Healthpeak Properties, Inc. is a Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d)\u00a0500 company that acquires, develops, owns, leases, and manages healthcare real estate across the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d). Our company was originally founded in 1985. We are a Maryland corporation and qualify as a self-administered REIT. Our corporate headquarters are located in Denver, Colorado, and we have additional offices in California, Tennessee, and Massachusetts. During 2020, we began the process of disposing of our senior housing triple-net and senior housing operating property (\u201cSHOP\u201d) portfolios. As of December 31, 2020, we concluded that the planned dispositions represented a strategic shift that had and will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the assets are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented herein. In September 2021, we successfully completed the disposition of both portfolios. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding discontinued operations. In conjunction with the disposal of our senior housing triple-net and SHOP portfolios, we focused our strategy on investing in a diversified portfolio of high-quality healthcare properties across our three core asset classes of life science, medical office, and continuing care retirement community (\u201cCCRC\u201d) real estate. Under the life science and medical office segments, we invest through the acquisition, development, and management of life science facilities, MOBs, and hospitals. Under the CCRC segment, our properties are operated through RIDEA structures. We have other non-reportable segments that are comprised primarily of loans receivable, marketable debt securities, and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owns 19 senior housing assets (our \u201cSWF SH JV\u201d).  At December\u00a031, 2022, our portfolio of investments, including properties in our unconsolidated joint ventures, consisted of interests in 480 properties.

For a description of our significant activities during 2022, see \u201cItem 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Overview of Transactions\u201d in this report. UPREIT Reorganization On February 7, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with New Healthpeak, Inc., a Maryland corporation (\u201cNew Healthpeak\u201d) and our wholly owned subsidiary, and Healthpeak Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d) that is a wholly owned subsidiary of New Healthpeak. The purpose of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is for us to implement a corporate reorganization into a new holding company structure commonly referred to as an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust, or UPREIT (the \u201cReorganization\u201d).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into our company, with our company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of New Healthpeak (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The Merger is expected to be effective as of February 10, 2023 (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d). As part of the Merger, our name will change to Healthpeak Properties Interim, Inc., and, effective immediately after the Effective Time, New Healthpeak\u2019s name will be changed to Healthpeak Properties, Inc. The Merger is expected to be conducted in accordance with Section 3-106.2 of the Maryland General Corporation Law. Accordingly, the Merger will not require the approval of our stockholders, and the Merger will not give rise to statutory dissenters\u2019 rights. In connection with the Reorganization and immediately following the Merger, we will convert from a Maryland corporation to a Maryland limited liability company named Healthpeak OP, LLC (\u201cHealthpeak OP\u201d).  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents Following the Merger, the business, management and board of directors of New Healthpeak will be identical to the business, management and board of directors of our company immediately before the Merger, except that the business of the company is expected to be conducted exclusively through Healthpeak OP. The consolidated assets and liabilities of New Healthpeak immediately following the Merger will be identical to the consolidated assets and liabilities of our company immediately prior to the Merger. New Healthpeak will not hold any assets directly other than its ownership interest in Healthpeak OP and certain de minimis assets that may be held for certain administrative functions. None of the properties owned by us or our subsidiaries or any interests therein will be transferred as part of the Reorganization. All material indebtedness of our company immediately prior to the Merger will remain the indebtedness of Healthpeak OP after the Merger. Business Strategy  We invest in and manage our real estate portfolio for the long-term to maximize benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends. Our strategy consists of four core elements:  (i)Our real estate: Our portfolio is grounded in high-quality properties in desirable locations. We focus on three purposely selected private pay asset classes\u2014life science, medical office, and continuing care retirement community\u2014to provide stability through inevitable market cycles. (ii)Our financials: We maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet with ample liquidity as well as long-term fixed-rate debt financing with staggered maturities to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk. (iii)Our partnerships: We work with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnical companies, healthcare companies, operators, and service providers and are responsive to their space and capital needs. We provide high-quality property management services to encourage tenants to renew, expand, and relocate into our properties, which drives increased occupancy, rental rates, and property values. (iv)Our platform: We have a people-first culture that we believe attracts, develops, and retains top talent. We continually strive to create and maintain an industry-leading platform with systems and tools that allow us to effectively and efficiently manage our assets and investment activity. Internal Growth Strategies We believe our real estate portfolio holds the potential for increased future cash flows as it is well-maintained and in desirable locations. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to: (i) work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and (ii) provide high-quality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew, expand, or relocate into our properties. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to: \u2022Build and maintain long-term leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators. In choosing locations for our properties, we focus on the physical environment, adjacency to established businesses (e.g., hospital systems) and educational centers, proximity to sources of business growth, and other local demographic factors. \u2022Replace tenants at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs. We believe we are well-positioned to attract new tenants and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location, design, and maintenance of our properties, together with our reputation for high-quality building services, responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolio. \u2022Extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration. We structure lease extensions, early renewals, or modifications, which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime, while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants on a long-term basis. Investment Strategies The delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and, as a result, tenants and operators depend on real estate, in part, to maintain and grow their businesses. We believe the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the: (i) compelling long-term demographics driving the demand for healthcare services; (ii) specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing; and (iii) ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector. 4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents While we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership, we may also provide real estate secured financing to, or invest in equity or debt securities of, healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership. We may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, operating companies, or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies. We may co-invest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies. We monitor our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type, investment vehicle, or geographic location, the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator, or loans that may be made to a single borrower. In allocating capital, we target opportunities with the most attractive risk/reward profile for our portfolio as a whole. We may take additional measures to mitigate risk, including diversifying our investments (by sector, geography, tenant, or operator), structuring transactions as master leases, requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications, and/or obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, letters of credit, or security deposits. We believe we are well-positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions, development, and redevelopment. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include: \u2022our reputation gained through over three decades of successful operations and the strength of our existing portfolio of properties; \u2022our relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology tenants, healthcare operators and systems, investment banks and other market intermediaries, corporations, private equity firms, not-for-profit organizations, and companies seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities; \u2022our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality healthcare real estate; \u2022our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently, which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas; \u2022our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries; and \u2022our control of land sites held for future development. Financing Strategies Our REIT qualification requires us to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains); therefore, we do not retain a significant amount of earnings. As a result, we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments, develop and redevelop properties, and refinance maturing debt.\u00a0 We may finance acquisitions and other investments primarily through the following vehicles: \u2022cash flow from operations; \u2022sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties or other investments; \u2022borrowings under our credit facility or commercial paper program; \u2022issuance of additional debt, including unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt; and/or \u2022issuance of common stock or preferred stock or its equivalent. We maintain a disciplined investment-grade balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining access to multiple sources of liquidity. Our debt obligations are primarily long-term fixed rate with staggered maturities. We finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or commercial paper program, arrange for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources, or issue equity securities pursuant to our at-the-market equity offering program. We arrange for longer-term financing by offering debt and equity, placing mortgage debt, and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners. 5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Segments  Life science Our life science properties, which contain laboratory and office space, are leased primarily to biotechnology, medical device and pharmaceutical companies, scientific research institutions, government agencies, and other organizations involved in the life science industry. While these properties have certain characteristics similar to commercial office buildings, they generally accommodate heavier floor loads and contain more advanced electrical, mechanical, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems. The facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators, fume hoods, lab bench tops, and related amenities. In addition to improvements funded by us as the landlord, many of our life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space to accommodate biology, chemistry, or medical device research initiatives. Life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings. The business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible, contiguous/adjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants. Our properties are located in well-established geographical markets known for scientific research and drug discovery, including San Francisco (49%) and San Diego (24%), California, and Boston, Massachusetts (24%) (based on total square feet). At December\u00a031, 2022, 92% of our life science properties were triple-net leased (based on leased square feet). The following table provides information about our most significant life science tenant concentration for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022: TenantsPercentage ofSegment RevenuesPercentage ofTotal RevenuesAmgen, Inc.6\u00a0%2\u00a0% Medical office Our medical office segment includes medical office buildings (MOBs) and hospitals. MOBs typically contain physicians\u2019 offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space, and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers, rehabilitation clinics, and day-surgery operating rooms. While these facilities have certain similarities to commercial office buildings, they require additional plumbing, electrical, and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room and specialized equipment such as x-ray machines and MRIs. MOBs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for such specialized equipment and may contain vaults or other unique construction. Our MOBs are typically multi-tenant properties leased to healthcare providers (hospitals and physician practices), with approximately 87% of our MOBs located on or adjacent to hospital campuses and 98% affiliated with hospital systems as of December\u00a031, 2022 (based on total square feet). Occasionally, we invest in MOBs located on hospital campuses subject to ground leases. At December\u00a031, 2022, approximately 65% of our MOBs were triple-net leased (based on leased square feet)\u00a0with the remaining leased under gross or modified gross leases. The following table provides information about our most significant medical office tenant concentration for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022: TenantPercentage ofSegment RevenuesPercentage ofTotal RevenuesHCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA)23\u00a0%8\u00a0% Our medical office segment also includes nine hospitals. Services provided by our tenants and operators in hospitals are paid for by private sources, third-party payors (e.g.,\u00a0insurance and HMOs), or through Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our hospital property types include acute care, long-term acute care, and specialty and rehabilitation hospitals. All of our hospitals are triple-net leased. Continuing care retirement community, or CCRC CCRCs are retirement communities that include independent living, assisted living, memory care, and skilled nursing units to provide a continuum of care in an integrated campus. Our CCRCs are owned through RIDEA structures, which is permitted by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, and includes most of the provisions previously proposed in the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007. The services provided by our third-party manager-operators under a RIDEA structure at our properties are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. 6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents A RIDEA structure allows us, through a taxable REIT subsidiary (\u201cTRS\u201d), to receive cash flow from the operations of a healthcare facility in compliance with REIT tax requirements. The criteria for operating a healthcare facility through a RIDEA structure require us to lease the facility to an affiliate TRS and for such affiliate TRS to engage an independent qualifying management company (also known as an eligible independent contractor or third-party operator) to manage and operate the day-to-day business of the facility in exchange for a management fee. As a result, under a RIDEA structure, we are required to rely on a third-party operator to hire and train all facility employees, enter into third-party contracts for the benefit of the facility, including resident/patient agreements, comply with laws, including healthcare laws, and provide resident care. We are substantially limited in our ability to control or influence day-to-day operations under a RIDEA structure, and thus rely on the third-party operator to manage and operate the business.  Through our TRS entities, we bear all operational risks and liabilities associated with the operation of these properties, with limited exceptions, such as a third-party operator\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct. These operational risks and liabilities include those relating to any employment matters of our operator, compliance with healthcare and other laws, liabilities relating to personal injury-tort matters, resident-patient quality of care claims, and any governmental reimbursement matters, even though we have limited ability to control or influence our third-party operators\u2019 management of these risks.  The management agreements we have in RIDEA structures related to CCRCs have original terms ranging from 10 to 15 years, with mutual renewal options. There are base management fees and incentive management fees payable to our third-party operators if operating results of the RIDEA properties exceed pre-established thresholds. Conversely, there are also provisions in the management agreements that reduce management fees payable to our third-party operators if operating results do not meet certain pre-established thresholds. CCRCs are different from other housing and care options for seniors because they typically provide written agreements or long-term contracts between residents and the communities (frequently lasting the term of the resident\u2019s lifetime), which offer a continuum of housing, services, and healthcare on one campus or site. CCRCs are appealing as they allow residents to \u201cage in place\u201d and typically the individual is independent and in relatively good health upon entry.  As third-party operators manage our RIDEA properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of these operators in the same manner or to the same extent as a triple-net tenant. Other non-reportable segment At December\u00a031, 2022, we had the following investments in our other non-reportable segments: (i) our unconsolidated joint venture with a sovereign wealth fund that owns 19 senior housing assets (which we refer to as our SWF SH JV), (ii) loans receivable, and (iii) marketable debt securities.  The properties in our SWF SH JV are owned through RIDEA structures and include independent living facilities and assisted living facilities, which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs. These facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Competition  Investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment companies, pension funds, private equity investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers, and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater flexibility (e.g., non-REIT competitors), greater resources, and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition and resulting capitalization rate compression make it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives. Our ability to compete may also be impacted by global, national, and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation, and population trends. Income from our investments depends on our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 ability to compete with other companies on multiple levels, including: (i) the quality of care provided, (ii) reputation, (iii) success of product or drug development, (iv) price, (v) the range of services offered, (vi) the physical appearance of a facility, (vii) alternatives for healthcare delivery, (viii) the supply of competing properties, (ix) physicians, (x) staff, (xi) referral sources, (xii) location, (xiii) the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas, and (xiv) the financial condition of our tenants and operators. For a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business, see \u201cItem\u00a01A, Risk Factors\u201d in this report. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Government Regulation, Licensing, and Enforcement  Overview Our healthcare facility operators (which include our TRS entities when we use a RIDEA structure) and tenants are subject to extensive and complex federal, state, and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care, licensure and certificate of need, resident rights (including abuse and neglect), consumer protection, government reimbursement, fraud and abuse practices, and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities. We expect the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management, and provision of services, among others. Federal, state, and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws and regulations. In addition, our operators are subject to a variety of laws, regulations, and executive orders relating to operators\u2019 response to the Covid pandemic, which can vary based on the provider type and jurisdiction, complicating compliance efforts. These regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions, including enhanced or additional penalties, sanctions, and other adverse actions that may arise under new regulations adopted in response to Covid. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies, and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws, regulations, reimbursement enforcement activity, and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under \u201cItem 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this report. The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us. Fraud and Abuse Enforcement There are various extremely complex U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers\u2019 referrals, relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include: (i) U.S. federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other U.S. federal or state healthcare programs; (ii) U.S. federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services; (iii) U.S. federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the \u201cStark Law\u201d), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship; and (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services. Violations of U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, payment suspensions, and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state, and local agencies and in the U.S. can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d actions. Our tenants and operators that participate in government reimbursement programs are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions or whistleblower actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws. Additionally, the licensed operators of our U.S. long-term care facilities that participate in government reimbursement programs are required to have compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations relating to the Social Security Act. Where we have used a RIDEA structure, we are dependent on management companies to fulfill our compliance obligations, and we have developed a program to periodically monitor compliance with such obligations. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Laws and Regulations Governing Privacy and Security There are various U.S. federal and state privacy laws and regulations, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (commonly referred to as \u201cHIPAA\u201d), that provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. An increasing focus of the U. S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (\u201cFTC\u2019s\u201d) consumer protection regulation is the impact of technological change on protection of consumer privacy. The FTC, as well as state attorneys general, have taken enforcement action against companies that do not abide by their representations to consumers regarding electronic security and privacy. To the extent we or our affiliated operating entities are a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the \u201cHITECH Act\u201d), compliance with those requirements require us to, among other things, conduct a risk analysis, implement a risk management plan, implement policies and procedures, and conduct employee training. In most cases, we are dependent on our tenants and management companies to fulfill our compliance obligations, and we have developed a program to periodically monitor compliance with such obligations. Because of the far reaching nature of these laws, there can be no assurance we would not be required to alter one or more of our systems and data security procedures to be in compliance with these laws. Our failure to protect health information could subject us to civil or criminal liability and adverse publicity, and could harm our business and impair our ability to attract new customers and residents. We may be required to notify individuals, as well as government agencies and the media, if we experience a data breach. Reimbursement Sources of revenue for some of our tenants and operators include, among others, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal Medicare programs and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental third-party payors, such as insurance carriers and HMOs. Our tenants and operators who participate in governmental healthcare programs are subject to government reviews, audits, and investigations to verify compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators. Governmental healthcare programs are highly regulated and are subject to frequent and substantial legislative, regulatory, and interpretive changes, which could adversely affect reimbursement rates and the method and timing of payment under these programs. Additionally, new and evolving payor and provider programs in the U.S., including Medicare Advantage, Dual Eligible, Accountable Care Organizations, Post-Acute Care Payment Models, SNF Value-Based Purchasing Programs, and Bundled Payments could adversely impact our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need Certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive national, federal, state, and local licensure, certification, and inspection laws and regulations. A healthcare facility\u2019s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a revocation, suspension, restriction, or non-renewal of the facility\u2019s license and loss of a certificate of need, which could adversely affect the facility\u2019s operations and ability to bill for items and services provided at the facility. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances (including narcotics), operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials, and operate equipment. Many states in the U.S. require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion, or closure of certain healthcare facilities. The approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact the ability of some of our tenants and operators to expand or change their businesses. Product Approvals While our life science tenants include some well-established companies, other tenants are less established and, in some cases, may not yet have a product approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or other regulatory authorities, for commercial sale. Creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital, in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry. It also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance. Entrance Fee Communities Our CCRCs are operated as entrance fee communities. Generally, an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident, a portion of which may be refundable, in exchange for some form of long-term benefit, typically consisting of a right to receive certain personal or health care services. In certain states (including the ones in which we operate) entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility\u2019s financial condition, establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions, the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time, the right of residents to receive a refund of their entrance fees, lien rights in favor of the residents, restrictions on change of ownership, and similar matters. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. To date, we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ADA that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ADA concerns. Should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is an ongoing one, and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect. Environmental Matters A wide variety of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines, personal or property damages, and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property and/or the assets. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the value of such property and the owner\u2019s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral, which, in turn, could reduce our earnings. For a description of the risks associated with environmental matters, see \u201cItem 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this report. Insurance  We obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property, business interruption, liability, flood, windstorm, earthquake, fire, environmental, and terrorism-related losses. We attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms, conditions, limits, and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage, and current industry practice. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war or other events, that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. In addition, we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake, flood, and windstorm occurrences, which carry higher deductibles. We maintain property insurance for all of our properties. Tenants under triple-net leases are required to provide primary property, business interruption, and liability insurance. We maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our CCRCs and the senior housing facilities owned by our SWF SH JV. Additionally, our corporate general liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned. We periodically review whether we or our RIDEA operators will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable CCRCs and senior housing facilities owned by our SWF SH JV, but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties, regardless of who maintains the insurance. We also maintain directors and officers liability insurance, which provides protection for claims against our directors and officers arising from their responsibilities as directors and officers. Such insurance also extends to us in certain situations.  Sustainability  We believe that environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) initiatives are a vital part of corporate responsibility, which supports our primary goal of increasing stockholder value through profitable growth.

Our Board of Directors oversees ESG matters, with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee overseeing sustainability and corporate governance matters, the Audit Committee overseeing risk management, and the Compensation and Human Capital Committee overseeing human capital management. We use an integrated approach to ESG throughout our business to identify risks and opportunities, capture efficiencies and cost savings, and report on the issues most relevant to stakeholders. 10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Environment: Our environmental management programs strive to make our buildings more sustainable and capture cost efficiencies that ultimately benefit our investors, employees, tenants, business partners, and other stakeholders, while reducing our carbon footprint and providing a positive impact on the communities in which we operate.

Human Capital Matters  Our employees represent our greatest asset, and as of December\u00a031, 2022, we had 199 full-time employees. Our Board of Directors, through its Compensation and Human Capital Committee, retains oversight of human capital management, including corporate culture, diversity, inclusion, talent acquisition, retention, employee satisfaction, engagement, and succession planning. We report on human capital matters at each regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting and periodically throughout the year. The most significant human capital measures or objectives that we focus on in managing our business and our related human capital initiatives include the following:  \u2022Workforce Diversity: We believe we are a stronger organization when our workforce represents a diversity of ideas and experiences. We value and embrace diversity in our employee recruiting, hiring, and development practices. Our workforce was made up of 46% female employees and 37% racially or ethnically diverse employees as of December\u00a031, 2022. Through our We Stand Together initiative, we launched numerous initiatives to help further our commitment to enhancing racial diversity and awareness, including augmenting recruiting practices to hire more diverse talent; implementing diversity, equity and inclusion training for senior leadership and employees; and sponsoring community outreach programs that support the education of underrepresented groups. 11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Inclusion and Belonging: We promote a work environment that emphasizes respect, fairness, inclusion, and dignity.
