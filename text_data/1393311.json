General Discussion of our Business Public Storage (referred to herein as the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d), a Maryland real estate investment trust that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d), was organized in 1980. Our principal business activities include the ownership, development, and operation of self-storage facilities and other related operations including tenant reinsurance and third-party self-storage management. We are the industry leading owner and operator of self-storage properties, with the most recognized brand in the self-storage industry, including our ubiquitous orange color. Self-storage Operations: We acquire, develop, own, and operate self-storage facilities, which offer storage spaces for lease on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use. We are the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d), with physical presence in most major markets and 40 states. We believe our scale, brand name, and technology platform afford us competitive advantages. At December\u00a031, 2022, we held interests in and consolidated 2,869 self-storage facilities (an aggregate of 204 million net rentable square feet of space) operating under the Public Storage\u00ae name. 1 1 1   Other Operations: We manage insurance programs whereby customers at our facilities, including those we manage for third parties, have the option of purchasing insurance from a non-affiliated insurance company to cover certain losses to their stored goods. A wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of Public Storage fully reinsures these policies and thereby assumes all risk of losses under the policies. This subsidiary receives from the non-affiliated insurance company reinsurance premiums substantially equal to the premiums collected from our tenants. These policies cover claims for losses related to specified events up to a maximum limit of $5,000 per storage unit. We reinsure all risks in this program but purchase insurance from an independent third party insurer to cover this exposure for a limit of $15.0 million for losses in excess of $5.0 million per occurrence. At December\u00a031, 2022, there were approximately 1.2 million certificates of insurance held by our self-storage customers, representing aggregate coverage of approximately $5.6 billion. At December\u00a031, 2022, we managed 114 facilities for third parties, and were under contract to manage 78 additional facilities including 73 facilities that are currently under construction. In addition, we sell merchandise, primarily locks and cardboard boxes at our self-storage facilities. We hold a 35% interest in Shurgard Self Storage Limited (\u201cShurgard\u201d). Shurgard is a public company traded on Euronext Brussels under the \u201cSHUR\u201d symbol. At December\u00a031, 2022, Shurgard owned and operated 266 self-storage facilities (15 million net rentable square feet) located in seven countries in Western Europe under the Shurgard\u00ae name. We previously held a significant equity interest in PS Business Parks, Inc. (\u201cPSB\u201d), which we sold in July 2022 in connection with PSB\u2019s merger with an unaffiliated third party. For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). For each taxable year in which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our \u201cREIT taxable income\u201d (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain) that is distributed to our shareholders. We believe we met these requirements in all periods presented herein and we expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. We file annually with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, which include consolidated financial statements certified by our independent registered public accountants. We also file quarterly with the SEC quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which include unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue such reporting. On our website, www.publicstorage.com, we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form\u00a010-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, definitive proxy statements, and other reports required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC, as well as all supplements and amendments to those filings, as soon as reasonably practicable after the filings, supplements, and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information contained on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K. Competition Ownership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 9% of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 20%, with the remaining 80% owned by regional and local operators. We believe our Public Storage\u00ae brand awareness, as well as our digital customer experience described below, provide us with a competitive advantage in acquiring and retaining customers relative to other self-storage operators. The high level of ownership fragmentation in the industry is partially attributable to the relative simplicity of managing a local self-storage facility, such that small-scale owners can operate self-storage facilities at a basic level of profitability without significant managerial or operational infrastructure. Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators, who use marketing channels, including Internet advertising, signage, and banners, and offer services similar to ours. As a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income, and operating expenses of our facilities. However, we believe that the economies of scale inherent in this business result in our being able to operate self-storage facilities at a materially higher level of cash flow per square foot than other operators without our scale.  2 2 2   Technology We believe technology enables revenue optimization and cost efficiencies. Over the past few years we have invested in additional technologies that we believe have enabled us to operate and compete more effectively by providing customers with an enhanced digital experience. Convenient shopping experience: Customers can conveniently shop for available storage space, reviewing attributes such as facility location, size, amenities (such as climate-control), and pricing through the following marketing channels: \u2022Our Website: The online marketing channel is a key source of customers. Approximately 79% of our move-ins in 2022 were sourced through our website and we believe that many of our other customers who reserved directly through our customer care center or arrived at a facility and moved in without a reservation, have reviewed our pricing and availability online through our website. We seek to update the structure, layout, and content of our website regularly in order to enhance our placement in \u201cunpaid\u201d search in Google and related websites, to improve the efficiency of our bids in \u201cpaid\u201d search campaigns, and to maximize users\u2019 likelihood of reserving space on our website. \u2022Our Customer Care Center: Our customer care center is staffed by skilled sales specialists and customer service representatives. Customers reach our customer care center by calling our advertised toll-free telephone numbers provided on search engines, from our website, the Public Storage App, or from our in-store kiosks. We believe giving customers the option to interact with a live agent, despite the higher marginal cost relative to a reservation made on our website, enhances our ability to close sales with potential customers and results in greater satisfaction. We also have live Internet chat capability as another channel for our customers to engage our agents, cost effectively improving customer responsiveness. \u2022Our Properties: Customers can also shop for available space at any one of our facilities. Property managers access the same information that is available on our website and to our customer care center agents and can inform the customer of available space at that site or at our other nearby storage facilities. Property managers are trained to maximize the conversion of such \u201cwalk in\u201d shoppers into customers. We are expanding the use of in-store kiosks to give customers the options of a full self-service experience or a two-way video assisted service via our existing customer care center. eRental\u00ae move-in process: To further enhance the move-in experience, we offer our eRental\u00ae process whereby prospective tenants (including those who initially reserved a space) are able to execute their rental agreement from their smartphone or computer and then go directly to their space on the move-in date. More than half of customers utilized our eRental\u00ae process during 2022. Public Storage App: We maintain an industry leading customer smartphone application. The Public Storage App provides our customers with digital access to our properties, as well as payment and other account management functions. Centralized information network: Our centralized reporting and information network enables us to identify changing market conditions and operating trends and analyze customer data. Our network allows us to quickly change each of our individual property\u2019s pricing and promotions, and drive marketing spending, such as the relative level of bidding for various paid search terms on paid search engines. Growth and Investment Strategies Our ongoing growth strategies consist of: (i) improving the operating performance of our existing self-storage facilities, (ii) acquiring and developing facilities, and (iii) growing ancillary business activities including tenant reinsurance and third-party management services. While our long-term strategy includes each of these elements, in the short term the level of growth in our asset base in any period is dependent upon the cost and availability of capital, as well as the relative attractiveness of available investment alternatives. Improve the operating performance of existing facilities: We regularly update and enhance our strategies to increase the net cash flow of our existing self-storage facilities through maximizing revenues and controlling operating costs. We maximize revenues through striking the appropriate balance between occupancy and rates to new and existing  3 3 3   tenants by regularly adjusting (i) our promotional and other discounts, (ii) the rental rates we charge to new and existing customers, and (iii) our marketing spending and intensity. We inform these pricing and marketing decisions by observing their impact on web and customer care center traffic, reservations, move-ins, move-outs, tenant length of stay, and other indicators of response. The size and scope of our operations have enabled us to achieve high operating margins and a low level of administrative costs relative to revenues through the centralization of many functions, such as facility maintenance, employee compensation and benefits programs, revenue management, and the development and documentation of standardized operating procedures. Acquire existing properties: We seek to capitalize on the fragmentation of the self-storage industry through acquiring attractively priced, well-located existing self-storage facilities. We believe our presence in and knowledge of substantially all of the major markets in the U.S. enhances our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Data on the rental rates and occupancy levels of our existing facilities provide us an advantage in evaluating the potential of acquisition opportunities. Our aggressiveness in bidding for particular marketed facilities depends upon many factors including the potential for future growth, the quality of construction and location, the cash flow we expect from the facility when operated on our platform, how well the facility fits into our current geographic footprint, and our return on capital expectations. Develop new self-storage facilities and expand existing facilities: The development of new self-storage locations and the expansion of existing facilities has been an important source of our growth. Our operating experience in major markets and experience in stabilizing new properties provides us advantages in developing new facilities. We plan to increase our development activity when we identify attractive risk adjusted return profiles with yields above those of acquisitions. However, our level of development is dependent upon many factors, including the cost and availability of land, the cost and availability of construction materials and labor, zoning and permitting limitations, our cost of capital, the cost of acquiring facilities relative to developing new facilities, and local demand and economic conditions. Grow ancillary business activities: We pursue growth initiatives aimed at increasing our insurance offering coverage for tenants who choose to protect their stored items against loss and desire to maximize their storage experience. As we grow our self-storage portfolio we have the opportunity to increase the growth profile of our tenant reinsurance business. Our third party management business enables us to generate revenues through management fees, expand our presence, increase our economies of scale, promote our brand, and enhance our ability to acquire additional facilities over the medium and long-term as a result of strategic relationships forged with third-party owners. Compliance with Government Regulations We are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including various federal, state, and local regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property and the operation of self-storage facilities. These include various laws and regulations concerning environmental matters, labor matters, and employee safety and health matters. Further, our insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with certain federal regulations. We are committed to a long-term environmental stewardship program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment and the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns, including environmentally-friendly capital initiatives and building and operating properties with high structural resilience and low obsolescence. We accrue environmental assessments and estimated remediation costs when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. Our current practice is to conduct environmental investigations in connection with property acquisitions. Although there can be no assurance, we are not aware of any environmental contamination of any of our facilities that individually or in the aggregate would be material to our overall business, financial condition, or results of operations. Refer to Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d below for a discussion of certain risks related to government regulations, including risks related to environmental regulations, emergency regulations adopted in response to wildfires, flooding, or public health crises that restrict access to our facilities or the rents we can charge our customers, wage regulations, income tax regulations including relating to REIT qualification, and property tax regulations.  4 4 4   Aside from the regulations discussed therein, we are not aware of any government regulations that have resulted or that we expect will result in compliance costs that had or will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.   Human Capital Resources Our employees are the foundation of our business and fundamental to our ability to execute our corporate strategies and build long-term value for our stakeholders.  In order to maintain a strong foundation, our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop, and retain the highest quality talent.  We achieve these objectives by committing to our employees to provide a diverse and inclusive workplace, regular and open communication, competitive and supportive compensation and benefits programs, and opportunities for career growth and development.  Together with our core values of doing the right thing and integrity in all that we do, which serve as the cornerstone of our corporate culture, we believe that this commitment facilitates employee engagement and their commitment to Public Storage.  We have approximately 5,900 employees, including 5,090 customer facing roles (such as property level and customer care center personnel), 380 field management employees, and 430 employees in our corporate operations. The following is an overview of our key programs and initiatives focused on attracting, developing, and retaining the highest quality talent: Diversity and Inclusion We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse workplace where all employees feel valued, included, and excited to be part of a best-in-class team.  Our employees come from all different races, backgrounds, and life experiences, and we celebrate inclusion and value the diversity each person brings to Public Storage.  Our commitment to diversity and inclusion makes us a stronger company and instills a sense of pride across our teams as we serve our customers. In 2021, our Chief Executive Officer signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge, reflecting our commitment to foster an environment where everyone feels valued and included. This commitment extends not just throughout Public Storage but across the real estate industry. In this regard, in 2022, we made a founding donor contribution to the Nareit Dividends through Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Giving Campaign, which is directed at taking actionable and sustainable measures that support the recruitment, inclusion, development, and advancement of women, black professionals, other people of color, ethnically diverse individuals, and members of other under-represented groups in REITs and the publicly traded real estate industry.   Public Storage hires based on skills, personality, and experience, without regard to age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristic. We maintain policies regarding diversity, equal opportunity, pay-for-performance, discrimination, harassment, and labor (including opposition to child, forced, and compulsory labor).  We also maintain a policy of requiring that diverse candidate slates be considered for all director positions and above. Adherence to our practice of hiring \u201cthe best\u201d has fostered a diverse and inclusive employee base that reflects the diversity of the customers we serve.  Our commitment to diversity is evident at all levels of the organization. Additionally, by having a balanced mix of generations in the organization, we gain from the experiences each age group brings \u2013 our employees are 9% Boomer, 38% Gen X, 36% Gen Y and 17% Gen Z.  We publicly disclose our annual Consolidated EEO-1 report, which reflects the race, ethnicity, and gender composition of our workforce, on the Investor Relations section of our website.  5 5 5   Communication and Engagement Given the geographically dispersed nature of our business, regular and clear communication is critical to ensuring that employees feel informed, included, and engaged. We communicate through various channels, including email communications, a monthly newsletter and town halls, where we provide employees company strategy and performance updates, employee recognitions and other information and the opportunity to ask questions of our leaders. In order to better understand the effectiveness of our engagement strategies, we conduct various surveys that measure employee commitment, motivation, and engagement, and solicit employee feedback that helps us improve.  In 2022, 85% of our employees participated in our employee engagement survey, an increase from 80% in 2021, and we achieved employee engagement of 76%. We are committed to continuous listening and improvement for our employees, and our feedback tools have guided enhancements for our employees, including the development of additional career progression opportunities and enhancements to our employee compensation and benefits programs. We believe that the success of our engagement strategies can also be seen through third party surveys and recognition. Among other recognitions, we are proud to be named in 2022 a Great Place to Work\u00ae and included on the 2022 Forbes and Statista \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Large Employers\u201d award list. We have also been recognized by Comparably, Inc. as a \u201cChoice Employer\u201d with an \u201cA+\u201d Culture Score based on employee responses across 18 culture metrics, among other recognitions. Compensation, Health, Wellness, and Safety Public Storage maintains compensation and benefits programs designed to incentivize, reward, and support our employees. We believe in aligning employee compensation with our short- and long-term performance goals and providing the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate, and retain employees who are crucial to our success. We tailor our compensation programs to each employee group to ensure competitiveness in the market and to drive employee engagement. We are committed to the total well-being of all our employees and provide resources to help support them in times of need along with access to targeted solutions to help them achieve their personal and financial goals. We provide affordable health plans and programs to virtually all our employees. Anyone working 20 hours or more is eligible to participate in our health benefit offerings, which include medical, dental, vision, flexible and health savings accounts, discount programs, and income protection plans. We also offer a 401(k) plan with generous matching employer contributions to help our employees prepare for retirement. In addition to these programs, we maintain various employee support programs, including access to counseling, life planning tools, and discount programs for fitness, legal services, and home, auto, and pet insurance. Finally, we offer a range of educational tools and resources, including a dedicated health and wellness website, to help empower our employees to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle. We are committed to providing safe self-storage facilities for our customers and employees.  We conduct monthly safety trainings at all of our properties and an annual safety training at our headquarters.  We did not have any fatal injuries in 2022 and we publicly disclose our employee health and safety data in our annual Sustainability Report. Training, Development, Growth, and Recognition We provide robust training and development programs across all levels of Public Storage that are intended to provide our employees with the skills, tools, and knowledge they need to not only grow as individuals but also contribute to the value of the organization through strong engagement. Most new hires join us as property managers without any experience in the self-storage industry. We provide a hands-on new hire training program that provides close coaching and development. All new hires in leadership roles complete property-level training that gives them a hands-on view of our day-to-day operations at our properties to provide our leaders with an understanding of the fundamentals of our business and operations. We also provide numerous career development opportunities for existing employees across Public Storage, including management training programs. Many of our training and career development programs leverage our online learning platform of training courses and reference materials.  Public Storage employees completed over 430,000 formal training hours in 2022. In addition to formal training programs, we also offer a variety of one-on-one coaching, job shadowing, and mentoring programs.  6 6 6   Performance Management and Succession Planning Our performance management processes are designed to be collaborative, where employees and management work together to plan, monitor, and review the employee\u2019s objectives and career aspirations and set short- and long-term goals to achieve outcomes.  This process is continual, with regular opportunities for management and employees to give and receive feedback. Succession planning is a top priority for management and our Board of Trustees (our \u201cBoard\u201d) to ensure business continuity.  Leaders at all levels review development opportunities, provide feedback, and facilitate career progression conversations on an ongoing basis to ensure that employees can reach their full potential. Additionally, in 2022, we began development of a new leadership accelerator program for women and diverse employees, which includes individual mentorship and hands-on experiences directed at further enhancing our bench of women and minority leaders and management succession planning. No less than annually, the executive teams meet to review succession bench strength, calibrate talent, and provide recommendations to prepare succession candidates for future leadership roles within the organization.  This broad and collaborative approach to talent management works to ensure opportunities are made available to employees to grow outside of their current function and responsibilities. Climate Change and Environmental Stewardship We are committed to managing climate-related risks and opportunities. This commitment is a key component of our recognition that we must operate in a responsible and sustainable manner that aligns with our long-term corporate strategy and promotes our best interests along with those of our stakeholders, including our customers, investors, employees, and the communities in which we do business. Our management Environmental, Social, and Governance Steering Committee (our \u201cSustainability Committee\u201d) guides our commitment to sustainability and has primary responsibility for climate-related activities. The Sustainability Committee reports to our Board and its Committees, which oversee all of our sustainability initiatives. We consider potential environmental impacts\u2014both positive and negative\u2014in our decision making across the business. The following features of our properties reflect our commitment to responsible environmental stewardship: - Low environmental impact. Our property portfolio has an inherently light footprint. On average, one to two Public Storage employees operate each property at any given time, and our customers are only occasionally on-site because they do not work or reside there. As a result, our properties consume less energy, emit less carbon, use less water, and produce less waste relative to other real estate types. - Proactive Initiatives. Despite our light environmental footprint, we proactively strive to reduce our impact further through initiatives such as \u201con demand\u201d LED lighting, solar power generation, and low-water-use landscaping. These are environmentally friendly initiatives that also generate economic returns on invested capital. Additionally, we have recently partnered with The BRE Group to develop a green building certification program for self-storage facilities in the U.S. through its BREEAM\u00ae validation and certification system. - Low obsolescence. Our properties have retained functional and physical usefulness over many decades. In fact, many customers favor our single-story, drive-up properties built in the 1970s and 1980s due to their central locations and accessibility. This contrasts with other real estate types that require frequent reinvestment (i.e., capital expenditures) to stay current with consumer preference, remain competitive with newer competition, offset heavier wear-and-tear by users, and maintain structural operating efficiency. - High structural resilience. We build and operate our properties to withstand the test of time, including general aging and acute and chronic risks from rising water levels, changing temperatures, and natural disasters. We measure and monitor our environmental impact and leverage sustainability measures to reduce this impact while achieving cost efficiencies in our operations by implementing a range of energy, water, and waste management initiatives. Many of these initiatives are integrated into our ongoing Property of Tomorrow capital investment program. In regard to climate, we assess risks and opportunities in conjunction with ongoing operating and risk management processes across the company. We give primary consideration to physical, regulatory, legal, market, and  7 7 7   reputational risks. Examples of these risks include heat/water stress, natural disasters, pandemics, temperature change, and regulatory compliance. We are addressing potential heat stress risks (e.g., higher energy costs, more frequent power outages, and impacts on our customers and workforce) through initiatives such as converting to LED lighting, solar power generation installation, and analyzing battery storage and microgrids. We are addressing potential water stress risks (e.g., increased costs and decreased availability) through initiatives such as efficient plumbing systems, low-water use irrigation systems, drought tolerant and native landscaping, water run-off controls, and storm water retention. We address the remaining risks primarily through natural disaster resilient development, redevelopment, and capital expenditures. We will continue to utilize our unique competitive advantages in furthering our environmental stewardship efforts and addressing the effects of climate change. Our commitment includes:  \u2022expanding our greenhouse gas emissions inventory to include Scopes 1, 2, and 3 for the entire portfolio; \u2022analyzing opportunities to work with our vendors and suppliers on emissions; \u2022enhancing our internal processes and controls in anticipation of forthcoming SEC climate disclosure rules; \u2022evaluating the feasibility of instituting well-founded medium and/or long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets or other science-based, climate-focused targets in a manner aligned with the ambitious carbon reduction goals of the Paris Climate Agreement; \u2022continuing to enhance our environmental management system to further infuse sustainability across our organization, enhance our program, and bolster the results of our sustainability efforts; \u2022continuing to provide regular updates to our stakeholders on our ongoing efforts through our annual Sustainability Report; and \u2022continuing publicly to disclose detailed information on our greenhouse gas emissions (consistent with TCFD standards), including through the Carbon Disclosure Project, as well as information on energy and water usage, green energy generation, and similar metrics. Our annual Sustainability Report, which details our commitment to environmental stewardship along with our results, performance and progress, is accessible on our website at www.publicstorage.com.  Cybersecurity Public Storage devotes significant resources to protecting and continuing to improve the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets. Our security efforts are designed to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of all information owned by, or in the care of, the Company and protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, or cause other damage. Board Oversight Our Board considers cybersecurity risk one of the most significant risks to our business. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks affecting the Company. The Audit Committee periodically evaluates our cybersecurity strategy to ensure its effectiveness. Management provides quarterly reports to the Audit Committee regarding cybersecurity and other information technology risks, and the Audit Committee in turn provides reports to the full Board. As part of our Board refreshment efforts in recent years, we have focused on adding trustees with information technology skills. Currently, ten members of our Board, including all four members of our Audit Committee, have cybersecurity experience from their principal occupation or other professional experience. In addition, several members of our Audit Committee have attended third-party director education courses on cybersecurity since 2021, including cyber risk governance, and privacy issues and trends.  8 8 8   Cybersecurity Risk Identification and Management A dedicated team of technology professionals works throughout the year to monitor all matters of risk relating to cybersecurity. Our Chief Technology Officer and our Vice President, Management Information Systems, oversee our information security program and report to our executive management team through our Chief Administrative Officer. Their teams are responsible for leading enterprise-wide cyber resilience strategy, policy, standards, architecture, and processes. We identify and address information security risks by employing a defense-in-depth methodology, consisting of both proactive and reactive elements, that provides multiple, redundant defensive measures and prescribes actions to take in case a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited. We leverage internal resources, along with strategic external partnerships, to mitigate cybersecurity threats to the Company. We have partnerships for Security Operations Center (SOC) services, penetration testing (PENTEST), incident response (IR), and various third-party assessments. We deploy both commercially available solutions and proprietary systems to manage threats to our information technology environment actively. Our cybersecurity oversight infrastructure is part of our internal control environment and our controls include information security standards. In addition, we are certified against top information security standards, specifically the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), to ensure we comply with this rigorous standard specifically for the safe handling and protection of credit card data. Annually, we are assessed, either internally or by an independent third-party, against the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework. We also have policies and procedures to oversee and identify the cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers, including the regular review of SOC reports, relevant cyber attestations, and other independent cyber ratings. These processes include technical controls and processes, as well as contractual mechanisms to mitigate risk. Additionally, throughout the year, we utilize reports prepared by our external partners, which provide an independent ranking of our cybersecurity maturity and coverage, to assess our cyber proficiency on an standalone basis and comparatively against peers and other companies. Our cyber proficiency consistently ranks as \u201cadvanced.\u201d We also regularly engage appropriate external resources regarding emerging threats to navigate the diverse cybersecurity landscape. In addition to ensuring adequate safeguards are in place to minimize the chance of a successful cyberattack, the Company has established well-defined response procedures to address any cyber event that may occur despite these robust safeguards. These response procedures are designed to identify, analyze, contain, and remediate such cyber incidents to ensure a timely, consistent, and compliant response to actual or attempted data incidents impacting the Company. Recently, the Company completed two separate Disaster Response and Business Continuity Plan exercises to validate our current readiness, and the Company devotes appropriate resources and enlists partners to adapt to the evolving threat landscape. Each year, the Company tests these response procedures, including through disaster response and business continuity plan exercises, in our continuous effort to adapt to the evolving threat landscape. These exercises are intended to challenge and validate our information security response and resources through simulated cybersecurity incidents, including engagement of outside cybersecurity legal counsel, other third party partners, executive management, and our Board.  The Company takes data protection seriously and ensures every employee understands their role in keeping Public Storage safe from cyber-attacks. We employ a robust information security and training program for our employees, including mandatory computer-based training, regular internal communications, and ongoing end-user testing to measure the effectiveness of our information security program. As part of this commitment, we require our employees to complete a Cybersecurity Awareness eCourse and acknowledge our Information Security policy each year. In addition, we have an established schedule and process for regular phishing awareness campaigns that are designed to emulate real-world contemporary threats and provide immediate feedback (and, if necessary, additional training or remedial action) to employees. We have experienced no material information security breaches in the last three years. As such, we have not spent any material amount of capital on addressing information security breaches in the last three years, nor have we incurred any material expenses from penalties and settlements related to a material breach during this same time. We believe we are adequately insured against losses related to a potential information security breach, and we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for the size and complexity of our business.  9 9 9   Seasonality We experience minor seasonal fluctuations in the demand for self-storage space, with demand and rental rates generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months. We believe that these fluctuations result in part from increased moving activity during the summer months. ", "time": "00:00:03"}
