{"cik": 1075531, "item_1A": "Item 1.\u00a0 Business  \u00a0 As most countries have emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic and removed travel restrictions, travelers have resumed exploring the world. We are proud that, despite challenges to our global community such as the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the impact of persistent inflation on consumers, and widespread travel disruptions at airports in North America and Europe, as well as the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our efforts to make our brands the most trusted and convenient platforms for consumers and partners, including:  \u2022surpassing pre-pandemic room nights for the first time in the second quarter; \u2022continuing to increase room nights and brand awareness in key markets such as the U.S.; \u2022launching Rooms for Refugees at Booking.com to assist those displaced by the war in Ukraine to book free and discounted rooms; \u2022improving our loyalty programs, particularly the Genius program at Booking.com, and increasing our focus on value for our consumers; \u2022improving and expanding visibility of our flight offering at Booking.com; \u2022increasing adoption of our payments platform and payments capabilities across the Company; and  \u2022expanding our Travel Sustainable program to more of our supply partners and across our relevant brands.   Our mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. Our services empower people to cut through travel barriers like money, time, language, and overwhelming options, to easily and confidently get where they want to go, stay where they want to stay, dine where they want to dine, pay how they want to pay, and experience what they want to experience. We connect consumers making travel reservations with travel service providers around the world through our online platforms. We offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable. We continue to optimize the collaboration and cooperation among our brands to provide consumers with the most comprehensive and useful services for their needs. The following table shows the key services we offer to consumers:   Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"BKNG.\"\u00a0We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands collectively as \"Booking Holdings,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us.\"  1 1 1    Our Business Model \u00a0 We derive substantially all of our revenues from providing online travel reservation services, which facilitate online travel purchases between travel service providers (which we generally refer to as \"partners\") and travelers (which we generally refer to as \"consumers\"). We also earn revenues from advertising services, restaurant reservations, and various other services, such as travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services for restaurants.  For the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, we had revenues of $17.1 billion, which we classify as \"agency\" revenues, \"merchant\" revenues, and \"advertising and other\" revenues.  \u2022Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided. Agency revenues consist almost entirely of travel reservation commissions from our accommodation, rental car, and airline reservation services. We invoice the travel service providers for our commissions after travel is completed. Substantially all of our agency revenue is from Booking.com's accommodation reservations.  \u2022Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided, generally at the time of booking. Merchant revenues include travel reservation commissions and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers, including the impact of merchandising, less the amount owed to travel service providers); credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees; and ancillary fees, including travel-related insurance revenues. The majority of our merchant revenue is from Booking.com's accommodation reservations.  \u2022Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from (a) revenues earned by KAYAK for sending referrals to online travel companies (\"OTCs\") and travel service providers and for advertising placements on its platforms and (b) revenues earned by OpenTable for its restaurant reservation services and subscription fees for restaurant management services.  Our Strategy \u00a0 We aim to demonstrate global leadership in online travel bookings and related services by:  \u2022making it easy for people to find, book, pay for, and experience travel throughout the world;  \u2022providing consumers with the most comprehensive choices and prices at any time, in any place, on any device; \u2022offering platforms, tools, and insights to our business partners to help them be successful; and \u2022operating our business sustainably and supporting sustainable travel choices by our consumers and partners.  We focus on relentless innovation and execution and a commitment to serve both consumers and partners with unmatched service and best-in-class technology. We believe that global travel bookings will generally continue to grow while shifting from traditional offline methods to online channels like ours, which is a trend we have observed throughout our company's history. We expect to benefit from this growth in travel and the continued shift to online channels as we work to expand our service offerings and increase our presence in key geographies. In particular, we seek to (a) leverage technology to provide consumers with the best experience, (b) partner with travel service providers and restaurants to our mutual benefit, (c) operate multiple brands that collaborate with each other, and (d) invest in profitable and sustainable growth.  Provide the best consumer experience.\u00a0We focus on providing consumers with: (a) intuitive, easy-to-use online travel services; (b) a comprehensive selection of travel and payment options; (c) informative and useful content, such as pictures, accommodation and restaurant details, reviews, and sustainability information; (d) excellent customer service; and (e) value through competitive prices, special rate programs, and loyalty programs. Our goal is to make travel easy, frictionless, and personal and to offer consumers the most value, trusted brands, and extensive, varied, and comprehensive travel choices in every geography. We believe that our work to build out our payments capabilities across the Company removes friction from the booking process and delivers additional value for travelers. We endeavor to provide excellent customer service in a variety of ways, including through call centers and online platforms and the use of chatbots and other technologies, so that consumers can be confident that booking reservations through us will be a positive experience.   We continue to innovate and invest in our services in order to meet the needs of our consumers and partners. We seek to grow our business through innovation by providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use websites and mobile apps and by building stronger relationships with our consumers and partners. An increasing percentage of our room  2 2 2   nights are booked on our mobile apps and in 2022 Booking.com\u2019s mobile app was the most downloaded online travel agency app globally and in the U.S. according to third-party research firm Apptopia. We continue to execute against our long-term strategy to build a seamless offering of multiple elements of travel, allowing us to provide a more tailored and flexible consumer experience, which we refer to as the \"Connected Trip.\" In the near term, we are focused on providing consumers the ability to build a complete travel itinerary on our platforms by, for example, enabling them to book a convenient taxi or rental car to coincide with their flight arrival or attractions near their accommodation, and developing travel wallet capabilities. In 2022, we continued to grow our flight offering at Booking.com, including expanding into over 50 countries by the end of the year. We expect that these developments will benefit our consumers and partners.  Partner with travel service providers and restaurants. We aim to establish mutually beneficial relationships with travel service providers and restaurants around the world. We believe they benefit from participating in our services by increasing their distribution channels, demand, profile and reputation, and inventory utilization in an efficient and cost-effective manner. They also benefit from our trusted brands and marketing efforts, expertise in offering an excellent consumer experience, and ability to offer their inventory in markets and to consumers that they may otherwise be unable or unlikely to reach, for instance due to language or payments services we can offer on their behalf.   Operate multiple brands. We operate multiple brands, which allows us to appeal to different consumers, pursue distinct marketing and business strategies, encourage experimentation and innovation, provide numerous service offerings, and focus on specific markets or geographies. We continue to optimize collaboration among our brands to provide consumers with the most comprehensive and value-oriented services. We invest to support growth by our brands, whether through increased marketing, geographic expansion, technological innovation, or increased access to travel service offerings.   Invest in profitable and sustainable growth. We seek to offer online services that meet the needs and the expectations of consumers and partners and that we believe will result in mutual long-term profitability and growth. We have made significant investments in people, technology, marketing, and added or expanded services, such as improving the selection of our accommodations, flights, and ground transportation offerings. In 2022, we continued to scale our flight offerings to more markets, and offer payments solutions to more consumers and partners. We continue to seek to maximize the benefits of our scale by sharing resources and technological innovations among our brands and co-developing new services. For example, we expanded our Travel Sustainable program across relevant Booking Holdings brands in 2022 with more than 400,000 accommodations recognized globally with our Travel Sustainable badge as of December 31, 2022. We also regularly evaluate, and may pursue, potential strategic acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, or investments as part of our long-term business strategy.   Service Offerings  Booking.com and Rentalcars.com.\u00a0Booking.com is the world's leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations, based on room nights booked, with operations worldwide and headquarters in the Netherlands. At December\u00a031, 2022, Booking.com offered accommodation reservation services for approximately 2.7 million properties in over 220 countries and territories and in over 40 languages, consisting of over 400,000 hotels, motels, and resorts and 2.3 million homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay.   In 2022, Booking.com significantly expanded its flight offering to 54 markets and in-destination tours and activities to more than 1,200 cities around the world. Rentalcars.com operates as part of Booking.com and offers online rental car reservation services in over 52,000 locations throughout the world, with customer support in over 40 languages. Booking.com and Rentalcars.com also offer pre-booked taxi and black car services at over 1,600 airports throughout the world.   Priceline. Priceline is a leader in the discount travel reservation business, offering online travel reservation services primarily in North America, with headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut. Priceline offers consumers hotel, flight, activity, and rental car reservation services, as well as vacation packages, cruises, and hotel distribution services for partners and affiliates.  Agoda. Agoda is a leading online accommodation reservation service catering primarily to consumers in the Asia-Pacific region, with headquarters in Singapore and operations in Bangkok, Thailand, and elsewhere. Agoda also offers flight, ground transportation, and activities reservation services.  \u00a0KAYAK. KAYAK, headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, provides online meta-search services that allow consumers to easily search and compare travel itineraries and prices, including airline ticket, accommodation reservation, and rental car reservation information from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. KAYAK offers its services in over 60 countries, with its largest market in the United States, through various websites including momondo, Cheapflights, and HotelsCombined. 3 3 3    OpenTable. OpenTable is a leading brand for booking online restaurant reservations. With significant operations in San Francisco, California, OpenTable provides online restaurant reservation services to consumers and reservation management services to restaurants, primarily in the United States.  Marketing and Brand Awareness \u00a0 We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns, particularly strategic use of performance marketing spend. We invest resources in marketing and other brand building to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands.   Competition \u00a0 We compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving, and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can and do launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon, Uber, and Meta, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and financial and other resources than we do, and may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google\u2019s online travel offerings have grown rapidly in this area by linking travel search services to its dominant search functionality through flight, hotel, and alternative accommodations meta-search products, and by integrating its hotel meta-search products and restaurant information and reservation products into its Google Maps app.   We currently, or may in the future, compete with a variety of companies, including:   \u2022online travel or restaurant reservation services and meta-search services;  \u2022large online search, social networking, and marketplace companies;  \u2022travel service providers (e.g., accommodations, rental car companies, or airlines) that have their own branded online platforms to which they drive business;  \u2022traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers, and tour operators; and  \u2022companies offering technology services and software solutions to travel service providers.  For more information regarding current and potential competitors and the competitive nature of the markets in which we operate, please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Government Regulation   Our ability to provide our services and any future services is affected by legal regulations of national and local governments and regulatory authorities around the world, many of which are evolving and subject to new or revised interpretations. Violations of any laws or regulations could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, and prohibitions on how or where we conduct or propose to conduct our business. They could also delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and materially damage our reputation, brands, global expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain employees and business partners, business, and operating results. Even if we comply with these laws and regulations, doing business in certain jurisdictions or violations of these laws and regulations by the parties with which we conduct business runs the risk of harming our reputation and our brands, which could adversely affect our results of operations or stock price. Regulations that impact our business or our industry include:  \u2022Data Protection and Privacy: We have established and continue to maintain policies and a global governance framework to comply with laws that apply to our business, meet evolving stakeholder expectations, and support business innovation and growth. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") imposes significant compliance obligations and costs. In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\") and the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\") impose privacy requirements and rights for consumers in California that will result in additional compliance complexity, risks, and costs. Many other U.S. states and jurisdictions globally have adopted or may adopt similar data protection regulations. Some data protection and privacy  4 4 4   laws afford consumers a private right of action against companies like ours for certain statutory violations. In many cases, data protection and privacy laws restrict the transfers of information among our subsidiaries, including employee information.  \u2022Competition, Consumer Protection and Online Commerce: Competition and consumer protection laws and regulations impact various aspects of our business. There is significant legislative and public focus on large technology companies, including in relation to the regulation of digital platforms. The Digital Markets Act (\"DMA\") and Digital Services Act (\"DSA\") give regulators in the EU more instruments to investigate and regulate digital businesses and impose new rules and requirements on platforms designated as \"gatekeepers\" under the DMA and online platforms more generally, with separate rules for \"Very Large Online Platforms\" (\"VLOPs\") under the DSA. If the European Commission determines that we are a gatekeeper or one of our brands is a VLOP, we will be subject to additional rules and regulations that may not be applicable to our competitors.  \u2022Regulation of the Travel Industry: Our business could be impacted by travel-related regulations such as local regulation of the use of alternative accommodations. In addition, in response to the significant increase in travelers in 2022, local jurisdictions and tourist destinations around the world have instituted a variety of measures to address the issues of \"overtourism\" and the impact of tourism on climate. As our business evolves, we expect to become subject to existing and new regulations. For example, some parts of our business are already subject to certain requirements of the EU Package Travel Directive (the \"Package Directive\"), and as our offerings continue to diversify and expand, we may become subject to additional requirements of the Package Directive. \u2022Payments: As we expand our payments services to consumers and business partners, we are subject to additional regulations, such as financial services regulations and license requirements, which has resulted in increased compliance costs and complexities, including those associated with the implementation of new or more stringent internal controls. We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with payment card processors, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, compliance with which is complex and costly.  For further discussion of these regulations and how other global regulations may impact our business, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"Information Security, Cybersecurity, and Data Privacy Risks\" and \"Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, and Reputational Risks.\"  Technology \u00a0 Our business is supported by multiple systems and platforms, which were designed with an emphasis on scalability, performance, reliability, redundancy, and security. Our software systems, platforms, and architecture use a variety of widely-used software tools and database systems. We are modernizing our technology by building new applications with modern development tools and application programming interfaces and increasingly rely upon public cloud infrastructure for certain systems and data.  These internal systems and platforms are designed to include open application protocol interfaces that can provide connectivity to vendors in the industries in which we operate. These include large global systems, such as accommodation, flight, and rental car reservation systems, and financial service providers, as well as individual accommodation service providers, such as independent hotels. Our applications utilize digital certificates and other security technologies to help us conduct secure communications and transactions, as appropriate. The systems infrastructure and web and database servers of our worldwide operations are primarily hosted in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong, and multiple locations in the United States, each of which provides network connectivity, networking infrastructure, and 24-hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data centers. All data center facilities have a continuous power supply system, generators, redundant servers, and multiple back-up systems. Any system failure that causes an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation, damage our brands, increase customer service costs, or result in lost business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For further discussion of our technology and how it may impact our business, see Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors - \"Information Security, Cybersecurity, and Data Privacy Risks.\"   Intellectual Property \u00a0 We regard the protection of our intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on intellectual property such as trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets to support our business as well as domain names or other intangible rights or property secured through purchase, licensing or other agreements with employees, travel service providers, partners, and other parties. We have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we currently hold a number of issued patents in several jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"We face risks related to our intellectual property.\" 5 5 5    Seasonality and Other Timing Factors  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our gross bookings were generally similar in the first three quarters of the year and higher than in the fourth quarter. We generally recognize our marketing activities as the expense is incurred, which is typically in the quarter when the gross bookings for the associated reservations are recognized. However, we would generally recognize revenue from these bookings when the travel begins (at \"check-in\"), and accommodation check-ins in Europe and North America are generally highest in the third quarter during those regions' peak summer travel season and lowest in the first quarter. As a result of this timing difference between when we record marketing expense and when we generally recognize associated revenue, we typically experience our highest levels of profitability in the third quarter and our lowest level of profitability in the first quarter. In addition to the typical seasonality effects on our business, our quarterly results and quarterly year-over-year growth rates can be impacted by:  \u2022The length of the booking window (the average time between the booking of a travel reservation and when the travel begins), which impacts the relationship between our gross bookings (recognized at the time of booking) and our revenues (recognized at the time of check-in);  \u2022The level of acceleration or deceleration in the gross bookings growth rate. For example, our operating margins are typically negatively impacted in the near term from gross bookings and related variable marketing expense growth acceleration, as revenue growth is typically less impacted by accelerating gross bookings growth in the near term. Any such acceleration would positively impact revenue growth in subsequent periods as a portion of the revenue recognized from such gross bookings will occur in future quarters. Conversely, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit; and   \u2022The date on which certain holidays (e.g., Easter and Ramadan) fall.  The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the booking window of our business since its onset in 2020. For example, in 2022, we saw a shorter booking window than we saw in 2019, as an increased percentage of bookings were made for travel that was to occur close to the time of booking. However, in 2022, we saw the booking window expand compared to 2021. As the travel market continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see periods of gross bookings growth rate acceleration, which will likely result in periods where our operating margins are negatively impacted due to the timing difference of when marketing expense is recorded and when revenue is recognized.   Human Capital Resources  \u00a0 Our employees are fundamental to delivering on our mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. Our goal is to attract, develop, and retain highly-skilled talent with a significant focus on a diverse workforce operating in an inclusive environment. While the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant shift to office and remote working environments, we are committed to engaging with our employees across our Company and maintaining a productive workforce that is proud to work for Booking Holdings.  Workforce  Our Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee have oversight of our human capital management. We operate multiple brands to appeal to different consumers, pursue distinct marketing and business strategies, encourage experimentation and innovation, provide numerous service offerings, and focus on various markets. While we continue to optimize the collaboration among our brands, our structure often manifests in varied approaches to human capital management.   At December\u00a031, 2022, we employed approximately 21,600 employees, of which approximately 3,100 were based in the United States, and approximately 18,500 were based outside the United States. Approximately 99% of our employees are full-time employees. We also retain independent contractors, including to support our customer service, website content translation, and system support functions.   6 6 6   Employees by Geography (as of December\u00a031, 2022)    Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging  Our commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging means honoring all experiences, valuing all voices, and leading with empathy on our journey to become a more inclusive company. We believe that a diverse workforce operating in an inclusive environment is critical to leveraging our human capital to achieve our long-term strategic goals. We strive for our leadership and workforce to reflect the broad spectrum of customers and partners we work with throughout the world because we believe this is the best way for us to connect with the viewpoints, backgrounds, and experiences of our customers and partners. We are committed to creating workplaces that embrace and celebrate the different cultures and practices of our employees and we prohibit unlawful discrimination of any type.   As of December\u00a031, 2022, approximately 47% of our employees were women, approximately 25% of our technology positions were filled by women, and approximately 31% of leadership (which includes vice presidents and above for all brands except Booking.com, which includes senior directors and above due to a greater number of employees) were women. We are committed to pay equity, regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity. With the help of an independent compensation consultant, we conduct pay equity studies every other year, and in the off years, we work on remediation plans to address outliers.  Gender Diversity of Employees (as of December\u00a031, 2022)   While a significant percentage of our workforce is located in jurisdictions that may present challenges to tracking employee racial or ethnic demographics for legal reasons, we seek other ways to assess our employees' experience of inclusion. For example, all of our brands include diversity and inclusion questions in annual employee engagement surveys to gauge our inclusivity progress. We also publish our consolidated EEO-1 report for employees in the United States, although this represents only approximately 15% of our workforce as of December\u00a031, 2022.   We encourage equality and inclusivity across our workforce through various initiatives. As part of our recruitment efforts to ensure that candidate slates are diverse, we use diversity-focused sourcing platforms, we apply an inclusive language tool to job descriptions to attract historically underrepresented candidates, and we hold recruiters accountable for presenting multicultural candidates by tying it to their performance goals. In addition, we provide training to ensure interviewers consider all candidates objectively.  7 7 7    We have invested in a robust inclusive leadership training program and unconscious bias training for our leaders with plans to cascade these initiatives further into the organization to ensure that these tenets are core to our strategy. Additionally, we are entering our seventh year of operating our Women in Leadership program, which is a Company-wide initiative designed to support the advancement and development of high-performing women within our company with the goal of building and enabling gender diversity in our executive pipeline. We sponsor various employee resource groups to support the LGBTQ community and its allies, employees with differing physical and mental abilities, the Black and persons-of-color (POC) community, veteran employees, and gender equality. We are proud of the progress we have made in this space and recognize we can always improve.   Attraction, Development, and Retention  We work diligently to attract the best and most innovative talent from a wide range of sources to grow our business and achieve our long term strategic goals. We believe that we offer a rich culture where employees feel included and empowered to do their best work with opportunities to grow as well as competitive compensation and benefits. For example, while the specifics can vary by brand, in the United States our employee benefit plans generally include: coverage for infertility treatments, gender reassignment surgery, gender-neutral domestic partner benefits, and paid leave for new parents, those caring for a loved one, or bereavement.  We prioritize and invest in creating opportunities for employees to grow and build their careers through training and development programs. These include offering tailored learning opportunities to enable employees to upskill while at work and driving frequent career conversations between employees and their managers, as well as executive talent and succession planning.   Competition for talent in our industry has historically been intense. However, the proliferation of global working from anywhere policies and the associated increased ability for employees to seek out and switch jobs that may not have been accessible to them previously has heightened the competition for employees even further, particularly software engineers, mobile communications talent, and other technology professionals. As a result, the competition for talent in our industry combined with inflationary pressure on compensation has caused our expenses to attract and retain key talent to increase. We continue to focus on our employees\u2019 engagement and mental well-being, career satisfaction, development, and succession planning.   We recognize that expectations for the ways and places in which employees work have shifted dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Each of our brands has taken their own tailored approach to working policies that takes into account geographic location and the needs of current and prospective employees. A number of our brands have adopted more flexible work arrangements, including hybrid work from office and home flex programs.   We measure organizational culture and engagement so we can be responsive to our employees\u2019 needs. Taking into account employee feedback, our engagement efforts include regular communication touchpoints with the CEO and other senior leaders, virtual mental wellness workshops, and free access to a meditation app and telehealth services. We regularly connect with our employees through formal engagement surveys, work-from-home surveys, and quick pulse surveys to request feedback on the employee experience. The results of these efforts are shared with senior management at each of our brands who analyze areas of progress or prioritize areas for improvement in order to encourage and sustain employee engagement. We are proud that the results of our employee engagement surveys throughout 2022 broadly demonstrate a committed and engaged workforce.   Employee Relations  Although we have works councils or employee representatives in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We work in close collaboration with works councils, employee representatives, and other organizations in the relevant jurisdictions. We have never had a work stoppage and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.  \u00a0 For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"We rely on the performance of highly skilled employees; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key employees or hire, retain, and motivate well-qualified employees, our business would be harmed.\" \u00a0 8 8 8   Company Websites \u00a0 We maintain websites with the addresses www.bookingholdings.com, www.booking.com, www.priceline.com, www.agoda.com, www.rentalcars.com, www.kayak.com, and www.opentable.com, among others.
