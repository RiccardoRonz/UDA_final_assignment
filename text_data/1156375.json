{"cik": 1156375, "item_1A": "ITEM\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS CME Group provides market participants worldwide the ability to efficiently manage risk within and across multiple asset classes, by trading futures, options, cash and over-the-counter (OTC) products.  CME Group provides primary price discovery and referential pricing information through its market data in a variety of formats, including real time, historical and derived data for customers in both listed and cash products. CME Group also offers industry-leading research and analytics tools to provide customers with market education resources. GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS CME was founded in 1898 as a not-for-profit corporation. It established its clearing house in 1919, which is operated as part of  CME. CME demutualized in 2000, and in 2002 its parent company, CME Group, completed an initial public offering of its Class A common stock (Nasdaq: CME). CME Group subsequently acquired CBOT Holdings, Inc. in 2007, NYMEX Holdings, Inc. (NYMEX and COMEX) in 2008, the Kansas City Board of Trade in 2012 and NEX Group plc (NEX) in 2018. The combination with NEX expanded our global customer base and product offerings through the complementary combination of CME Group\u2019s exchange-traded derivative products and NEX\u2019s cash and OTC products. It also created a leading, client-centric, global markets company, generating capital efficiencies across futures, cash and OTC products for market participants seeking to lower their cost of trading and better manage risk. Our principal executive offices are located at 20 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606, our telephone number is 312-930-1000 and our website is cmegroup.com. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS CME Group exchanges offer the widest range of global benchmark products across interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange (FX), agricultural commodities, energy and metals. We also offer cash and repo fixed income trading via BrokerTec, and cash and OTC FX trading via EBS.  In addition, we operate one of the world\u2019s leading central counterparty clearing providers, CME Clearing, operated by CME.  Derivatives Exchange Business: Through our derivatives exchanges and clearing house, we believe our customers prefer CME Group's diversity of products, liquidity, price transparency and technological capabilities.  Market liquidity - or the ability of a market to absorb the execution of large purchases or sales quickly and efficiently - is key to attracting and retaining customers and contributing to a market's success. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculation and asset allocation related to the risks associated with, among other things, interest rate sensitive instruments, equity ownership, changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the prices of agricultural, energy and metal commodities. \u2022CME's product slate includes agricultural, equities, FX, cryptocurrencies/alternative investments and interest rate products, including Eurodollar futures and options, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) futures and options, Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield (BSBY), livestock and cash-settled contracts based on the S&P 500, including the E-mini S&P 500 ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) contract, Micro E-mini Equity Index contracts, Nasdaq-100, FTSE Russell and Bitcoin and Ether Reference Rate. \u2022CBOT's product slate consists of agricultural, equities and interest rate products, including contracts for United States (U.S.) Treasury futures, soybean, corn, and wheat and contracts based on the Dow Jones Industrial Index. \u2022NYMEX's product slate consists of energy and metals products, including contracts for crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, gasoline and emissions (GEO and NGO). \u2022COMEX's product slate consists of metals products, including contracts for gold, silver, copper and other base metals. We believe the breadth and diversity of our products and services lines are beneficial to our customers and CME Group's overall performance. Our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs, and customers are able to manage risks and achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house. CME Group products are traded primarily through CME Globex, as well as by open outcry in Chicago for Eurodollar options and SOFR options and through privately negotiated transactions.  We strive to provide the most flexible and scalable platforms to support the operational and capacity needs of our business along with the delivery of innovative technology solutions to the marketplace. Our CME Globex electronic platform is the trading engine for our central limit order book markets and is available on a global basis nearly 24 hours a day throughout the trading week. The CME Globex platform is accessible through a wide variety of vendor-provided and custom-built trading systems that benefit from our open application programming interface approach. For electronic and privately negotiated markets, we offer brokers and customers the CME Direct platform for arranging, executing, recording and risk-managing trades across all six major asset classes. We also provide the functionality to connect to CME Direct on a mobile device through our CME Direct Mobile application with full trading and on-the-go order management capabilities.  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Together, our platforms offer: \u2022certainty of execution;   \u2022extensive capabilities to facilitate complex and demanding trading;   \u2022direct market access;   \u2022fairness, price transparency and anonymity;  \u2022convenience and efficiency;  \u2022connectivity through highly secure, resilient and low-latency network options;  \u2022access to market data; and \u2022global distribution, including connectivity through high-speed international telecommunications hubs in key financial centers or order routing to our global partner exchanges. We maintain comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans and facilities designed to provide nearly continuous availability of our markets in the event of a business disruption or disaster. We also maintain incident and crisis management plans that address responses to disruptive events. The customer base of our derivatives exchanges includes professional traders, financial institutions, institutional and individual investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers, governments and central banks. Customers may be members of one or more of our exchanges. Rights to directly access our derivatives markets will depend upon the nature of the customer, such as whether the entity or individual is a member of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access. U.S. trading rights and privileges are exchange-specific. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members. Membership on one of our derivatives exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at lower fees. Under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges, our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections, certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections. In 2022, 83% of our contract volume was from trades by our members. CME Clearing Business: Through our clearing house, CME Clearing, which is operated by CME, we provide clearing and settlement services for a broad range of exchange-traded futures and options on futures contracts and OTC derivatives. Our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and the soundness of our markets by serving as the counterparty to every trade, becoming the buyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer, and limiting counterparty credit risk. CME Clearing marks open positions to market at least twice a trading day, requiring payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and making payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. For select cleared-only markets, positions are marked-to-market daily, with the capacity to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. The CME ClearPort front-end system provides access to our flexible clearing services for block transactions, bi-lateral trades and swaps.  The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represents charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One firm represented at least 10% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2022. In the event a clearing firm were to withdraw, our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to one or more other clearing firms of the exchange. Cash Markets Business: Our cash markets business is comprised of BrokerTec and EBS. Certain BrokerTec and EBS products are cleared at third-party clearing houses. BrokerTec and EBS offer anonymous and disclosed trading venues, offering clients multiple execution and distribution options and the benefit of an established and far-reaching distribution network of liquidity providers and consumers. Our BrokerTec Central Limit Order Books were migrated from a third-party platform to our CME Globex electronic platform in the first quarter of 2021 and our EBS Central Limit Order Books were migrated to the CME Globex platform in the second quarter of 2022.  \u2022BrokerTec operates global electronic trading for fixed income products on the CME Globex platform, with a leading position in cash U.S. Treasuries, E.U. and U.S. repo fixed income instruments and European Government Bonds. It facilitates trading for banks and non-bank professional trading firms. BrokerTec Quote is a third party Request For Quote platform that offers a dealer-to-client trading solution for the European and U.S. government repo markets. BrokerTec Stream is a relationship-based trading platform offering U.S. Treasury instruments.  \u2022EBS provides for the trading of FX products across major and emerging market currencies. EBS also offers execution of non-deliverable forwards through a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) registered swap execution facility (SEF), operated by one of our subsidiaries. EBS operates both as a Central Limit Order Book platform for spot and non-deliverable forwards currency pairs, as well as a relationship-based third-party trading platform offering spot FX, FX forwards and FX swaps.  Market Data Business:  We offer a variety of market data services through industry-leading market data platforms and third-party distribution partners, which are designed to meet the risk-management, trading, investment and business needs of our  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents global client base. As such, we provide proprietary real-time and historical market data related to CME Group\u2019s vibrant and deeply liquid exchanges and cash markets businesses. We further offer derived cash markets pricing, third-party and alternative data sets, as well as a wide range of analytic tools. As customers continue to leverage cloud technology to improve and evolve their businesses, CME Group has taken a leading role by becoming the first derivatives marketplace to provide live market data natively in the cloud with the launch of our cloud connect capabilities on the Google Cloud Platform. CME Group is also the distributor of leading benchmark equity and commodity indices on behalf of third parties as well as our own proprietary benchmarks and indices, including CME Term SOFR Reference Rates (CME Term SOFR), which is a benchmark designed to adhere to the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks.   Our Strategic Initiatives  The following is a description of our strategic initiatives: Maximize Futures and Options Growth Globally - We continue to focus on driving growth and new customer acquisition by expanding, innovating and scaling our core offerings, and increasing participation from non-U.S. customers. We do this by expanding our global sales team, cross-selling our products, expanding the strength of our existing benchmark products, launching new products and services and deepening open interest in our core futures and options offerings.  We have further focused on building upon cloud-based data distribution capabilities as a more flexible and potentially cost-effective means of providing data to our clients. In 2022, CME Group futures and options had an average daily volume of 23.3 million contracts, with a volume record in our equity asset class for the seventh consecutive year. It was also a year of volume records for multiple products, including Ultra 10 Year Treasury Note futures, SOFR futures, Bitcoin futures, Micro E-Mini Equity Index futures and a record number of contracts executed via Basis Trade at Index Close.  We set records in the volume traded for our Micro E-Mini Equity Index futures in total, as well as for each of the Micro E-Mini Nasdaq-100, Russell 2000 and Dow 30 contracts.  We continue to expand and deepen our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world the most broad and diversified portfolio of benchmark products. Some of our products introduced over the past two years include: \u2022E-mini Nasdaq 100 Weekly Options (2021) \u2022E-mini Russell 2000 Weekly Options (2021) \u2022Micro Bitcoin Futures (2021) \u2022Ether and Micro Ether Futures (2021) \u2022Micro Treasury Yield Futures (2021) \u2022Micro WTI Futures (2021) \u2022Global Emissions Offset (GEO) and Nature-based Global Emissions Offset (N-GEO) Futures (2021) \u2022Additional Cryptocurrency Reference Rates and Real-Time Indices (2022) \u2022CBL Core Global Emissions Offset Futures (2022) \u202220-year U.S. Treasury Bond Futures (2022) \u2022Micro Bitcoin and Ether Options (2022) \u2022Aluminum Options (2022) \u2022Canadian Wheat Futures (2022) \u2022Micro WTI Options (2022) \u2022Six new E-mini sector index Futures (2022) \u2022Euro-denominated Bitcoin and Ether Futures (2022) \u2022Ether Options (2022) \u2022Ten event contracts linked to our global benchmarks (2022) \u2022TBA futures for Mortgage-backed Securities (2022) \u2022Euro Short-Term Rate (\u20acSTR) Futures and RepoFunds Rate (RFR) Futures (2022) In addition to the individual product launches noted above, we have completed many product extensions across our asset classes, including short-dated options products (Monday and Wednesday weekly options on Gold, Silver and Copper and Tuesday and Thursday weekly options on the E-Mini S&P 500). We continue to expand and deepen our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world with the most broad and diversified portfolio of benchmark products. We believe we have a significant opportunity to expand the participation of our non-U.S. customer base in our markets. Our penetration of these markets lags our development in the U.S., and we believe that there is room for significant growth and development of these financial markets.  In 2022, approximately 28% of our electronic  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents futures and options volume was from transactions reported as outside the U.S. and approximately 52% of our market data revenue was derived from outside the U.S. We also achieved 27% growth in trading volume during Asian trading hours and 10% growth during European trading hours in 2022 compared to 2021. CME Group continues to introduce tools which assist our clients in managing their risks. In 2021, we updated the FX Market Profile Tool and launched a Metals Market Profile and, in 2022, we launched an UST Market Profile. The FX and Metals Market Profile Tool on Quant Analytics offers a simple but effective method for clients to compare and contrast our leading FX and metals products and liquidity pools side-by-side, which in turn enables clients to analyze their opportunity to minimize costs and achieve best execution by accessing highly complementary liquidity pools across cash and futures markets. We expect to continue to expand this Quant Analytics suite in the future as well.  Our CME Liquidity Tool enables market participants to analyze liquidity across CME Group products during U.S., London or Singapore trading hours and was expanded to 37 products in 2021 to meet customer demand for our growing product suite. CME Group Volatility Indexes (CVOL) comprises a total of 39 indexes, including six unique broad-based benchmarks such as the Treasury Volatility Index and Commodity Volatility Index.  In 2022, we launched real-time streaming versions of the CVOL indexes.  CVOL provide a representative measure of the market expectation of 30-day forward risk, comprising both end of day and live streaming values. We have increased our customer base and continue to target cross-asset sales across client segments and across cash and futures platforms, driving global sales and generating new client participation across all regions. We have a long history of providing customer value and responsiveness and believe our products and services position us to help our customers adapt to and comply with new regulations, while enabling them to efficiently manage their risks. We have a broad distribution network comprised of a combination of internal and external channels and proprietary front-end capabilities. Diversify our Business and Revenue - Our acquisition of NEX in 2018 strengthened our role in global financial markets infrastructure and information services, adding complementary cash and OTC businesses and scale to our listed interest rate and FX products, while broadening our global client base. We are positioned to take direct advantage of growth in treasury issuance, unwinding of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, liquid treasury holdings and the trading of treasury instruments, as well as growing repo activity in the U.S. and Europe. The transaction expanded CME Group\u2019s position in the large, highly competitive and highly fragmented global FX marketplace, offering both order book trading and relationship-based trading solutions for customers. The acquisition added strength in underlying customer marketplaces, especially around regional bank customers and other market participants outside of North America, and expanded our market data solutions beyond futures and options into cash and OTC offerings.   During 2021, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) formally recommended the forward-looking term rates based on SOFR published by our subsidiary, CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited. The ARRC formalized this recommendation in July 2021. Through the end of 2022, we have licensed the CME Term SOFR to over 1,900 firms and over 7,000 users in more than 90 countries. In 2010, CME Group acquired a majority stake in Dow Jones Indexes, which was combined with S&P\u2019s index business in 2012 to form S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, of which CME Group now has a 27% ownership stake. S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC combines the world class capabilities of the S&P and Dow Jones Indices, and is a significant player in passive investing, including the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry value chain. As part of the joint venture, we acquired a long-term, ownership-linked, exclusive license to list futures and options based on the S&P 500 Index and certain other S&P indices. We also act as the joint venture's licensing agent and distribution services provider. In 2022, we invested $410.0 million in this joint venture to fund our portion of the acquisition of the IHS Markit indices business, which includes leading fixed income and credit indices, such as iBoxx, iTraxx and CDX.   In 2021, CME Group and IHS Markit established a 50/50 joint venture, OSTTRA. We contributed to OSTTRA our post-trade businesses (Traiana, TriOptima and Reset) and IHS Markit contributed its MarkitSERV business. OSTTRA serves as the leading optimization business and provider of progressive post-trade solutions for the global OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity and credit asset classes. In February 2022, IHS Markit was acquired by S&P Global. Deliver Unparalleled Customer Efficiencies and Operational Excellence - With changing regulatory requirements for many of our customers, including additional margin requirements on uncleared trades, and the need for greater efficiencies, we have added tools to enable customers to manage clearing positions in our markets in an efficient manner. With the ongoing implementation of regulatory reform in the United States and in Europe, along with global implementation of Basel III capital requirements on financial institutions, we expect centralized clearing and capital efficiencies to continue to be important for our global client base. We provide a comprehensive multi-asset class clearing solution to market participants for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing house. Our clearing services offer the ability to optimize collateral and capital efficiencies across portfolios within the clearing house while meeting the heightened regulatory requirements on derivatives. The majority of our clearing volumes and activities are related to our listed futures and options, which represents  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents the majority of our open interest and collateral held against these positions. We also offer clearing services for OTC interest rate swaps, FX forwards and commodity swaps.  CME Group provides various tools and services to assist customers with capital and operational efficiencies, including: \u2022CME Clearing provides compression via coupon blending as well as CME CORE, an interactive margin calculator that enables clients to optimize their capital by providing insights on margin requirements prior to trading.  \u2022Portfolio margining allows firms to capitalize on margin offsets between futures, options and cleared OTC instruments with common risk factors.  \u2022Cross-margining allows firms to achieve portfolio margin efficiencies for offsetting positions between two clearing houses, including CME and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) or CME and Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), through reduced performance bond requirements. Partnership with Google Cloud - In November 2021, we announced a 10-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud to accelerate CME Group\u2019s move to the cloud, which we expect will transform derivatives markets by expanding access and creating efficiencies for market participants. The partnership will focus on expanding access to CME Group\u2019s infrastructure, advancing real-time data and analytics capabilities, co-innovating new products and services, increasing efficiencies and driving resiliency in the financial markets\u2019 ecosystem. 2022 was a foundational year, where we built the Cloud platform and successfully migrated some applications.  In 2023, we plan to accelerate our application migration, including launching and commercializing data products in the Cloud.   Patents, Trademarks and Licenses We own the rights to a large number of trademarks, service marks, domain names and trade names in the U.S., Europe and other parts of the world. We have registered many of our most important trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. We hold the rights to a number of patents and have a number of patent applications pending. Our patents cover match engine, trader user interface, trading floor support, market data, general technology and clearing house functionalities. We also own copyrights to a variety of materials. Those copyrights, some of which are registered, include printed and online publications, websites, advertisements, educational materials, graphic presentations and other literature, both textual and electronic. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks, patents, copyrights, database rights, trade secrets, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. We offer equity index futures and options on key benchmarks, including S&P, Nasdaq, Dow Jones, FTSE Russell and fixed income index futures on the BSBY indexes. These products are listed by us subject to license agreements with the applicable owners of the indexes, some of which are exclusive. In connection with S&P Dow Jones Indices, we have a license agreement (S&P License Agreement) for certain S&P stock indexes and related trade names, trademarks and service marks in connection with the creation, marketing, trading, clearing and promoting of futures contracts and/or options on futures contracts that are indexed to certain S&P stock indexes. Our license for the S&P 500 Index will be exclusive for futures and options until one year prior to the termination of the S&P License Agreement, and non-exclusive for the last year. The license for the other S&P stock indexes is generally exclusive for futures and options. The term of the S&P License Agreement will continue until the date that is one year after the date that CME Group ceases to own at least 5% (accounting for dilution) of the outstanding interests in S&P Dow Jones Indices. Upon the occurrence of certain events, including certain terminations of the joint venture, the term may be extended up to an additional ten years. In connection with S&P Dow Jones Indices, we also have an exclusive license agreement (Dow Jones License Agreement) for certain Dow Jones indexes. The initial term of the agreement is through June 30, 2026. Following the initial term, the Dow Jones License Agreement will automatically renew for renewal terms of five years thereafter, so long as there is open interest in any of CBOT\u2019s or its affiliates\u2019 products based on one or more of the Dow Jones licensed indexes. In the event there is no open interest in any such products, then we may terminate the agreement. We also have an exclusive license agreement for certain Nasdaq indexes through 2029. In 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with FTSE Russell and launched the E-mini Russell 2000 futures in 2017. We pay the applicable third-party, per-trade fees based on contract volume under the terms of these licensing agreements. A copy of the S&P License Agreement has been filed as a material contract.  CME Group is the owner of CME Term SOFR, a daily set of forward-looking interest rate estimates, calculated and published for 1-month, 3-month and 12-month tenors. CME Term SOFR was endorsed by the ARRC convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve and the Board itself under its Final Rule published in January 2023, which Rule has generally designated CME Term SOFR as a replacement rate for USD LIBOR under the LIBOR Act.  We cannot guarantee we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with S&P, Dow Jones, Nasdaq and FTSE Russell or be able to maintain existing exclusive and non-exclusive licensing arrangements beyond the term of the current agreements or that any renewal will be on terms as favorable to us. In addition, we cannot guarantee that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we own or have obtained by license, or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments, including securities and options based on the S&P, Dow Jones,  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Nasdaq or FTSE Russell indexes, to manage or speculate on U.S. stock risks. Parties also may succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license, or in countries that are beyond our and/or our licensors' jurisdictional reach.  Competition  The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has seen multiple new entrants over time, and we expect competition to continue to intensify and become more global, especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), EMIR 2.2, Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), Capital Requirements Directive IV, Market Abuse Regulation, Benchmarks Regulation, Basel III and various other laws and regulations. Please also refer to the discussion below and in \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" beginning on page 15 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties. Competition in our Derivatives Exchange Business We believe competition in the derivatives business is based on a number of factors, including, among others: \u2022brand and reputation; \u2022efficient and secure settlement, clearing and support services; \u2022depth and liquidity of markets; \u2022capital efficiencies; \u2022diversity of product offerings and frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services;   \u2022ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs;   \u2022efficient and seamless customer experience; \u2022transparency, reliability, anonymity and security in transaction processing;   \u2022regulatory environment; \u2022connectivity, accessibility, flexibility in execution methods, and distribution;   \u2022technological capability and innovation; and \u2022overall transaction costs.  We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. Our deep, liquid markets; diverse and complementary product offerings; frequency and quality of new product development; and efficient, secure settlement, clearing and support services, distinguish us from others in the industry. We believe that in order to maintain our competitive position, we must continue to expand globally; develop and offer new and innovative products; enhance our technology infrastructure, including its reliability, functionality and security; maintain liquidity and low transaction costs; continue to strengthen our risk management capabilities and solutions; and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers. We compete in a large and expanding financial services trading, clearing and settlement marketplace globally. Our competitors include, among other entities, exchanges such as Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE), the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited and Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG. We have also seen the emergence of new players in the derivatives exchange business, in some cases backed by market makers and broker-dealers, as well as crypto platforms. Competition also includes alternative means of developing exposures through alternative instruments (depending on market factors) such as cash, OTC, ETFs, options, warrants, contracts for differences, structured products and other offerings and incorporates large customer and channel internalization of trade flows and data. New emerging competitors have targeted different segments of our industry, with multiple execution models and products, and emerging technologies will continue to offer additional alternative products in the future. Competition in our industry continues to be dynamic, and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of well-capitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business. Competition in our CME Clearing Business In recent years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services, and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with compliance with Dodd-Frank, EMIR 2.2, Basel III, MiFID II and other various laws and regulations. Our competitors in the clearing services space include, among others, companies such as ICE, LCH Group, the OCC, CBOE Clear, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, LME Clearing and Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG. In light of the implementation of new regulatory requirements and other financial  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents services reforms, we believe other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing and other related post-trade services in the U.S. as CFTC-regulated clearing organizations.  We believe competition in clearing services is based on, among other things, the value of providing customers with capital and margin efficiencies; quality and reliability of the services; creditworthiness of the clearing house; regulatory costs; timely delivery of the services; reputation; diversity of the service offerings; confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures; and the fees charged for the services provided. Competition in our Cash Markets Business The cash markets businesses face substantial competition across a wide and growing array of venues. In FX, the marketplace is highly fragmented, and there is competition from other electronic communication networks, single-dealer platforms, bank-owned multi-participant platforms, streaming and request for quote services, trading venues tied to data platforms, voice brokers, other broker enabled platforms and other venues. There is a growing array of platforms and technologies, often owned by well-capitalized financial institutions and intermediaries that are also driving internalization of client FX trade flows. In the fixed income space, there are also multiple providers of treasury, European and U.S. repo, and European bond trading, as well as other products such as corporate bonds, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed bonds and agencies, and a multitude of competitors and new entrants offering single-dealer liquidity, bank-owned multi-participant platforms, streaming and request for quote services, and other broker and exchange-enabled platforms. Competition in our Market Data Business Technology companies, market data and information vendors and front-end software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data calculation and distribution capabilities that could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange. Multiple other industry participants offer both referential and indicative pricing alternatives to CME offerings, which are widely distributed and available across a variety of media. Distributors and consumers of our market data also may use our market data as an input into products that compete against our traded or cleared products. Although we may receive license fees for such products, such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable product.  Regulatory Matters  Our businesses are regulated and serve a customer base that includes regulated market participants, and as such, we are subject to extensive regulation, primarily in the United States and Europe. Developments in the regulatory environment therefore have the potential to significantly affect our businesses. Please also refer to the discussion below and in \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" beginning on page 15 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties. Regulation of our Derivatives Business, CME Clearing and our SEF Our operation of U.S. futures exchanges, CME Clearing and our SEF is subject to extensive regulation by the CFTC that requires our regulated subsidiaries to satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house. The CFTC carries out the regulation of the futures and swaps markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act as amended by, among others, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act and Dodd-Frank. Regulations implementing Dodd-Frank include rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain OTC derivatives, swap reporting, operation of a clearing house, anti-manipulation, large trader reporting, product definitions, the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets, swap execution facilities and swap data repositories.  CME has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization. These designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our risk-management standards and clearing and settlement activities by the CFTC and the Federal Reserve Board. In connection with the global offering of our products and clearing services, this business is also subject to the rules and regulations of the local jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Bank of England, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) in Germany, among others. Regulation of our Cash Markets Business The operation of BrokerTec subjects us to regulation by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a broker-dealer and alternative trading system operator. It also subjects us to regulation by authorities in the E.U. as a multilateral trading facility and regulated market and by the applicable regulators in  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents Singapore and Canada. Our EBS business holds various permissions, approvals and exemptions globally, including those that subject certain of its activities to CFTC, FCA, AFM, Monetary Authority of Singapore, Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Hong Kong Monetary Authority oversight. The settlement of matched principal and exchange-traded businesses requires access to clearing houses either directly or through third-party providers of clearing and settlement services. BrokerTec Americas is a member of the Fixed Inocme Clearing Corporation, through which it clears U.S. Treasury and repo products. Regulation of our Market Data Business Our subsidiary, CME Group Benchmark Administration, is a registered benchmark administrator, authorized and supervised by the FCA under the UK Benchmark Regulations. CME Group Benchmark offers a variety of different multi-asset class data products, including CME Term SOFR.  Key Areas of Focus We actively monitor and participate in the domestic and international legislative and rulemaking processes for our industry, including providing government testimony, commenting on proposed legislation and rulemaking, and educating our regulators and policymakers on potential impacts to the marketplace. We are also focused on the U.S. Presidential administration and its federal regulatory appointees and any anticipated changes that may result.   Our key areas of focus in the regulatory environment are: \u2022The implementation of a transaction tax or user fee in the U.S., U.K. or E.U., or in the States of Illinois or New Jersey, which could discourage institutions and individuals from using our markets or products or encourage them to trade in another less costly jurisdiction. Legislation to impose a financial transaction tax has been proposed previously in the U.S. Congress, Illinois General Assembly and State of New Jersey Legislature. Additionally, from time to time, including this fiscal year, the proposed U.S. Presidential budget request has included a proposal to impose a user fee to fund all or a portion of the budget of the CFTC. Legislation would be necessary to impose such a fee. Federal legislation was also recently proposed by Congress that would impose a user fee on digital asset spot markets to fund CFTC regulation of those assets. Such a user fee, if adopted, could potentially be expanded to apply more broadly to the futures and options markets.  \u2022Legislation that proposes to eliminate the 60/40 tax treatment of certain of our futures and options contracts, which would result in 60% of the gains being taxed at the short-term capital gain rate instead of the long-term capital gain rate. This would impose a significant increase in tax rates applicable to certain market participants and could result in a decrease in their trading activity.   \u2022Certain provisions in relation to the E.U. Regulations on Benchmarks have yet to come into effect, and prices and data provided by CME Group for use by E.U. supervised entities and use of those benchmarks may be impacted.  \u2022Concerns that European legislators will prohibit or restrict exclusive licenses for benchmark indexes, which might impact the profitability of several of our most popular contracts.  \u2022The implementation of rules resulting in negative treatment of the liquidity profile of U.S. Treasury securities, including as qualifying liquidity resources, or any potential limitation on the use of U.S. Treasury securities as collateral could result in increased costs to us and our clearing firms. \u2022The outcome of the debate regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies, which may impact our existing offerings or our ability to provide future offerings. \u2022New regulations governing treasury market structure, including potential clearing obligations or promotions of all-to-all cash treasury models.  The SEC has issued a rule proposal regarding central clearing of U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements; how the SEC finalizes this rule could have an impact on trading in our markets. \u2022The potential for regulatory or policy actions that could result in changes to market structure for the clearing of derivative transactions, which may impact our business model or the competitive landscape of the industry.   Please also see \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" beginning on page 15 for additional information on our areas of regulatory risks.
