WP owns property and does business as an electric public utility in Pennsylvania. WP provides transmission and distribution services in southwestern, south-central, and northern Pennsylvania. The area it serves has a population of approximately 1.6\u00a0million.  FirstEnergy is proceeding with the consolidation of the Pennsylvania Companies into a new, single operating entity. The PA Consolidation will require, among other steps: (a) the transfer of certain Pennsylvania-based transmission assets owned by WP to KATCo, (b) the transfer of Class B equity interests of MAIT currently held by PN and ME to FE (and ultimately transferred to FET as part of the FET Minority Equity Interest Sale), (c) the formation of PA NewCo and (d) the merger of each of the Pennsylvania Companies with and into PA NewCo, with PA NewCo surviving such mergers as the successor-in-interest to all assets and liabilities of the Pennsylvania Companies. Following completion of the PA Consolidation, PA NewCo will be FE\u2019s only regulated utility in Pennsylvania encompassing the operations previously conducted individually by the Pennsylvania Companies. Consummation of the PA Consolidation is contingent upon numerous conditions, including the approval of NYPSC, PPUC and FERC. Subject to receipt of such regulatory approvals, FirstEnergy expects that the PA Consolidation will close by early 2024.  1 1 1   Regulated Transmission Operating Subsidiaries  FET, the parent of ATSI, MAIT, PATH, and TrAIL, is a subsidiary of FE which holds 80.1% of its issued and outstanding membership interests. Brookfield owns the remaining 19.9% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of FET. Through its subsidiaries, FET owns and operates high-voltage transmission facilities in the PJM Region. FET's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC and applicable state regulatory authorities.  On February 2, 2023, FE, along with FET, entered into the FET P&SA II with Brookfield and the Brookfield Guarantors, pursuant to which FE agreed to sell to Brookfield at the closing, and Brookfield agreed to purchase from FE, an incremental 30% equity interest in FET for a purchase price of $3.5 billion. The purchase price will be payable in part by the issuance of a promissory note expected to be in the principal amount of $1.75 billion. The remaining $1.75 billion of the purchase price will be payable in cash at the closing. As a result of the consummation of the transaction, Brookfield\u2019s interest in FET will increase from 19.9% to 49.9%, while FE will retain the remaining 50.1% ownership interests of FET. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval from the FERC and certain state utility commissions, and completion of review by the CFIUS. In addition, pursuant to the FET P&SA II, FirstEnergy has agreed to make the necessary filings with the applicable regulatory authorities for the PA Consolidation. The FET Minority Equity Interest Sale is expected to close by early 2024. Upon closing, FET will continue to be consolidated in FirstEnergy\u2019s GAAP financial statements.  ATSI owns high-voltage transmission facilities in PJM, which consist of approximately 7,900 circuit miles of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 345 kV, 138 kV and 69 kV in Ohio and Pennsylvania.  TrAIL owns high-voltage transmission facilities in PJM, which consists of approximately 260 circuit miles of transmission lines, including a 500\u00a0kV transmission line extending approximately 150 miles from southwestern Pennsylvania through West Virginia to a point of interconnection with VEPCO in northern Virginia.   MAIT owns high-voltage transmission facilities in PJM, which consist of approximately 4,300 circuit miles of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 500 kV, 345 kV, 230 kV, 138 kV, 115 kV, 69 kV and 46 kV in Pennsylvania.  KATCo was formed to accommodate new transmission construction in the WP, MP and PE footprint and currently does not own or operate any transmission assets.  Service Company  FESC provides legal, financial, and other corporate support services at cost, in accordance with its cost allocation manual, to affiliated FirstEnergy companies.  Operating Segments  FirstEnergy's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Regulated Distribution and Regulated Transmission segments.  The Regulated Distribution segment distributes electricity through FirstEnergy\u2019s ten utility operating companies, serving approximately six million customers within 65,000 square miles of Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, and purchases power for its POLR, SOS, SSO and default service requirements in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland. This segment also controls 3,580 MWs of regulated electric generation capacity located primarily in West Virginia and Virginia. The segment's results reflect the costs of securing and delivering electric generation from transmission facilities to customers, including the deferral and amortization of certain related costs.  The Regulated Transmission segment provides transmission infrastructure owned and operated by the Transmission Companies and certain of FirstEnergy's utilities (JCP&L, MP, PE and WP) to transmit electricity from generation sources to distribution facilities. The segment's revenues are primarily derived from forward-looking formula rates. Under forward-looking formula rates, the revenue requirement is updated annually based on a projected rate base and projected costs, which is subject to an annual true-up based on actual rate base and costs. The segment's results also reflect the net transmission expenses related to the delivery of electricity on FirstEnergy's transmission facilities. On November 6, 2021, FirstEnergy, along with FET, entered into the FET P&SA I, with Brookfield and the Brookfield Guarantors pursuant to which FET agreed to issue and sell to Brookfield at the closing, and Brookfield agreed to purchase from FET, certain newly issued membership interests of FET, such that Brookfield would own 19.9% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of FET, for a purchase price of $2.375 billion. The transaction closed on May 31, 2022. On February 2, 2023, FE, along with FET, entered into the FET P&SA II with Brookfield and the Brookfield Guarantors, pursuant to which FE agreed to sell to Brookfield at the closing, and Brookfield agreed to purchase from FE, an incremental 30% equity interest in FET for a purchase price of $3.5 billion. The purchase price will be payable in part by the issuance of a promissory note expected to be in the principal amount of $1.75 billion. The remaining $1.75 billion of the purchase price will be payable in cash at the closing. As a result of the consummation of the transaction, Brookfield\u2019s interest in FET will increase from 19.9% to 49.9%, while FE will retain the remaining 50.1% ownership interests of FET. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval from the FERC and certain state utility commissions, and completion of review by the CFIUS. In addition, pursuant to the FET P&SA II, FirstEnergy has agreed to make  2 2 2   the necessary filings with the applicable regulatory authorities for the PA Consolidation. The FET Minority Equity Interest Sale is expected to close by early 2024. Upon closing, FET will continue to be consolidated in FirstEnergy\u2019s GAAP financial statements.  Corporate/Other reflects corporate support and other costs not charged or attributable to the Utilities or Transmission Companies, including FE's retained Pension and OPEB assets and liabilities of the FES Debtors, interest expense on FE\u2019s holding company debt and other investments or businesses that do not constitute an operating segment. Additionally, reconciling adjustments for the elimination of inter-segment transactions are included in Corporate/Other. As of December\u00a031, 2022, 67\u00a0MWs of electric generating capacity, representing AE Supply's OVEC capacity entitlement, was also included in Corporate/Other for segment reporting. As of December\u00a031, 2022, Corporate/Other had approximately $5.4 billion of FE holding company debt.   Utility Regulation Regulatory Accounting   FirstEnergy accounts for the effects of regulation through the application of regulatory accounting to the Utilities and the Transmission Companies since their rates are established by a third-party regulator with the authority to set rates that bind customers, are cost-based and can be charged to and collected from customers.  The Utilities and the Transmission Companies recognize, as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, costs which FERC and the various state utility commissions, as applicable, have authorized for recovery from or return to customers in future periods or for which authorization is probable. Without the probability of such authorization, costs currently recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would have been charged or credited to income as incurred. All regulatory assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered from or returned to customers. Based on current ratemaking procedures, the Utilities and the Transmission Companies continue to collect cost-based rates for their transmission and distribution services; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Utilities and the Transmission Companies continue the application of regulatory accounting to those operations. Regulatory accounting is applied only to the parts of the business that meet the above criteria. If a portion of the business applying regulatory accounting no longer meets those requirements, previously recorded regulatory assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet in accordance with GAAP. State Regulation The following table summarizes the allowed ROE and the aggregate actual ROE of the Regulated Distribution Utilities by state for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, as determined for regulatory purposes: StateAllowed ROEActual ROE(1)Maryland9.65%8.8%New Jersey9.6%7.0%Ohio10.5%8.4%PennsylvaniaSettled(2)8.1%West VirginiaSettled(2)6.6% Actual ROE(1) New Jersey Settled(2) Settled(2) (1) Actual ROE is based on methodology used in last distribution rate case and/or quarterly earnings reports, as applicable. Rate base is for distribution assets only (except West Virginia, which includes generation and transmission assets) and reflects the actual capital structure for Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Maryland, and the allowed capital structure for Ohio. Actual ROEs reflect actual revenue (not weather normalized) and historical results should not be relied upon to estimate the outcome of future rate cases as regulatory assumptions may vary. ROEs may not tie to upcoming rate filings due to items such as updated allocators, taxes, and adjustments.  (2) Commission-approved settlement agreements did not disclose ROE rates.

Federal Regulation See \"Outlook - FERC Regulatory Matters\" in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information and discussion. Environmental Matters See \"Outlook - Environmental Matters\" in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information and discussion. 3 3 3    Capital Requirements  FirstEnergy\u2019s business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction and other investment expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and interest payments, dividend payments and potential contributions to its pension plan. See \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information and discussion.   Supply Plan  Supply Chain  FirstEnergy has continued to experience supply chain challenges due to economic conditions following the global pandemic. Lead times continue to increase across numerous material categories, with some as much as doubling from pre-pandemic lead times. Suppliers continue to struggle with labor shortages and raw material availability, which, along with inflationary pressure, have increased the costs and decreased the availability of certain materials, equipment and contractors. FirstEnergy continues to monitor supply chain risk as it anticipates these challenges continuing into 2023 and is mitigating these risks by:  \u2022Utilizing a cross-functional team to forecast potential impacts to operations and programs; \u2022Expanding supply base to increase resiliency; \u2022Enhancing the demand management and material reservation process; \u2022Evaluating substitute products, reserving production capacity, and buying ahead in targeted categories; and \u2022Staying updated by participating in discussions with other utilities through EEI, which has a long history of mutual assistance in the electric utility industry.  Default Service  Certain of the Utilities have default service obligations to provide power to non-shopping customers who have elected to continue to receive service under regulated retail tariffs. The volume of these sales can vary depending on the level of shopping that occurs and these default service plans vary by state and by service territory. JCP&L\u2019s default service, or BGS supply, is secured through a statewide competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. Default service for the Ohio Companies, Pennsylvania Companies and PE's Maryland jurisdiction are provided through a competitive procurement process approved by the PUCO (under ESP IV), PPUC (under the DSP) and MDPSC (under the SOS), respectively. If any supplier fails to deliver power to any one of those Utilities\u2019 service areas, the Utility serving that area may need to procure the required power in the market in their role as the default Load Serving Entity. West Virginia electric generation continues to be regulated by the WVPSC.  Fuel Supply  MP currently has coal contracts with various terms to purchase approximately 7.4\u00a0million tons of coal for the year 2023, which, along with its 2022 year-end inventory levels, accounts for nearly all of its forecasted 2023 coal requirements. MP has the ability to acquire additional tonnage through options available in its current contracts, as well as purchases through the spot market. The contracts expire at various times through 2026. This contracted coal is produced primarily from mines located in Pennsylvania, Illinois and West Virginia. In order to meet emission requirements, MP holds contracts for a variety of reagents expiring at various times through 2026, as well as the ability to purchase additional reagents through the spot market. Additionally, MP is granted emission allowances by the EPA and purchases additional allowances as needed to meet emission requirements. See \"Outlook - Environmental Matters\" in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information pertaining to the impact of increased environmental regulations on fuel supply.  4 4 4    System Demand The maximum hourly demand for each of the Utilities was: System Demand202220212020(in MWs)CEI4,266\u00a04,253\u00a04,188\u00a0JCP&L6,122\u00a05,902\u00a06,056\u00a0ME3,021\u00a02,976\u00a02,974\u00a0MP2,124\u00a02,114\u00a02,121\u00a0OE5,652\u00a05,598\u00a05,494\u00a0PE3,514\u00a02,905\u00a03,609\u00a0Penn944\u00a0889\u00a0946\u00a0PN2,838\u00a02,908\u00a03,020\u00a0TE2,277\u00a02,265\u00a02,787\u00a0WP3,827\u00a03,827\u00a04,012\u00a0   Regional Reliability  All of FirstEnergy's facilities are located within PJM and operate under the reliability oversight of a regional entity known as RFC. This regional entity operates under the oversight of NERC in accordance with a delegation agreement approved by FERC.   Competition  Within FirstEnergy\u2019s Regulated Distribution segment, generally there is no competition for electric distribution service in the Utilities\u2019 respective service territories in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Additionally, there has traditionally been no competition for transmission service in PJM. However, pursuant to FERC\u2019s Order No. 1000 and subject to state and local siting and permitting approvals, non-incumbent developers now can compete for certain PJM transmission projects in the service territories of FirstEnergy\u2019s Regulated Transmission segment. This could result in additional competition to build transmission facilities in the Regulated Transmission segment\u2019s service territories while also allowing the Regulated Transmission segment the opportunity to seek to build facilities in non-incumbent service territories.   Seasonality  The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business, and weather patterns can have a material impact on FirstEnergy\u2019s Regulated Distribution segment operating results. Demand for electricity in our service territories historically peaks during the summer and winter months. Accordingly, FirstEnergy\u2019s annual results of operations and liquidity position may depend disproportionately on its operating performance during the summer and winter. Mild weather conditions may result in lower power sales and consequently lower revenue and earnings.  5 5 5    Human Capital  FirstEnergy focuses on a number of human capital resources, measures and objectives in managing its business, including: integrity, safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, workplace flexibility, employee development and compensation and benefits. During 2022, the company continued to enhance its dedicated focus on employees by providing employees with additional opportunities to improve belonging, inclusion and engagement within our workforce. Collectively, these focus areas may be material to understanding its business under certain circumstances.   Employees and Collective Bargaining Agreements   As of December\u00a031, 2022, FirstEnergy had 12,335 employees, all of whom were located in the United States as follows: TotalEmployeesBargainingUnitEmployeesFESC5,099\u00a0554\u00a0CEI824\u00a0565\u00a0JCP&L1,361\u00a01,052\u00a0ME579\u00a0452\u00a0MP1,080\u00a0750\u00a0OE1,069\u00a0735\u00a0PE501\u00a0330\u00a0Penn173\u00a0131\u00a0PN694\u00a0487\u00a0TE331\u00a0253\u00a0WP624\u00a0465\u00a0Total12,335\u00a05,774\u00a0  As of December\u00a031, 2022, the IBEW, the UWUA and the OPEIU unions collectively represented approximately half of FirstEnergy\u2019s employees.\u00a0There are 15 collective bargaining agreements between FirstEnergy\u2019s subsidiaries and its unions, which have three, four or five- year terms.\u00a0In 2022, FirstEnergy\u2019s subsidiaries reached new agreements with 3 IBEW locals, covering 620 employees, and 3 UWUA locals, covering 945 employees.

Workplace Flexibility  FirstEnergy is committed to supporting employees\u2019 work/life balance by providing flexible work arrangements for many of its employees, and encouraging career growth as well as personal balance. In Fall 2022, FirstEnergy formally adopted guidelines to facilitate flexible work arrangements for eligible full-time and part-time non-bargaining employees. Flexible work arrangements, like permitting certain employees to work from alternate locations or to begin and end work at variable times, offer a variety of approaches to the way employees work. These approaches can help employees achieve their priorities and meet customer and business needs while promoting enhanced convenience and balance between work and personal commitments.  Employee Development  FirstEnergy\u2019s employees are empowered to take ownership of their careers with increased openness into FirstEnergy\u2019s internal and external hiring process and greater availability of tools and processes that support career management, talent reviews, succession planning and leadership selection. FirstEnergy is committed to preparing its high-performing workforce for the future and helping employees reach their full potential. That means developing employee skills and competencies and preparing emerging and experienced leaders for future management responsibilities.  Understanding FirstEnergy\u2019s rapidly changing industry and strategy is key to employees\u2019 ability to support FirstEnergy\u2019s mission and meet its customers\u2019 evolving needs.
