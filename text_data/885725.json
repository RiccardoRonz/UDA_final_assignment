Markets  Competition  We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products and solutions, some from companies that may have greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic plc, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. In certain countries, and particularly in China, we also face competition from domestic medical device companies that may benefit from their status as local suppliers. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products, or from companies offering technologies that could augment or replace procedures using our products.   We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both differentiated clinical and economic outcomes for our customers by enabling physicians to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively often in a less-invasive and cost effective manner. We also compete on ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, with economically motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increasing prevalence and importance of regional and national tenders, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to:   \u2022offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes, \u2022create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies, \u2022apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets, \u2022develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions, \u2022attract and retain qualified personnel,  \u2022obtain patent or other protection for our products, \u2022obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals, \u2022continually provide quality products and enhance our quality systems,  \u2022supply sufficient inventory at competitive prices to meet customer demand.  7 7 7   Research and Development   Our investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. Our investment in research and development supports the following:  \u2022internal research and development programs, regulatory design and clinical science, as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances, and \u2022engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and next-generation products.  We have directed our development efforts toward innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets. We continue to transform how we conduct research and development by identifying best practices, driving efficiencies and optimizing our cost structure, which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept-to-market timelines. Focused, cross-functional teams take a formal approach to new product design and development, helping us to manufacture and offer innovative products consistently and efficiently. Involving cross-functional teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle. We believe this collaboration allows our teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and to maximize cost and time savings as we bring them to market.  In addition to internal development, we work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. We continue to expand our collaborations to include research and development teams in our emerging market countries; these teams will focus on both global and local market requirements at a lower cost of development. We believe that these efforts will play a significant role in our future success.  Marketing and Sales  In 2022, we marketed our products and solutions to approximately 36,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical offices in 130 countries worldwide. Large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions, as well as on key hospital service line administrators.   The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third party distributors in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence.   Resources  Manufacturing and Raw Materials  We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization worldwide. In doing so, we seek to focus our internal resources on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products. We also drive continuous improvement in product quality through process controls and validations, supplier and distribution controls and training and tools for our operations team. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to enhance our operational effectiveness by identifying cost-improvement opportunities.   We remain committed to maintaining appropriate investments to ensure supply chain stability. We have an ongoing supplier resiliency program which identifies and mitigates risk and have taken measures to mitigate the impact of challenges within the global supply chain, including those caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing, sterilization and distribution capabilities and partnerships and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions. Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications.   On an on-going basis, we track supplier status and inventory in risk areas and take action to prevent shortages, monitoring safety stock levels and building up product supplies as warranted, and mitigating risk of technology and material shortages by identifying new vendors. 8 8 8    We have experienced increased levels of unpredictability in the supply of certain raw materials and components used in the manufacturing of our products. While we continue to believe we will have access to the raw materials and components that we need, these supply chain dynamics could result in increased costs to us or an inability to fully meet customer demand for certain of our products.   Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation  We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and other countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. We hold patents worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.  We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties.   We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See Note I \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our 2022 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of intellectual property, product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved.   Regulatory Environment  Medical Device Regulatory Approvals  The medical devices that we manufacture, market and commercialize are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the U.S. FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution. Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device.   In the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of two ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device (the \u201cpredicate\u201d device). Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)\u00a0regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.  The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class\u00a0III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA may seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.  9 9 9   In the European Union (EU), we are required to comply with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR or EU MDR) which became effective May 2021, superseding the existing Medical Device and Active Implantable Medical Device Directives. Medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the prior Directives (issued before May 2021) can continue to be sold during the applicable transition period or until the CE Certificate expires, whichever comes first, providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use. The CE Mark, which is required to sell medical devices in the EU is affixed following a Conformity Assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification by the manufacturer. The selected pathway to CE marking is based on device risk classification. CE marking indicates conformity to the applicable General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) for the MDR. The MDR changes multiple aspects of the regulatory framework for CE marking, such as increased clinical evidence requirements, changes to labelling, and new requirements, including Unique Device Identification (UDI), and many new post-market reporting obligations. MDR also modifies and increases the compliance requirements for the medical device industry and will continue to require significant investment over the next few years to transition all products. The CE mark continues to be a prerequisite for successful registration in many other global geographies. In addition, other EU countries continue to impose significant local registration requirements despite the implementation of MDR, and the United Kingdom has introduced new requirements following its exit from the EU.  We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch or maintain new products on the market, including regulations that have been introduced in many countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia that previously did not have medical device regulations, or had minimal regulations. In Japan we are required to comply with Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) regulations. In conjunction with the MHLW, the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency is an independent agency that is responsible for reviewing drug and medical device applications and works with the MHLW to assess new product safety, develop comprehensive regulations, and monitor post-market safety.  The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record-keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order recall or market withdrawal of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act, pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.  International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported.  Our quality system is designed to enable us to satisfy various international quality system regulations, including those of the U.S. FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our medical device manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO 13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization (ISO) for medical devices, which includes requirements for an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations.   Healthcare Policies and Reimbursement  Political, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. We maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington, D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies that may potentially impact us, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and administration offices, state governors, legislatures and regulatory agencies, embassies and global governments on issues affecting our business. The Government Affairs office also advocates for public policy that benefits our employees and the patients we serve, and supports the communities in which we live.   Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance payers, for the items and services provided to their patients. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the  10 10 10   growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments, price transparency and healthcare delivery and payment structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to place increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, while also being less invasive than alternatives, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers and other stakeholders are significant and new therapies may take significantly longer periods of time to gain widespread adoption.  Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., China, Australia, and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products or procedures using our products, which in turn may make it less likely that a hospital or physician will select our products to treat patients.  Environmental Regulation and Management   We are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We are focused on continuous improvement in environmental metrics with a goal of reducing pollution, minimizing depletion of natural resources and reducing our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. Refer to Corporate Sustainability included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.  Human Capital  At Boston Scientific, our work is guided by core values that define our culture and empower our employees, including Caring, Diversity, Global Collaboration, High Performance, Meaningful Innovation and Winning Spirit. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 45,000 employees, of which approximately 56 percent were outside the U.S. We believe the collective talent of our employees and our shared corporate culture and values give us a competitive advantage. Hiring, developing and retaining talented employees are key parts of our strategy and are critical to our success, particularly in the current environment of labor shortages and unprecedented job market conditions. We strive to do this by fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, providing competitive pay and benefits and flexible work conditions, offering ongoing employee growth and development opportunities and cultivating a culture that prioritizes employee health, safety and well-being.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion   We do our best work to advance health care when we have a diverse range of perspectives and experience on our team. Innovation thrives in a culture of engagement, inclusion and equity. The society in which we live and the customers and patients we serve are diverse and our employees at all levels of the organization must reflect this. In recent years, we have made steady progress to increase the overall representation of employees who identify as women and as African American/Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races (together, multicultural talent). As of December\u00a031, 2022, women represented 30 percent of our Board of Directors, and 49 percent of our employees. In addition, 36 percent of employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico identified as multicultural.   We are committed to our goal of making further progress toward expanding our workforce diversity. In 2020, we set measurable Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) goals with our \u201c3UP by 2023\u201d initiative, which included aspirations of a three percentage point increase in representation of both women and multicultural talent at the supervisor and manager level to 43 percent and 23 percent, respectively, by December\u00a031, 2022. As of December\u00a031, 2022, 42.6 percent of management roles were held by women and, within the U.S and Puerto Rico, 22.6 percent were held by multicultural employees. While we are making progress, our work is far from over. We are committed to intentional action to drive meaningful change. We listen to our employees and use that feedback to complement and expand our existing DE&I programs to emphasize initiatives aimed at developing our pipeline of talent and fostering a psychologically safe and inclusive workplace for all. Additionally, our Executive Committee and our Board of Directors have oversight of employee diversity metrics and hiring trends. As evidence of our commitment to expand DE&I, in 2021, we introduced an ESG scorecard, including DE&I metrics, to our Annual Bonus Plan.   In addition, our ten Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are at the heart of our DE&I strategy. ERGs are voluntary, company-sponsored employee groups that foster and celebrate our diverse work environment. They provide forums for us to learn from  11 11 11   one another, celebrate our uniqueness and develop inclusive leadership skills. We support each ERG by designating global and local executive sponsors and providing financial resources. Our ERG chapters around the world collaborate across the business at all levels and are powerful voices for change in the company.  Additionally, our approach to supplier selection involves building DE&I throughout the Boston Scientific supplier network. We are committed to the increased and sustained support of diverse businesses that share our dedication to improving the quality of patient care. As part of our strategy to combat racism, we have taken steps to further expand the number of Black-owned enterprises that provide supply chain services for our business in the U.S., and are also supporting small and diverse vendors by shortening our standard payment terms.  Compensation and Benefits  We offer competitive, performance-based compensation programs, recognizing that employee well-being, safety, culture, engagement and recognition are all critical to a healthy work environment and productive workforce. We offer programs that acknowledge, respect and support an individual\u2019s life and work choices. Our holistic programs are guided by overall workforce health, focusing on physical, financial and emotional well-being as well as a healthy work environment. We believe that investing in employee well-being leads to improved performance for the individual and the organization.   As part of our broader rewards portfolio, we offer competitive pay and benefits that are flexible and affordable to meet the individual needs of our employees. In addition to cash-based salaries, our rewards portfolio includes cash bonus programs, sales incentives, stock awards, recognition awards, health insurance, paid time off and family leave, retirement savings plans, childcare and Employee Assistance Programs that encourage overall well-being, including help with finances, inclusive family planning and support, elder/child care, legal support and mental health resources.  Equal pay for equal work is rooted in our values and foundational to fostering an inclusive environment. Pay equity is an important part of our long-standing global compensation planning practices. Sustaining pay equity requires constant measurement and attention, so we regularly conduct comprehensive audits, internal and external analyses and company-wide benchmarking of salaries to identify and eliminate disparities. In addition, we periodically contract with an independent, third party to assess pay equity across all positions. Our most recent pay equity study, completed in 2021, reported no statistically significant pay disparity for approximately 99 percent of our employees across gender globally and for multicultural talent in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We continue to educate and train our people, update policies and expand benefits to decrease bias, increase gender and racial representation within our organization, and foster a culture where all employees feel valued and included.  Employee Health and Safety  We take a global approach to prioritizing and monitoring employee health and safety and we strive to foster a safety-oriented culture in all of our offices and facilities. We set health and safety goals which measure the number of injuries per 100 employees for the global organization. Our Employee Health & Safety Global and Regional Councils review performance monthly to discuss trends and risks, as well as opportunities for improvement. We have obtained ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management System at eight of our key global locations. This is a globally recognized standard for employee Occupational Health and Safety, established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to identify key occupational health and safety aspects associated with our business helping to deliver continuous improvement. We have established a company-wide safety goal of 0.25 or fewer injuries per 100 employees by 2030, cutting our year-over-year incident rate by approximately 50 percent from a base year of 2019. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we have achieved a safety level of 0.28 per 100 employees.  Employee Growth and Development  Developing our people professionally is one of the most important things we do. We have robust succession planning to ensure our future leaders are ready to assume roles as they become available. At every level of the company, employees have access to training and tools they can use to advance their skills and expertise and create greater possibilities for their careers. We offer professional and technical courses, including on-the-job training, skills-based learning, mentoring opportunities and leadership development programs for high-potential employees.  Employee Engagement  We seek ongoing feedback from our employees to better understand what we are doing well and, conversely, how we can improve their experience. In addition to encouraging ongoing communication and feedback between employees and their  12 12 12   managers, we conduct periodic employee engagement surveys to ensure all employees have an opportunity to share their insights and we take appropriate action in response. As evidence of our commitment to foster employee engagement, we include these metrics within the ESG scorecard that forms part of our Annual Bonus Plan.  Community Outreach  We are united by a goal to make a difference in the lives of the over 33\u00a0million patients we serve annually. The Boston Scientific Caring value guides us in the work we do each day including how we invest in the well-being of communities. We work to advance possibilities in our three focus areas of health, STEM education and community. Our efforts evolve frequently as do the pressing needs of our communities. In 2022, we focused on supporting Ukrainian refugees, providing aid to those impacted by natural disasters and addressing the basic needs of underserved populations in communities where we live and work. In February 2023, we provided donations to charitable organizations providing earthquake relief efforts in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria, including overnight stays, meals, hygiene items and critical emergency supplies.   Our global community programs empowered employees to participate in and influence the way we care for local communities through volunteerism and personal donations. Many employees chose to support their communities through use of the Employee Matching Gifts program, which was doubled in 2022 on Giving Tuesday, the global day of giving that highlights the importance of supporting local communities around the world during the holiday season. Through employee contributions and the Boston Scientific match, a total of nearly $2\u00a0million was donated in 2022. In February 2023, we launched an additional match campaign through our Employee Matching Gifts Program for aid to T\u00fcrkiye and Syria and are also providing volunteer opportunities for our employees based in T\u00fcrkiye to give back to their local communities.  We have also collaborated with non-profit community organizations to decrease health disparities and reduce the risk for chronic disease for the underserved by increasing access to healthcare and screenings. Within many of the communities in which we operate, we have launched and funded a multi-year program to combat racism, inequity and injustice focused on five pillars: community, economic empowerment, education, healthcare disparities and government policies. We also continue our long-term Close the Gap initiative, which focuses on raising awareness and empowering healthcare providers to reach more patients of color, fight longstanding inequities, and address barriers to care. Through Close the Gap, hospitals and health systems are provided with zip code level data that highlight the disease prevalence and disparities occurring in their communities. The information, along with our health equity resources, allows health care administrators and providers to focus on improving care to underserved populations within their communities.  We are also passionate about inspiring young learners to see themselves in a Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) roles in the future. Employees on our global STEM teams worldwide work with underrepresented K-12 students to share their passion for STEM by providing interactive product demos, development programs, and hands-on activities for young learners in their communities.   Seasonality  Our net sales are influenced by many factors, including product launches, acquisitions, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, patient, physician and employee holiday schedules and other macro-economic conditions. While our consolidated net sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality, customer purchases of our medical devices have historically been lower in the first and third quarters of the year.
