COMPETITION We believe that the principal factors affecting sales of our software include ease of use, breadth and depth of functionality, flexibility, quality, ease of integration with other software systems, file compatibility across computer platforms, range of supported computer platforms, performance, price and total cost of ownership, customer service and support, company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts. Our competitors include large, global, publicly traded companies; small, geographically-focused firms; startup firms; and solutions produced in-house by the end users. Some of our current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us, and some have well-established relationships with current and potential customers of ours. Our current and possible future competitors also include firms that have elected, or may in the future elect, to compete by means of open source licensing. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income. 11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products. We distribute our software products under software license agreements that predominantly grant customers nonexclusive licenses, which are typically nontransferable, for the use of our products. License agreements for our products are generally directly between us and end users. Use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multi-site license for its use of the software product or the software product is by its nature a multi-site-use product. Software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of our software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized use, distribution or reproduction. For most products, customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance, technical support and upgrades, or may lease the product on a fixed-term basis for a fee that includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades. For some products, customers purchase an annual subscription for a certain number of named users that includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades or purchase elastic units, which enable the use of any supported product at any time until their licensed volume is met. We license our software products utilizing a combination of web-based and hard-copy license terms and forms. For certain software products, we primarily rely on \"click-wrapped\" licenses (i.e., online agreements where the website provider posts terms and conditions, and the user clicks on the \"accept\" button). The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain. We also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as registered unpublished copyrighted work. We have obtained federal trademark registration protection for Ansys and other marks in the United States and foreign countries. Additionally, we were awarded numerous patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or equivalent offices in other jurisdictions and have a number of patent applications pending. To the extent we do not choose to seek patent protection for our intellectual property, we primarily rely on the protection of our source code and underlying functionality as a trade secret. Our employees have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information. These agreements, where legally permitted, restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with us anywhere in the world while employed by us (and, in some cases, for specified periods thereafter) and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are our property. In addition, we require all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information.  Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our technology and proprietary information (including source code) will be prevented. Further, there can be no assurance that copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret protection will be available for our products in certain jurisdictions, or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with us will be enforceable. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce our rights to our trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce our patent rights and copyrights, and it is possible that, in the future, our competitors may be able to obtain our trade secrets or to independently develop similar technology. The software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various available legal protections of our technology.  We do not believe that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products. In addition, there are non-practicing entities and patent assertion entities whose business models are built on not producing any products, but rather extracting payments from revenue-generating companies through patent infringement assertions and/or litigation. We expect that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product release delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us. SEASONAL VARIATIONS Our business has experienced seasonality, including quarterly volatility in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months, particularly in Europe, as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of  12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents our global customers. Subscription lease and maintenance contract renewals, as well as our revenue, are typically highest in the fourth quarter. DEFERRED REVENUE AND BACKLOG Deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from customer agreements. The deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable agreements. Our backlog represents deferred revenue associated with installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and committed contracts with start dates beyond the end of the current period.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES At the heart of our culture is a commitment to our people. People are our most important investment and greatest asset. The success and the growth of our business depend on our ability to attract, develop, incent and retain a diverse population of talented, qualified and highly-skilled employees at all levels of our organization, including our executive officers, and across our global workforce. We have developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures that serve as the framework for our human capital management approach. These strategies, objectives and measures are advanced through a number of programs, policies and initiatives, including: promoting diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging; employer branding and talent acquisition; ongoing employee development; competitive compensation, including incentives linked to Ansys' and employees' performance, and competitive benefits programs providing choice and value to our employees; supporting safety and health; and surveying employee satisfaction and engagement. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 5,600 people, including: 2,100 in product development, 2,700 in sales, support and marketing, and 800 in general and administrative functions. Of these employees, 45% were located in the Americas, 28% were located in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and 27% were located in Asia-Pacific (APAC). Certain international employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or have local work councils. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging People are our foundation. Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are the fundamental tenets of our culture and are key to driving better business outcomes, higher team intelligence and greater innovation for our customers.

We have a growing number of employee resource groups dedicated to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging that supports our goals of increasing retention of valuable employees and creating an open culture that fuels innovation. Our employee resource groups include Women in Tech at Ansys, Ansys Pride Alliance, Black Employee Network at Ansys, Veterans at Ansys, Ansys (dis)ability Network, and Ansys Latino Connection. Additionally, we create a culture of inclusion through training on understanding and mitigating bias in people, processes and business decisions.   Employee Recruitment, Development and Retention Our talent strategy is focused on (i) attracting diverse high-quality talent, (ii) continually developing and engaging our employee base and (iii) retaining our people by recognizing and rewarding performance. Our commitment to recruiting diverse talent is evidenced in the United States through our dedication to increasing recruiting efforts at historically black colleges and universities, as well as our involvement with minority engineering societies, women in technology groups, veterans' organizations and LGBTQ+A organizations. In addition to targeted outreach, we recruit talent through (i) attending career and networking events aimed towards recruiting diverse audiences, (ii) hiring internally through our Ansys internship/co-op programs for current students and (iii) value partnerships including professional societies that promote our programs to diverse audiences. We continue to evolve our talent acquisition efforts, as evidenced by our expanded events strategy wherein we doubled the volume of our outreach events in the last year, as well as our priority focus on new external partnerships and recruitment tools that expand our reach to diverse audiences. Additionally, we drive a global focus on hiring emerging talent, placing an emphasis on offering full-time positions through our global internship, co-op and new college graduate programs. Our academic product suite is also widely used in research and teaching settings, which allows students to become familiar with our simulation software and creates opportunities to strengthen our university ties and recruit top talent. The development of our employees is paramount to our success and provided through internal professional development programs and tuition assistance for external programs. We conduct annual individual assessments, encourage development planning and build a culture of feedback that drives performance. We drive a variety of focused initiatives specifically designed to support employee development. These include annual talent reviews and succession planning, leadership and executive development and company-sponsored education programs, such as management essentials to develop front-line leaders in foundational people management skills. New programs in 2022 included individualized leadership coaching, high-potential assessment programs, mentoring and sponsorship programs and skills development for technical staff in support of our digital transformation of our internal processes. Developing our employees helps create an engaged workforce that is ready to embrace future business challenges. It also helps mitigate risks associated with employee loss and keeping up with rapid technological and social change. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our annual turnover rate was 10%, or 8% on a voluntary basis.  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents Compensation and Benefits Program  Our compensation programs provide an opportunity for employees to earn higher compensation by aligning their performance, which may include contributions to our environmental, social and governance objectives, with our overall financial and operational success. The program includes three key elements: (i) competitive annual salaries, (ii) annual cash incentives and sales commission programs, with a majority of our employees eligible to earn more or less than the target opportunities based on both our and the employee's performance and (iii) long-term equity incentives with over half of employees receiving equity grants each year in the form of time-based restricted stock units and, in the case of senior leadership, time-based restricted stock units and performance stock units that vest, if at all, based on our financial performance and shareholder returns over a specified period of time. These grants align the long-term financial interests of our employees with those of our stockholders.  Health and welfare benefit programs include market-competitive benefits comprised of a mix of company-provided and other benefits, including those for medical, dental and vision insurance; life and disability insurance; defined contribution retirement plans; and global employee wellness programs in addition to many different employee assistance programs, such as financial, legal, emotional and social well-being employee assistance programs. Our investments in health and welfare benefits and other employee programs focus on providing choice and value to our employees so they can select market-competitive benefits that support their personal needs.  Local regulations are considered when developing our compensation and benefits packages for employees across the globe.  Safety, Health, and Flexibility  The health and safety of our employees and their families, our partners and our broad community around the world remain a high priority. We support a remote and hybrid work environment. In October 2022, we surveyed our employees and 92% responded favorably to the statement: \"I am able to manage my work responsibilities in a way that allows me flexibility.\" Our employees have responded favorably to how we work in a post-pandemic environment.  Employee Satisfaction and Engagement Employee feedback and engagement are critical to our success. We conduct global employee engagement surveys with the goal of using the feedback to improve the work environment and employee satisfaction. This feedback continues to be a critical component of our listening strategy. The survey itself has become an even more important tool to stay connected with employee sentiment in our remote and hybrid work environments. Our 2022 engagement score remained steady compared to 2021, confirming that our employees continue to be highly engaged. Our scores exceeded the external norm across all dimensions of engagement that were measured with themes this year, including: employees feeling valued and part of a team; employees empowered to excel; and trust in the future vision that leaders are creating. Employees are also satisfied with continued opportunities for learning and development. Employee feedback is also strong in other important areas including recognition, communication and overall leadership. The findings from these surveys help us to improve performance, manager effectiveness, culture and engagement.
