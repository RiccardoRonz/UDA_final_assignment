With our diverse portfolio that spans all key platforms and numerous genres, we strive to create the highest quality, most engaging interactive entertainment franchises and captivate our global audience. Most of our intellectual property is internally owned and developed, which we believe best positions us financially and competitively. We have established a portfolio of proprietary software content for the major hardware and mobile platforms in a wide range of genres, including action, adventure, family/casual, hyper-casual, role-playing, shooter, social casino, sports, and strategy, which we distribute worldwide. We believe that our commitment to creativity and innovation is a distinguishing strength, enabling us to differentiate our products in the marketplace by combining advanced technology with compelling storylines and characters that provide unique gameplay experiences for consumers. We have created, acquired, or licensed a group of highly recognizable brands to match the broad consumer demographics that we serve, ranging from adults to children and game enthusiasts to casual gamers. Another cornerstone of our strategy is to support the success of our products in the marketplace through innovative marketing programs and global distribution on platforms and through channels that are relevant to our target audience. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Support World-Class Creative Teams.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Creativity and innovation remain two of the core tenets of our organization and are the lifeblood of our ongoing success. We have 8,894 employees working in game development in studios around the world, including some of the most well-known names in the business. The creative teams at Rockstar Games, 2K, Private Division, and Zynga are renowned for their consistent ability to deliver games that set new benchmarks for excellence. In addition, Private Division is dedicated to bringing titles from top independent developers to market. Our teams balance the art and science of game making by combining creative innovation with a player-centric, data driven approach to delight players. We support our teams by focusing on talent acquisition and retention, and our label structure enables us to target distinct market sectors and opportunities. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Focus on Core Strength of Producing High Quality Titles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We focus on publishing a number of high-quality titles based on internally owned and developed intellectual properties. We currently own the intellectual property rights to 44 proprietary brands. In addition, we selectively develop titles based on licensed properties, including sports leagues, and also publish externally developed titles. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment, to review existing titles in development, and to assess titles after release by measuring their performance in the market and the return on our investment. We apply this process to all of our products, whether internally or externally developed. Our product investment review process includes reviews of each project at various stages of development by our executive management team and the senior management of our publishing labels and also includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of titles. This disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We develop our products using a combination of our internal development teams and external development resources acting under contract with us. We typically select external developers based on their track record and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre. One developer will generally produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to the original game. We believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources, which is designed to maintain our quality standards for our products. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leverage Emerging Technologies, Platforms, and Distribution Channels, Including Digitally-Delivered Content.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interactive entertainment, played online and on mobile, presents significant opportunities to enhance our growth and profitability. In addition, the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering the majority of content for traditional platforms through digital download. Virtually all of our products are available through direct digital download (from websites we own or third-party websites). We will continue to invest in emerging opportunities in mobile and online gameplay, particularly for our wholly-owned franchises, as well as downloadable content and microtransactions that enable gamers to pay to download additional content to enhance their game playing experience. We aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through virtual currency, add-on content, and in-game purchases.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expand International Business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The global market for interactive entertainment continues to grow, and we seek to increase our presence internationally, particularly in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. We are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in Asia, where our strategy is to build on our licensing relationships and also broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence, especially in China and South Korea. 2K has secured a multi-year license from the NBA to develop an online version of our NBA simulation game in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Our first such title, NBA 2K Online, a free-to-play NBA simulation game based on the console edition of NBA 2K,  2 2 2   which was co-developed by 2K and Tencent, is the top online PC sports game in China with over 60 million registered users. We have released two iterations of NBA 2K Online and continue to enhance the title with new features. We are also a direct publisher in Japan and South Korea. While we retain title to all intellectual property, in some regions, local publishers, under license agreements, are responsible for localization of software content, distribution, and marketing of the products in their respective local markets.  Our Businesses \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our interactive entertainment content, which includes the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by third parties, the sale of in-game virtual items and advertising, and live services on console, PC, and mobile. Operating margins are dependent in part upon our ability to release new, commercially successful software products and to manage effectively their development and marketing costs. We have internal development studios located in Australia, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, India, Serbia, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom (U.K.), and the United States (U.S.). As of March\u00a031, 2023, we had a research and development staff of 8,894 employees with the technical capabilities to develop software titles for all major consoles, PCs, and mobile platforms in multiple languages and territories. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agreements with third-party developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to make development payments, pay royalties based on product sales, and satisfy other conditions. Development payments for software titles are typically recoupable against royalties otherwise due to developers based on software sales. Our agreements with third-party developers generally provide us with the right to monitor development efforts and to cease making development payments if specified development milestones are not satisfied. We also regularly monitor the level of development payments in light of the expected sales for the related titles. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We continue to engage in evolving business models such as online gaming, virtual currency, add-on content, and in-game purchases, and we expect to continue to generate incremental revenue from these opportunities. We also generate revenue from advertising within our software products. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockstar Games.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockstar Games' strategy is to develop a limited number of titles that are known for their quality and longevity in the market for which they can create sequels and incremental revenue opportunities through virtual currency, add-on content, and in-game purchases. Software titles published by our Rockstar Games label are primarily internally-developed. We expect Rockstar Games, our wholly-owned publisher of the Grand Theft Auto, LA Noire, Max Payne, Midnight Club, Red Dead Redemption, and other popular franchises, to continue to be a leader in the action/adventure product category and to create groundbreaking entertainment. We believe that Rockstar Games has established a uniquely original, popular, cultural phenomenon with its Grand Theft Auto series, which is the interactive entertainment industry's most iconic and critically acclaimed brand and has sold-in over 395 million\u00a0units worldwide. Our most recent installment, Grand Theft Auto V, which was released in 2013, has sold-in over 180 million units worldwide and includes access to Grand Theft Auto Online. Red Dead Redemption 2, which has been a critical and commercial success that set numerous entertainment industry records, has sold-in more than 50 million units worldwide to date. Rockstar Games confirmed that active development for the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto franchise is well underway with more details to be shared over time. Rockstar Games continues to expand on its established series by developing sequels, offering downloadable episodes, and additional content. Rockstar Games' titles are published across all key platforms, including mobile. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02K.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our 2K label has published a variety of popular entertainment properties across all key platforms and across a range of genres including shooter, action, role-playing, strategy, sports, and family/casual entertainment. In recent years, 2K has expanded its offerings to include several new franchises that are expected to diversify its slate of games and provide opportunities for sequels and post-launch monetization. We expect 2K to continue to develop new, successful franchises in the future. 2K's internally owned and developed franchises include the critically acclaimed, multi-million unit selling BioShock, Mafia, Sid Meier's Civilization, and XCOM franchises. 2K also publishes externally developed franchises such as Borderlands and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. 2K's realistic sports simulation titles include our flagship NBA 2K series, which continues to be the top-ranked NBA basketball video game, the WWE\u00a02K professional wrestling series, and PGA TOUR 2K. In March 2020, 2K announced a multi-year partnership with the National Football League encompassing multiple future video games that will be non-simulation football game experiences. 2K also publishes mobile titles, including WWE SuperCard. We have expanded our relationship with the NBA through the NBA 2K League, a groundbreaking competitive gaming league jointly owned by us and the NBA. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Private Division.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Private Division label is dedicated to bringing titles from the industry's leading creative talent to market and is the publisher, developer, and owner of Kerbal Space Program and OlliOlli World. Kerbal Space Program 2 was released for early access in fiscal year 2023. Private Division also previously released The Outer Worlds and Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey. 3 3 3   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zynga.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Zynga label, which includes our former T2 Mobile Games label (which included Socialpoint, Playdots, and Nordeus) publishes popular free-to-play mobile games that deliver high quality, deeply engaging entertainment experiences and generates revenue from in-game sales and in-game advertising. Zynga's strategy is to have numerous games in concept development and to determine which titles are best suited for soft launch and worldwide launch based on the achievement of various milestones and KPI thresholds. Zynga's diverse portfolio of popular game franchises has been downloaded more than 6 billion times, including CSR Racing, Dragon City, Empires & Puzzles, FarmVille, Golf Rival, Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells, Merge Dragons, Merge Magic, Monster Legends, Toon Blast, Top Eleven, Toy Blast, Two Dots, Words With Friends, Zynga Poker, and a high volume of hyper-casual mobile titles, including Fill the Fridge!, Parking Jam 3D, Pressure Washing Run, and Pull the Pin. Zynga is also an industry-leading next-generation platform with the ability to acquire new users, cross-promote games, apply live services content updates, and optimize programmatic advertising and yields at scale through Chartboost, its leading mobile advertising and monetization platform. Intellectual Property \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our business is highly dependent on the creation, acquisition, licensing, and protection of intellectual property. We believe that content ownership facilitates our internal product development efforts and maximizes profit potential. We attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying, and distribution. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We also enter into content license agreements, such as those with sports leagues, players associations, copyrighted fictional characters and entertainment brands, car manufacturers, music labels, and musicians. These licenses are typically limited to the use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods. In addition, we license and include console manufacturer technology in our products on a non-exclusive basis, which allows our games to be played on their respective hardware systems. Manufacturing \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Platform manufacturers, such as Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, either manufacture or control the selection of approved manufacturers of physical copies of software products sold for use on their respective hardware platforms. We place a purchase order for the manufacture of our products with Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft's approved replicator and then send software code to the manufacturer, together with related artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures and packaging designs for approval, defect testing and manufacture. Games are generally shipped within two to three weeks of receipt of our purchase order and all materials. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our software titles typically carry a 90-day limited warranty. Arrangements with Platform Manufacturers  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have entered into license agreements with Sony and Microsoft to develop and publish software in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and certain Latin American, Middle Eastern, and African countries. We are not required to obtain any licenses from hardware manufacturers to develop titles for the PC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sony. Effective March 23, 2017, we entered into a PlayStation Global Developer and Publisher Agreement with Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, pursuant to which Sony granted us the right and license to develop, publish, have manufactured, market, advertise, distribute and sell PlayStation compatible products for all PlayStation systems. The agreement requires us to submit products to Sony for approval and for us to make royalty payments to Sony based on the number of units manufactured or revenue from digitally downloaded content. In addition, products for PlayStation systems are required to be manufactured by Sony-approved manufacturers. On September 30, 2020, we entered into a PlayStation 5 Amendment, with an effective date of May 1, 2020 (the \u201cPS5 Amendment\u201d), to our existing PlayStation Global Developer and Publisher Agreement. The PS5 Amendment amends the existing agreement to include the PlayStation 5 interactive entertainment system in the definition of systems in the agreement and to extend all of the terms and conditions of the existing agreement to our PlayStation 5 products and services. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The term of the agreement, as amended, expires on March 31, 2024, with automatic one-year renewal terms thereafter (unless one party gives the other notice of termination). Sony may terminate the agreement for any or no reason upon 30 days\u2019 notice. The agreement may also be terminated by Sony immediately in the event of a breach by us or our bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon expiration or termination of the agreement, we have certain rights to sell off existing inventories. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Microsoft. Under the terms of the license agreements that we have entered into with Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates, Microsoft granted us the right and license to develop, publish, have manufactured, market, advertise, distribute and sell Xbox compatible products. The agreements require us to submit products to Microsoft for approval and to make royalty  4 4 4   payments to Microsoft based on the number of units manufactured or revenue from digitally downloaded content. In addition, products for the Xbox consoles are required to be manufactured by Microsoft-approved manufacturers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective as of November 17, 2005, we entered into an Xbox 360 Publisher License Agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox 360 console (the \u201cXbox 360 Agreement\u201d). Effective as of July 1, 2020, we entered into an Xbox Console Publisher License Agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles (the \u201cXbox Next Gen Agreement\u201d and together with Xbox 360 Agreement, the \u201cXbox Agreements\u201d). The term of Xbox 360 Agreement expires on March 31, 2024, and the term of the Xbox Next Gen Agreement expires on March 31, 2024, each with automatic one-year renewal terms thereafter (unless one party gives the other advance notice of non-renewal). These Xbox Agreements may be terminated by Microsoft immediately in the event of a breach by us, and the Xbox Next Gen Agreement may also be terminated by Microsoft immediately in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon expiration or termination of each of the Xbox Agreements, we have certain rights to sell off existing inventories. Sales \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We sell software titles both digitally and physically through direct relationships with digital storefronts and platform partners, large retail customers, and third-party distributors. We sell our products globally and have sales operations in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We are dependent on a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our sales. Sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended March\u00a031, 2023, accounted for 79.6% of our net revenue, with Sony, Google, Apple, and Microsoft each accounting for more than 10.0% of our net revenue. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We also distribute our titles, add-on content, and in-game purchases through direct digital download to consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. We view digital distribution as an important growth opportunity for our industry and Company; however, we expect that packaged goods and traditional retailers will continue to be an important channel for the sale of our console products for the foreseeable future, particularly in connection with the release of certain titles for consoles or certain regions where digital distribution is not as well established. We also sell advertising within a number of our games. Our advertising offerings provide creative ways for marketers and advertisers to reach and engage with our players and are generally essential for our free-to-play titles. Our advertising offerings include banner and interstitial advertisements, engagement advertisements and offers in which players can participate in watch-to-earn engagements or other offer engagements, branded virtual items and sponsorships that integrate relevant advertising and messaging within game play, and advertising networks through which we offer a unified advertising platform that includes a demand side platform and supply side platform, as well as mediation capabilities. Marketing \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to acquire new users, maximize consumer interest in our titles, promote brand name recognition of our franchises, assist retailers and to properly position, package and merchandise our titles. Marketing is particularly important for our mobile titles to build a large community of players. From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers in connection with their own promotional efforts. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We market titles by: \u2022Implementing public relations campaigns, using social, digital, online, television, outdoor, and print marketing, including certain performance marketing programs. We believe that we label and market our products in accordance with the applicable principles and guidelines of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, (\"ESRB\"), an independent self-regulatory body that assigns ratings and enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry. \u2022Stimulating continued sales by reducing the wholesale prices of our products to retailers, digital storefronts, and platform providers at various times during the life of a product. Price protection may occur at any time in a product's life cycle, but typically occurs three to nine months after a product's initial launch. In certain international markets, we also provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product sales. \u2022Employing various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness, including social media, in-store promotions and point-of-purchase displays, direct mail, cooperative advertising, attendance at trade shows as well as product sampling through demonstration software distributed via the Internet or the digital online services. \u2022We have been able to build a large community of players, particularly for mobile titles, through players discovering of our games in platform storefronts, the viral and social features built into the network effects of our games, as well as the cross-promotion of our games to our existing audience. However, we also acquire our players through paid  5 5 5   advertising channels. We advertise our mobile games primarily within other mobile applications and on social networks, often through in-app and other advertising partners such as Facebook and Google. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of March\u00a031, 2023, we had a sales and marketing staff of 1,336 people. Competition \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our business, we compete with: \u2022Other interactive entertainment companies, including those offering mobile games, that range in size and cost structure from very small with limited resources to very large with greater financial, marketing, technical, and other resources than ours. Examples of our competitors include Activision Blizzard,\u00a0Inc., Electronic Arts\u00a0Inc., Embracer Group AB, Playrix, Playtika, Roblox, Scopely, Tencent, and Ubisoft Entertainment\u00a0S.A. We also expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications. \u2022Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo for the sale of interactive entertainment software. Each of these competitors is a large developer and marketer of software for their own platforms and has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns. \u2022Other software, hardware, entertainment, and media for limited retail shelf space and promotional resources. The competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support. \u2022Other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures, television, social networking, online computer applications, and other forms of entertainment, which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation, features, playability, product quality, brand name recognition, compatibility with popular platforms, access to distribution channels, price, marketing, and customer service. Our business is driven by hit titles, which require increasing budgets for development and marketing. Competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles. International Operations \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0International sales are a significant part of our business. For the fiscal years ended March\u00a031, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we earned 37.2%, 40.1% and 40.2%, respectively, of our net revenue outside the United States. We are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in Asia, where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence, especially in China and South Korea. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory, and economic developments, all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results. See Notes\u00a01 and 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment and Geographic Information \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have one operating and reportable segment. See Notes 1, 2, and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Human Capital \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Human Capital Management.  One of Take-Two\u2019s most important assets is our people. With 11,580 full-time employees as of March\u00a031, 2023, of which 7,064 were employed outside of the United States, we are constantly focused on our teams \u2013 their success, their structure, and how best to support them given their particular needs and projects. 46% of our employees are located in North America, 37% in Europe, and 17% in the Asia-Pacific region; 77% of our employees are focused on product development. While the repercussions of COVID-19 continue to be felt across the industry, over the past year, more of our employees have returned to office, and we are supporting a hybrid work environment within many teams. This evolving approach to the workplace presents new challenges for managing teams and supporting employees. In that vein, we are continuing existing programs and identifying others to ensure our people feel supported in their roles, including enhanced manager training to help strengthen teams despite the varied approaches to working, broadening our wellness and mental health offerings, encouraging people to step away from their screens when they can and spending a lot of time listening to employee feedback and encouraging employees to collaborate in person where appropriate and effective. Our hybrid approach to the workplace, where appropriate, enables our continued focus on creativity and innovation as two of the core tenets of our organization and the lifeblood of our ongoing success. The creative teams at our labels are  6 6 6   renowned for their consistent ability to deliver games that set new benchmarks for excellence. We support our creative and corporate teams by focusing on talent acquisition and retention, including through offering job development and skills training initiatives, extensive employee benefits and numerous well-being programs, and partnering with the leadership at our labels to foster the types of cultures our leaders believe best support and grow the creative processes for their particular teams. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG).  We recognize the synergies between corporate citizenship and smart business and are committed to focusing on, and measuring, the impact of our ESG activities, which are rooted in our core tenets of creativity, innovation, and efficiency. We believe ESG creates value for all stakeholders, employees and customers while also helping to mitigate risks, reduce costs, protect brand value, and identify market opportunities. We have an organization-wide ESG committee, overseen by the Board of Directors, to lead our ESG efforts. Through this committee, we developed a comprehensive, five-pillar ESG framework that reflects our top priority issues and stakeholder needs. In 2022, we made significant progress in managing our ESG performance. We are dedicated to driving positive change across our industry and society through our ESG efforts. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  We firmly believe that diverse teams are more valuable and effective, and that diversity is key to our success. We are committed to enhancing workforce diversity at Take-Two, and we strive to provide an inclusive workplace in which everyone feels respected, heard, and safe. We believe our culture of compassion and respect fosters a warm, welcoming environment for all qualified candidates and colleagues. Specific efforts we take include company-sponsored service projects in the communities in which we operate; providing financial and other support to organizations working to eradicate social injustice as well as providing educational, athletic, and other opportunities to underserved communities; working with organizations to support the rights of the LGBTIQ+ community; endeavoring to expand the diversity of our industry\u2019s candidate pool through scholarships to minority game design students and contributions to organizations providing STEM opportunities to children in underserved communities; delivering interview training and career counseling to young adults in those same communities; and celebrating cultural differences through various employee affinity groups and company events and offerings. Talent Assessment & Development and Employee Experience.  We strongly believe in internal growth opportunities and career development tracks. We also recognize the importance of our employees staying current in an ever-changing industry. To that end, our global Learning & Development team curates a wide variety of training materials and programs targeting both hard skills development and career progression as well as programs in leadership development and employee round tables. Further, our compliance training program seeks to ensure that our employees recognize and report any signs of harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or other inappropriate behaviors in the workplace and that they understand and abide by our Code of Business Conduct and other internal policies. Our learning and development programs are designed to be closely aligned with our performance management process and succession planning. Our formalized performance management process provides the platform for evaluating each individual employee\u2019s contributions to the team and our success, with a focus on regular communication and transparency. We work hard to ensure that development opportunities are individually tailored and that all decisions regarding hiring, career progression, and compensation are based on qualifications, work ethic, and job performance.  Beyond formal performance management, we stay connected with our teams throughout the year with global town hall meetings, engagement and \"pulse\" surveys, culture assessments and employee round tables. The feedback generated through these tools helps to ensure we are providing a supportive, dynamic, and stimulating work environment for all of our employees. These efforts and more contributed to Take-Two being named one of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Best Managed US Companies in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and included in Forbes' Best Mid-Size Employers list in 2019, 2021, and 2022. In addition, we were included on Fortune\u2019s Great Places to Work list in 2020, 2021, and 2022 and were recently honored by Gay Gaming Professionals in 2021 as a DEI&B leader in the interactive entertainment industry. Compensation and Benefits.  The main objectives of our compensation and benefit programs are to attract, retain, motivate, and reward our employees, who operate in a highly competitive and technologically challenging environment. We offer competitive compensation packages designed to incentivize high individual and company performance. We regularly review our compensation and benefits packages from both an internal and external standpoint to ensure competitiveness, including through industry benchmarking analysis. We seek to link compensation (including annual changes in compensation) to our overall and business unit performance, as well as each individual\u2019s contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on our overall performance is intended to align our employees\u2019 financial interests with the interests of our shareholders. In addition to awarding Restricted Stock Units to employees at certain levels, we also offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan to further align the interests of our employees with our shareholders. We also provide a comprehensive benefits package that includes traditional offerings, such as medical, dental vision, retirement, disability, accident and life insurance, prescription drugs, and leaves, and also includes programs such as well-being,  7 7 7   fitness reimbursement, mental health benefits, mental health awareness training for Human Resources personnel and managers throughout the Company, and charitable giving with a company match.
