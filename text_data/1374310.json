These proprietary products are built through Cboe Labs, a dedicated team centered on the creation, development, and implementation of new ideas and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers, which are both described below in further detail. Our most frequently traded proprietary products include SPX options and VIX options and futures.    SPX OptionsThe S&P 500 Index is an index comprised of 500 large-cap U.S. listed companies. It is one of the most commonly followed indices and is considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy. The SPX options we offer on the S&P 500 Index are exclusive to Cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees. Because of the S&P 500 Index\u2019s status as a bellwether, SPX options are used in many different trading strategies by customers with different goals, including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options, asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using risk-managed strategies to capture so-called \u201crisk premia\u201d embedded in option prices. We also offer Mini- and Nano-SPX options, FLEX- and FLEX micro-SPX options, and SPX Weeklys options, which have settlements on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and on the last trading day of each month and 24x5 trading in SPX options. We believe these additional expirations provide customers with more precision when hedging overall portfolio risk. Volatility TradingCboe pioneered the trading of exchange-traded volatility products with its introduction of VIX futures in 2004 and VIX options in 2006. The VIX Index (as defined below), although not directly tradable, is based on the mid-point of real-time quotes of SPX options and is designed to reflect investors\u2019 consensus view of future 30-day expected stock market volatility. The VIX methodology provides the basis for the creation of VIX options and futures. The final settlement value of VIX derivatives is determined on their expiration date through a Special Opening Quotation (\u201cSOQ\u201d) of the VIX Index. The SOQ calculation uses opening trade prices of selected options; unless there is no opening price, in which case the opening price used in the SOQ calculation is the midpoint of the highest bid and lowest offer at the time of the opening. Since we started offering these products, we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies, including hedging extreme stock market declines, also known as \u201ctail risk\u201d hedging, and risk-managed strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future. We also offer VIX Weeklys options and futures, mini VIX futures, and nearly 24x5 trading in VIX options and futures to provide investors with additional tools to trade volatility.  Proprietary IndicesWe also calculate and disseminate proprietary indices that are licensed for use by third parties or are used as the basis for other proprietary products. These proprietary indices are built both through our in-house research and development staff of the Data and Access Solutions business and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers, which are both described below in further detail. Our proprietary indices include:\u25cfvolatility indices based on broad-based market indices, such as the S&P\u00a0500 and the Russell 2000, \u25cfvolatility indices based on ETFs, and \u25cfoptions strategy benchmark indices, such as the Cboe BuyWrite, PutWrite and Collar indices based on the S&P\u00a0500 and Russell 2000, BuyWrite and PutWrite indices based on MSCI EAFE and MSCI Emerging Markets, and BuyWrite indices based on other broad-based market indices.In addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indices, we have granted licenses for third parties to use and sublicense some of these proprietary indices to create third-party indices and products. Accordingly, we generate revenue from proprietary indices by distributing them for reference purposes, using them as the basis for proprietary products and licensing them for use for third-party indices and products.  11 Table of Contents Table of Contents Proprietary ProductsIn addition to operating cash and spot markets and derivative markets, and providing data and access solutions, we are a leader in the volatility space with the proprietary products we offer for trading.

Digital assets of customers (but not those of Cboe Digital) are commingled in the omnibus wallets, and Cboe Digital maintains the records of the amount and type of digital asset owned by each of its customers in omnibus wallets. Cboe Digital does not commingle its own corporate assets with the customer digital assets in the omnibus wallets, other than corporate assets that are held in omnibus wallets to facilitate customer transactions relating to the digital assets contained in the omnibus wallet, including in order to pay customary transaction fees and expenses. Because Cboe Digital does not have a trading entity for proprietary or  Our trading platforms have generally experienced very low operational downtime and low latency. The trading platforms use readily available hardware, thereby minimizing capital outlays required for each new market entry. Also, in order to continue to implement new enhancements to our trading platforms, new releases of software are generally deployed routinely in all of the applicable markets. Disaster Recovery We operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities for all of our markets. We expect that the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period of time and in certain instances we work with our market participants to try to quickly reopen marketplaces. We regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests using our back-up data centers, as well as an annual test with our U.S. trading participants. In Canada, as required by local regulations, NEO and MATCHNow conduct internal testing of their disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually, and they participate in the bi-annual testing coordinated by the self-regulatory organization formerly known as IIROC and now known as the New Self-Regulatory Organization of Canada (the \u201cCanadian SRO\u201d). Cboe Australia, NEO and Cboe Japan conduct internal testing of their disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually. In Europe, we also regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests which use our back-up data center, as well as an annual test with our European trading participants. We continue to work to improve both the availability of our technology and our disaster recovery facilities. Routing and Clearing OCC is the sole provider of clearing on all of our U.S. options and futures exchanges. National Securities Clearing Corporation (\u201cNSCC\u201d), a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (\u201cDTC\u201d), is the sole provider of clearing on our U.S. listed equity exchanges. The Canadian Depository for Securities (\u201cCDS\u201d) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on MATCHNow and NEO. With respect to Australian equities and derivatives, Cboe Australia delivers matched trades of its customers to ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Settlement Pty Ltd. ASX Clear Pty Ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Australia. The Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (\u201cJSCC\u201d) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on Cboe Japan\u2019s Chi-Alpha, Chi-Select, Chi-Match and Kai-X. BofA Securities, Inc. (\u201cBOA\u201d) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on BIDS Trading.

Cboe Digital Exchange relies on Cboe Clear Digital to clear digital asset trades. Cboe Trading is a routing broker-dealer used by our four U.S. equities exchanges and our four U.S. options exchanges, including the electronic platform portion of Cboe Options. Cboe Trading\u2019s clearing firms are Wedbush Securities, Inc. (\u201cWedbush\u201d) and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d). Digital Assets and Recent Developments Cboe Digital is an operator of a U.S. based digital asset spot market, a regulated futures exchange, and a regulated clearinghouse. As described in further detail below, Cboe Digital does not engage in proprietary trading activities and does not maintain a trading entity. Cboe Digital does not itself trade digital assets, does not trade on its own exchange, and does not maintain an affiliate trading entity for purposes of trading, market making, or liquidity provision on its exchange. Cboe Clear Digital maintains its own operating funds in separate bank accounts at separate banking institutions from where it maintains customer accounts. In addition, customer accounts and institutional accounts are maintained at separate banking institutions. Each bank account and digital wallet is appropriately titled in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements thus helping to ensure that customer assets are clearly denoted as such. Cboe Digital takes several steps to isolate the digital assets held for customers from its own assets and to structure customer accounts in a way that reinforces customer ownership of digital assets. Primarily, Cboe Digital holds customer digital assets separate from its own assets in customer accounts, referred to as wallets, either through a third-party custodian, a licensed trust company, or in separate and distinct wallets managed by Cboe Digital. Customer digital assets are held in omnibus wallets titled for the benefit of customers of Cboe Digital. Digital assets of customers (but not those of Cboe Digital) are commingled in the omnibus wallets, and Cboe Digital maintains the records of the amount and type of digital asset owned by each of its customers in omnibus wallets. Cboe Digital does not commingle its own corporate assets with the customer digital assets in the omnibus wallets, other than corporate assets that are held in omnibus wallets to facilitate customer transactions relating to the digital assets contained in the omnibus wallet, including in order to pay customary transaction fees and expenses. Because Cboe Digital does not have a trading entity for proprietary or  17 17  Table of Contentsliquidity trading purposes, Cboe Digital maintains its own digital assets only to facilitate customer trading. Cboe Digital does not currently pledge, rehypothecate, or invest customer digital assets, although its customer agreements and rulebook permit it to do so in the future. Additionally, Cboe Digital does not otherwise use customer digital assets for its own corporate or business purposes.Further, Cboe Digital holds customers\u2019 digital assets custodially through self-custody and its accounts with custodians, such as banks or such other cryptocurrency custodial institutions selected by us to act as custodians. Cboe Digital\u2019s custody strategy is designed to maximize liquidity and efficient access to assets by making those assets readily available. Cboe Digital monitors its cash and the digital asset balances it maintains with custodians. Digital assets require control of one or more unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which the digital assets are held. The networks require one or more private keys relating to a digital wallet to authorize a spending transaction. If private keys are lost or destroyed, this could prevent the ability to transfer the corresponding digital asset. Security breaches, computer malware, and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in digital asset markets. Cboe Digital has committed to securely store digital assets it holds on behalf of users. As such, Cboe Digital may be liable to its users for losses arising from theft or loss of user private keys. Cboe Digital has no reason to believe it will incur any expense associated with such potential liability because (i) it has no known or historical experience of claims to use as a basis of measurement, (ii) it accounts for and continually verifies the amount of digital assets within its control, and (iii) it has established security around custodial private keys to minimize the risk of theft or loss.Also, Cboe Digital is exposed to risk with respect to digital asset prices and valuations which are largely based on the supply and demand for those digital assets in financial markets. Cboe Digital\u2019s valuation governance framework includes numerous controls and other procedural safeguards that are intended to maximize the quality of fair value measurements. New products and valuation techniques are reviewed and approved by senior management. Cboe Digital\u2019s valuation process for digital assets are fair value estimates that are also validated by the finance control function independently. Independent price verification is performed by finance control through benchmarking fair value estimates with observable market prices or other independent sources. Reasonably designed controls and governance framework are in place and are intended to help ensure quality third-party pricing sources were used. Cboe Clear Digital clears cryptocurrencies from 51 U.S. jurisdictions authorized by license or not subject to licensing. Cboe Clear Digital performs a guarantee function whereby Cboe Clear Digital helps to ensure that the obligations of the transactions it clears are fulfilled. Spot trading is either cleared on a fully funded basis or by providing non-material daily trading limits to certain well-qualified institutional clearing members. In order to help mitigate the impact of any potential default by such a clearing member, extension of any trading limits is accompanied by performing credit due diligence, requiring posting of collateral or other forms of financial guarantee and hard pre-trade limits. Cboe Digital does not allow access from unauthorized or impermissible jurisdictions, and has taken active steps to help prevent such access and to help prevent circumvention of our controls. To help ensure an orderly market, Cboe Digital maintains digital assets to support its clearing operations which may be subject to significant changes in value and therefore exposed to market risk with the fluctuation in market prices. Cboe Digital monitors this risk on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. The business model is such that Cboe Digital earns digital assets and at times may accumulate positions that are subject to market risk. Customer positions do have market risk based on daily activity and settlement prices.While Cboe Digital and its vendors have experienced in the past cybersecurity threats and events of varying degrees, we are not aware of any of these threats or events having a material impact on Cboe Digital\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results to date. However, there can be no assurance that we or our vendors and custodians will not experience future threats or events that may be material. If any such threats or events materialize, we may be subject to contractual restrictions, liability and damages, loss of business, penalties, unfavorable publicity, and increased scrutiny by regulators, which may have an adverse effect on our business.The pending bankruptcy of FTX and the bankruptcies of other digital asset platforms has brought increased scrutiny to the digital asset industry. While FTX\u2019s pending bankruptcy and the bankruptcies of other digital asset platforms has not had a direct material effect on Cboe\u2019s overall business or financial condition, Cboe\u2019s sole exposure to such bankruptcies was FTX and it was through Cboe\u2019s entitlement to an immaterial amount of Pyth tokens, which were held on the FTX exchange and were not received in exchange for Cboe participating on the Pyth network.See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for more information regarding Cboe Digital.18 Table of Contents Table of Contents liquidity trading purposes, Cboe Digital maintains its own digital assets only to facilitate customer trading.

The following is a brief discussion of recent regulatory developments that may significantly impact our business.United StatesConsolidated Data Plan OrderOn May 6, 2020, the SEC issued an order (the \u201cConsolidated Data Plan Order\u201d) that would require U.S. equities exchanges and FINRA to develop and file a new consolidated data plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) that would replace the three current U.S. equities tape data plans and require certain governance provisions, such as changes to the voting structure. Pursuant to the Consolidated Data Plan Order, we and the other U.S. equities exchanges and FINRA were required to file the proposed Plan for public comment before the SEC took any definitive action on such new plan. The proposed Plan was filed on August 11, 2020 and on August 6, 2021 the SEC approved such Plan. The Plan was subsequently challenged by exchanges and the courts granted a stay of the Plan. On July 5, 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court upheld parts of the Consolidated Data Plan Order, while vacating certain of its other requirements including the Plan\u2019s requirements regarding the voting structure. As such, the current data plans will continue to govern. Our equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, may require additional resources to comply with or challenge the Consolidated Data Plan Order and the Plan may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there is a negative impact on the applicable market data revenues that we receive that are generated from such new plan. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for more information.Market Data Infrastructure RuleOn December 9, 2020, the SEC issued a Market Data Infrastructure Final Rule (\u201cMDIR\u201d), which makes significant additions to the content available on the Securities Information Processors (\u201cSIPs\u201d) and replaces the exclusive processors with a competing consolidator model. The MDIR was subsequently challenged by several exchanges in court, but was upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court on May 24, 2022. In connection with the MDIR\u2019s requirements, the exchanges filed fee amendments for the new market data content required under the MDIR,as well as non-fee amendments, which were subsequently disapproved by the SEC on September 21, 2022. Because the implementation of the MDIR is predicated on the approval of the fee and non-fee amendments, the MDIR has yet to take effect. Until such time, the SEC orders the exchanges to file new fee and non-fee amendments, the MDIR is at a standstill. However, should MDIR be implemented, the new rules could cause Cboe\u2019s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with the new rules and they may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there are lower SIP plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for more information.Equity Market Structure In December 2022, the SEC released four proposals that could impact equity market structure: (1) Disclosure of Order Execution Information (Rule 605); (2) Regulation NMS Amendments: Tick Size, Access Fees, and Transparency; (3) Regulation Best Execution; and (4) Proposed Rule to Enhance Order Competition. These proposals have been noticed for public comment. If adopted as-is, final implementation of these equity market structure proposals could occur in late 2024 and 2025 and could result in market technology changes and additional compliance costs to Cboe.

Equity Market Structure  In December 2022, the SEC released four proposals that could impact equity market structure: (1) Disclosure of Order Execution Information (Rule 605); (2) Regulation NMS Amendments: Tick Size, Access Fees, and Transparency; (3) Regulation Best Execution; and (4) Proposed Rule to Enhance Order Competition. These proposals have been noticed for public comment. If adopted as-is, final implementation of these equity market structure proposals could occur in late 2024 and 2025 and could result in market technology changes and additional compliance costs to Cboe. Further, it is possible that additional proposals or changes to the existing equity market structure, which could have a negative  19 19  Table of Contentsimpact on our operations.

An Action Plan of concrete steps was set out in September 2015, and an update of the list of initiatives was published in September 2016. In November 2019, the E.C. set up a High Level Forum on CMU, resulting in a final report published in June 2020. On September 24, 2020, the E.C. published a new CMU Action Plan, and on November 25, 2021, published a set of legislative proposals in furtherance of the CMU, including proposals to amend the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (\u201cMiFIR\u201d) described in the EU Transparency Rules section below. This therefore remains an ongoing project for the E.C., which may result in additional regulation or legislation. In November 2021 the EU Commission published an update regarding progress against the CMU Action Plan alongside a number of new legislative proposals designed to contribute to the objectives of CMU.

The rules introduce a reporting obligation for OTC derivatives markets, a clearing obligation for eligible OTC derivatives markets, measures to reduce counterparty credit and operational risk for bilateral OTC derivatives markets, CCPs, and trade repositories, and rules on the establishment of interoperability between CCPs. EMIR was enhanced and amended in June 2019. In December 2022, the EU Commission published a proposal to further amend EMIR with the primary goal of making EU clearing services more attractive to market participants.

The CEA and CFTC regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded, and for a trading platform to be designated as a swap execution facility on which certain swaps may be traded. Designation as a contract market or swap execution facility for the trading of specified futures or swaps contracts is non-exclusive. This means that the CFTC may permit additional exchanges or trading platforms to be contract markets or swap execution facilities for trading the same or similar contracts.

The Chief Executive Officer of BIDS Trading is expected to lead BIDS Trading as an independent business within Cboe, reporting into an independent committee of the board of Cboe Global Markets. Further, Cboe Trading will not route orders to BIDS Trading on behalf of the Exchanges. Cboe Global Markets Certain aspects of Cboe Global Markets are also subject to SEC, FCA and AFM oversight, including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders. The focus of the SEC\u2019s regulation of Cboe Global Markets is to assure fair representation of members in the selection of the directors of the Exchanges, public participation in the governance of the Exchanges and that the Exchanges can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the Exchange Act. Furthermore, the SEC requires that Cboe Global Markets give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the self-regulatory function of the Exchanges\u00a0and to Cboe Global Markets\u2019 obligations to investors and the general public. The SEC also requires that Cboe Global Markets not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the Board of Directors of any of the Exchanges relating to its regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of such Exchange to carry out its responsibilities under the  24 24  Table of ContentsExchange Act. To the extent that Cboe Global Markets\u2019 business activities involve or relate to the Exchanges, the officers and directors of Cboe Global Markets may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws. Accordingly, the SEC may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain Cboe Global Markets\u2019 activities and those activities may be subject to SEC approval and, in some cases, public notice and comment.      In addition, Cboe Global Markets indirectly holds all of the issued share capital and voting rights in Cboe Europe and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cboe Chi-X Europe and Cboe NL. As a result, we and any person who holds, or has voting power with respect to, 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Cboe Global Markets common stock may be subject to certain regulatory requirements under UK and Dutch law.

On November 15, 2016, the SEC approved the CAT. The first of various phases of CAT was originally required to begin in November  26 26  Table of Contents2017; however, there were some delays. In 2017, Thesys CAT LLC (\u201cThesys\u201d), a subsidiary of Thesys Technologies, LLC, was selected as the plan processor with the responsibility to build and operate the CAT. The first phase of CAT (\u201cPhase 1\u201d) ultimately went live in November 2018, at which time we and other SROs/Plan Participants began initial reporting of order and trade file submissions to the CAT. In 2019, Thesys was replaced by a new plan processor, FINRA CAT, LLC, a subsidiary of FINRA. The second phase of CAT (\u201cPhase 2\u201d) for Industry Member began with order and trade file submissions in June 2020 (Phase 2a for NMS stocks and OTC equities) and July 2020 (Phase 2b for listed options), Additional sub-phases (Phases 2c and 2d) related to order and trade file submissions were implemented by December 2021. While the final Phase 2 implementation sub-phase (Phase 2e), related to Industry Member submissions to the customer and account information submissions system (\u201cCAIS\u201d) is live in production, its completion is delayed and further delay is anticipated. On May 15, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to the CAT to establish financial accountability provisions to achieve full CAT implementation, including a financial accountability milestone requiring full implementation of the CAT requirements by December 30, 2022. If the SEC were to determine any financial accountability milestone was not met, it may limit the SROs\u2019/Plan Participants\u2019 recovery of certain costs. Due to the delayed completion of CAIS, the SROs/Plan Participants have submitted to the SEC requests to extend the timeline for the completion of Phase 2e and the deadline for the final financial accountability milestone and additional requests may be submitted. If the SEC does not grant extensions and finds that the SROs/Plan Participants did not satisfy the related last financial accountability milestone, it could result in the SROs/Plan Participants not being able to recover certain costs associated with this final sub-phase, which amount of unrecoverable costs may increase for additional delays.While the funding of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the SROs/Plan Participants (which includes our U.S.-based securities exchanges) and Industry Members, until the CAT funding model is approved by the SEC and related fee filings associated with the funding model are effective, the funding to date has solely been provided by the SROs/Plan Participants. The funding by the SROs/Plan Participants has been done in exchange for promissory notes, a portion of which is expected to be repaid by the Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC to the SROs/Plan Participants once Industry Member fees are collected by the Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC pursuant to the CAT funding model. Until those fees are collected and remitted, the SROs/Plan Participants may continue to incur additional significant costs, or result in the uncollectibility of portions of promissory notes related to the funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT. See Note 8 (\u201cCredit Losses\u201d) and Note 9 (\u201cOther Assets, Net\u201d) for further information.The SROs/Plan Participants formed the Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC to implement CAT requirements. On December 16, 2020, the SEC issued two exemptive orders regarding the CAT (\u201cDecember 2020 Orders\u201d). In February 2021, Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC: (1) filed with the SEC motions to stay all or portions of the December 2020 Orders, and (2) petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\u201cD.C. Circuit\u201d) for judicial review of the December 2020 Orders asserting that the orders are unlawful. On March 3, 2021, the D.C. Circuit granted an unopposed motion to hold the litigation in abeyance. On May 10, 2022, the D.C. Circuit granted a motion to lift the abeyance. On July 8, 2022, the SEC issued an Order Granting Temporary Conditional Relief that superseded the December 2020 Orders (\u201cThird Order\u201d). On August 3, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation of voluntary dismissal of the litigation as being moot in light of the Third Order, which the D.C. Circuit granted on August 5, 2022. On September 6, 2022, Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC petitioned the D.C. Circuit for judicial review of the Third Order asserting the order was unlawful. On October 3, 2022, the D.C.

In 2017, Thesys CAT LLC (\u201cThesys\u201d), a subsidiary of Thesys Technologies, LLC, was selected as the plan processor with the responsibility to build and operate the CAT. The first phase of CAT (\u201cPhase 1\u201d) ultimately went live in November 2018, at which time we and other SROs/Plan Participants began initial reporting of order and trade file submissions to the CAT. In 2019, Thesys was replaced by a new plan processor, FINRA CAT, LLC, a subsidiary of FINRA. The second phase of CAT (\u201cPhase 2\u201d) for Industry Member began with order and trade file submissions in June 2020 (Phase 2a for NMS stocks and OTC equities) and July 2020 (Phase 2b for listed options), Additional sub-phases (Phases 2c and 2d) related to order and trade file submissions were implemented by December 2021. While the final Phase 2 implementation sub-phase (Phase 2e), related to Industry Member submissions to the customer and account information submissions system (\u201cCAIS\u201d) is live in production, its completion is delayed and further delay is anticipated. On May 15, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to the CAT to establish financial accountability provisions to achieve full CAT implementation, including a financial accountability milestone requiring full implementation of the CAT requirements by December 30, 2022. If the SEC were to determine any financial accountability milestone was not met, it may limit the SROs\u2019/Plan Participants\u2019 recovery of certain costs. Due to the delayed completion of CAIS, the SROs/Plan Participants have submitted to the SEC requests to extend the timeline for the completion of Phase 2e and the deadline for the final financial accountability milestone and additional requests may be submitted. If the SEC does not grant extensions and finds that the SROs/Plan Participants did not satisfy the related last financial accountability milestone, it could result in the SROs/Plan Participants not being able to recover certain costs associated with this final sub-phase, which amount of unrecoverable costs may increase for additional delays.While the funding of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the SROs/Plan Participants (which includes our U.S.-based securities exchanges) and Industry Members, until the CAT funding model is approved by the SEC and related fee filings associated with the funding model are effective, the funding to date has solely been provided by the SROs/Plan Participants. The funding by the SROs/Plan Participants has been done in exchange for promissory notes, a portion of which is expected to be repaid by the Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC to the SROs/Plan Participants once Industry Member fees are collected by the Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC pursuant to the CAT funding model. Until those fees are collected and remitted, the SROs/Plan Participants may continue to incur additional significant costs, or result in the uncollectibility of portions of promissory notes related to the funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT. See Note 8 (\u201cCredit Losses\u201d) and Note 9 (\u201cOther Assets, Net\u201d) for further information.The SROs/Plan Participants formed the Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC to implement CAT requirements. On December 16, 2020, the SEC issued two exemptive orders regarding the CAT (\u201cDecember 2020 Orders\u201d).

Circuit\u201d) for judicial review of the December 2020 Orders asserting that the orders are unlawful. On March 3, 2021, the D.C. Circuit granted an unopposed motion to hold the litigation in abeyance. On May 10, 2022, the D.C. Circuit granted a motion to lift the abeyance. On July 8, 2022, the SEC issued an Order Granting Temporary Conditional Relief that superseded the December 2020 Orders (\u201cThird Order\u201d).
