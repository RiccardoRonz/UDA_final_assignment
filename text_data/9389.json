The company was organized in 1880 and incorporated in the state of Indiana, United States of America (U.S.), in 1922. Our sustainable, aluminum packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in\u00a0facilities around the world. We also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers within our aerospace segment. In 2022, our total consolidated net sales were $15.35 billion. Our packaging businesses were responsible for 87 percent of our net sales, with the remaining 13\u00a0percent contributed by our aerospace business. \u200b Our largest product line is aluminum beverage containers and we also produce extruded aluminum aerosol containers, recloseable aluminum bottles across multiple consumer categories, aluminum slugs and aluminum cups. \u200b We sell our aluminum packaging products globally to large multinational beverage, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands, as well as to numerous regional customers. Our significant customers include top consumer packaging and beverage companies. \u200b Our aerospace business is a leader in delivering solutions ranging from entire missions to contributing component level expertise through the design, development and manufacture of innovative systems for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, civil, commercial and national security aerospace markets. It produces spacecraft, instruments and sensors, radio frequency systems and components, data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced technologies and products that enable weather prediction and climate change monitoring as well as deep space missions. \u200b We are headquartered in Westminster, Colorado, and our stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BALL. \u200b Our Strategy  \u200b Our Drive for 10 vision defines our overall business strategy. At its highest level, Drive for 10 is a mindset around perfection, with a greater sense of urgency around our future success. Launched in 2011, Drive for 10 encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our businesses and achieving long-term success. These five levers are: \u200b \u200b We also maintain a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on improving shareholder returns by: \u200b \u200b 4 4 4  Table of ContentsThe cash generated by our businesses is used primarily: (1)\u00a0to finance the company\u2019s operations, (2)\u00a0to fund growth capital investments, (3)\u00a0to service the company\u2019s debt and (4) to return value to our shareholders via stock buybacks and dividend payments. From time to time, we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible transactions that we believe will benefit the company and our shareholders, which may include strategic acquisitions, divestitures of parts of our company or equity investments. At any time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible transactions or may have entered into non-binding letters of intent. There can be no assurance if or when we will enter into any such transactions or the terms of such transactions. The compensation of many of our employees is tied directly to the company\u2019s performance through our EVA\u00ae-based incentive programs.\u200bSustainability and Circularity\u200bAt Ball Corporation, we believe in our people, our culture and our ability to deliver value to our stakeholders. Like uncompromising integrity and customer focus, sustainability and circularity are part of our Drive for 10 vision and have been a part of who we are since our founding in 1880. \u200bOur triple bottom-line approach to sustainability \u2013 environmental, economic and social \u2013 has evolved over the past 20 years and, together with our objective of providing truly circular economic solutions for our customers, is the lens through which we continue to conduct business at every level of our organization. Sustainability and circularity constitute a key part of our business strategy and influence how we manage and operate our businesses, serve our customers, care for the environment and our communities, secure profits and drive long-term prosperity. \u200bWe focus our sustainability and circularity efforts on environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts through the lenses of product stewardship and social impacts, exhibited through our commitment to achieve a science-based 55 percent reduction in our greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint by 2030 and net zero carbon emissions prior to 2050, as well as human capital management, including diversity and inclusion, and community engagement. In our manufacturing operations around the world, we work on continuous improvement of employee safety and engagement, energy and water efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, waste reduction and recycling. Our commitment extends beyond our walls and includes purchasing aluminum from certified sustainable sources and reducing value chain emissions in order to facilitate achievement of Ball\u2019s and its customers\u2019 GHG reduction objectives. \u200bToday\u2019s consumers are choosing brands based on their sustainability and circularity credentials. Ball customers understand this growing priority and their unique position in impacting the environment, especially through the packaging materials they use. Infinitely recyclable aluminum unlocks the full potential of packaging to help customers convey their values and purpose to consumers. We are committed to moving toward a truly circular economy, where materials can be \u2013 and actually are \u2013 used again and again.\u200bAluminum cans, bottles and cups are an attractive option for sustainability-conscious brands with commitments to real world recyclability and increasing their usage of recycled materials in consumer packaging. Unlike plastic, glass, cartons or compostable containers, aluminum containers are designed to be recycled infinitely without losing quality and retain a high economic value, pushing aluminum collection, sorting and recycling rates to the highest of any beverage packaging material. That is why 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced is still in use today. In addition, growing sustainability compliance costs for substrates with less favorable circularity credentials continue to see their costs of ownership rise in several regions.\u200bAluminum beverage packaging is the leader in real recycling, where the package is collected and then transformed into an item of equal value (product-to-product or material-to-material recycling). In the case of aluminum cans, bottles or cups, which are monomaterial, the aluminum can be recycled and made back into the same product in as little as 60 days. In contrast, only 10 percent of all plastic ever produced has been recycled and is mostly only downcycled. Downcycled products, including but not limited to when plastic is converted to become part of a sneaker or fibers in a carpet, are not sustainable because eventually those products end up in landfills. Real recycling happens when the value of the product being recycled is maintained from one use to another. \u200bBecause recycling aluminum saves resources and uses significantly less energy than primary aluminum production, we are innovating and collaborating with our customers, supply chain, industry groups and other public and private partners to establish and financially support initiatives to increase recycling rates around the world. We work together to create effective collection and recycling systems and educate consumers about the sustainability and circularity benefits of aluminum packaging.

We have also strengthened our succession planning through a holistic approach to developing key managers that includes challenging assignments, formal development plans and professional coaching. \u200bTraining and Development\u200bOur global human capital management platform enables rigorous identification, analysis and development of talent around the world. In conjunction with that platform, the company utilizes an approach to performance management focused on development and continuous improvement. This approach emphasizes ongoing performance conversations between managers and employees and a focus on mitigating bias in performance conversations, resulting in an enhanced employee developmental experience and data points for our talent discussions. Additionally, all employees have access to create a personal development plan and we have resources to support employees in their personal and professional development, including:\u200b\u25cfContinuous education through various tuition reimbursement programs, apprenticeship and instructional programs;\u25cfA learning management platform that has had significant employee utilization;\u25cfMonthly global leadership panel discussions and breakout groups focused on real-time topics, such as supporting team wellbeing, working through stressful times, setting individual development goals, maximizing team performance, sharing practical steps to better enable our collective focus on D&I and sharing other best practice leadership behaviors;\u25cfA new LinkedIn Learning platform for all corporate and packaging employees who work in an office setting;\u25cfLeadership and personal development coaching opportunities by teaming with BetterUp;\u25cfOn-going education for people leaders around our Inspire, Connect, and Achieve leadership behaviors; and\u25cfAnnual compliance, antitrust, bribery, corruption and business code of conduct and ethics training for key management level, sales and supply chain employees.7 Table of Contents Table of Contents progress on D&I, which has been recognized by external organizations, including Forbes, which recognized Ball among \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity\u201d in 2019, the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), which recognized Ball as a best place to work for disability inclusion on the 2022 Disability Equality Index, and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which listed Ball among the \u201cBest Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality\u201d in five out of the last six years, including a perfect score on its Corporate Equality Index list in 2021 and 2022.

Going into 2023, we plan to introduce tools for inclusion in our learning management system to enhance the unconscious bias training we provide to our global workforce. We will also enhance the purpose and mission of our BNIs to better serve overall business objectives and will be preparing to launch an Inclusion Council led by our Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion and sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer. We continue to evolve our talent acquisition process and focus on diversity for internships, candidate slates, interview panels, talent reviews and succession planning. Each of our business segment leaders has committed to help drive further D&I progress during 2023 and beyond. Currently, 67 percent of our board of directors is either gender or ethnically diverse, including five female board members, and 44 percent of our company\u2019s executive leadership team is either gender or ethnically diverse.\u200bTalent\u200bWe seek to attract, develop and retain the best talent throughout the company. During the past decade, we established and expanded our talent management organization with dedicated talent acquisition and development functions that have implemented rigorous hiring and development processes, including standardized assessments for candidate selection, and an embedded \u201cInspire, Connect, Achieve\u201d leadership framework, which details clear behaviors that we expect from our people leaders to ensure they align with our culture. We have also strengthened our succession planning through a holistic approach to developing key managers that includes challenging assignments, formal development plans and professional coaching. \u200bTraining and Development\u200bOur global human capital management platform enables rigorous identification, analysis and development of talent around the world. In conjunction with that platform, the company utilizes an approach to performance management focused on development and continuous improvement. This approach emphasizes ongoing performance conversations between managers and employees and a focus on mitigating bias in performance conversations, resulting in an enhanced employee developmental experience and data points for our talent discussions. Additionally, all employees have access to create a personal development plan and we have resources to support employees in their personal and professional development, including:\u200b\u25cfContinuous education through various tuition reimbursement programs, apprenticeship and instructional programs;\u25cfA learning management platform that has had significant employee utilization;\u25cfMonthly global leadership panel discussions and breakout groups focused on real-time topics, such as supporting team wellbeing, working through stressful times, setting individual development goals, maximizing team performance, sharing practical steps to better enable our collective focus on D&I and sharing other best practice leadership behaviors;\u25cfA new LinkedIn Learning platform for all corporate and packaging employees who work in an office setting;\u25cfLeadership and personal development coaching opportunities by teaming with BetterUp;\u25cfOn-going education for people leaders around our Inspire, Connect, and Achieve leadership behaviors; and\u25cfAnnual compliance, antitrust, bribery, corruption and business code of conduct and ethics training for key management level, sales and supply chain employees. progress on D&I, which has been recognized by external organizations, including Forbes, which recognized Ball among \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity\u201d in 2019, the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), which recognized Ball as a best place to work for disability inclusion on the 2022 Disability Equality Index, and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which listed Ball among the \u201cBest Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality\u201d in five out of the last six years, including a perfect score on its Corporate Equality Index list in 2021 and 2022. Our dedicated D&I function reports directly to our Chief Human Resources Officer, and we understand that the key to success is shared accountability rather than designating a single owner for this critical area. Our focus to date has been on providing unconscious bias training for our global workforce, continuing to expand our Ball Network and Interest Groups (BNIs) in terms of quantity and geography and increasing awareness about the importance of D&I and each employee\u2019s role in ensuring that we have a culture where people can bring their authentic selves to work and thrive.

Ball shipped approximately 52 billion aluminum beverage containers in North and Central America in 2022, which represented approximately 37\u00a0percent of the aggregate shipments in these countries. Historically, sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend to be highest during the period from April\u00a0through September. All of the beverage containers produced by Ball in the U.S., Canada and Mexico are made of aluminum. In North and Central America, a diverse base of no fewer than ten global suppliers provide almost all of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements.\u200bBeverage containers are sold based on price, quality, service, innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market, which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably.

Our EMEA region operations include 17 facilities throughout Europe and one facility each in Cairo, Egypt, and Manisa, Turkey. In the third quarter of 2022, Ball completed the sale of its aluminum beverage packaging business located in Russia, which included three aluminum beverage can manufacturing facilities. For the countries in which we currently operate, not including Russia, the beverage container market is approximately 90\u00a0billion containers, and we are the largest producer with an estimated 39\u00a0percent of shipments in this region. The regions served by our beverage packaging, EMEA, segment, including Egypt and Turkey, are highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix. Four companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in EMEA. Our EMEA beverage facilities, not including Russia, shipped 35\u00a0billion beverage containers in 2022, all of which were made from aluminum. The company has announced plans to construct additional plants in Pilsen, Czech Republic, and Northamptonshire, U.K. Both facilities are expected to begin production in the first half of 2023. \u200bHistorically, sales volumes of metal beverage containers in EMEA tend to be highest during the period from May\u00a0through August,\u00a0with a\u00a0smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the U.K. Much like in other parts of the world, the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the beer and carbonated soft drink industries.

Our operations consist of 12 facilities\u20149 in Brazil and one each in Argentina, Chile and Paraguay. In the third quarter, Ball permanently ceased operations at its aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility in Santa Cruz, Brazil, and temporarily reduced production across its remaining Brazilian beverage can manufacturing footprint. For the countries where we operate, the South American beverage container market is approximately 40\u00a0billion containers, and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 46\u00a0percent of South American shipments in 2022. Four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the aluminum beverage containers in Brazil. \u200bThe company\u2019s South American beverage facilities shipped approximately 19\u00a0billion aluminum beverage containers in 2022. Historically, sales volumes of beverage containers in South America tend to be highest during the period from September through December. In South America, two suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum can and end sheet requirements with certain requirements also being imported from Asia.\u200bWe limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.\u200bAerospace Segment \u200bBall\u2019s aerospace segment, which accounted for 13\u00a0percent of consolidated net sales in 2022, includes national defense hardware, antenna and video tactical solutions, civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services. The segment develops spacecraft, sensors and instruments, radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil, commercial and national security aerospace markets. The majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other U.S. government agencies. The company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts. Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2022.\u200bIntense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company\u2019s business and the aerospace and defense industry. It is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor, become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa.\u200bGeopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace segment\u2019s core capabilities in space hardware. The businesses include hardware and services sold primarily to U.S. customers, with emphasis on space science and exploration, climate monitoring, weather prediction, environmental and earth sciences, and defense and intelligence applications. Major activities frequently involve the design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software, as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations. \u200bOther hardware activities include target identification, warning and attitude control systems and components; cryogenic systems for reactant storage, and associated sensor cooling devices; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors. \u200b10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Beverage Packaging, South America, Segment\u200bThe beverage packaging, South America, segment accounted for 14 percent of Ball\u2019s consolidated net sales in 2022. Our operations consist of 12 facilities\u20149 in Brazil and one each in Argentina, Chile and Paraguay. In the third quarter, Ball permanently ceased operations at its aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility in Santa Cruz, Brazil, and temporarily reduced production across its remaining Brazilian beverage can manufacturing footprint. For the countries where we operate, the South American beverage container market is approximately 40\u00a0billion containers, and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 46\u00a0percent of South American shipments in 2022. Four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the aluminum beverage containers in Brazil. \u200bThe company\u2019s South American beverage facilities shipped approximately 19\u00a0billion aluminum beverage containers in 2022. Historically, sales volumes of beverage containers in South America tend to be highest during the period from September through December. In South America, two suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum can and end sheet requirements with certain requirements also being imported from Asia.\u200bWe limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.\u200bAerospace Segment \u200bBall\u2019s aerospace segment, which accounted for 13\u00a0percent of consolidated net sales in 2022, includes national defense hardware, antenna and video tactical solutions, civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services. The segment develops spacecraft, sensors and instruments, radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil, commercial and national security aerospace markets. The majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other U.S. government agencies. The company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts. Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2022.\u200bIntense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company\u2019s business and the aerospace and defense industry.
