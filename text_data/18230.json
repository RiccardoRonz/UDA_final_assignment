{"cik": 18230, "item_1A": "Item 1.Business.   General \u00a0 Originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware.\u00a0 As used herein, the term \u201cCaterpillar,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cthe company\u201d refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise. \u00a0 Overview \u00a0 With 2022 sales and revenues of $59.427 billion, Caterpillar is the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.\u00a0 The company principally operates through its three primary segments - Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation - and also provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment.  Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter.\u00a0 Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world. \u00a0 Enterprise Strategy   Our company strategy, rolled out in 2017, reflects our legacy and our continuing commitment to meet the needs of our customers and the communities in which we live and work. United by our Values, Caterpillar employees around the world share a focused view of our business through the Operating & Execution Model, through which we are making strategic choices today to create long-term profitable growth. Since 2017, we focused on three strategic areas: Expanded Offerings, Operational Excellence and Services. In 2022, we updated our strategy to also include sustainability as a strategic focus area. For nearly 100 years, our longstanding commitment to sustainability has inspired us to set and achieve meaningful environmental, social and governance goals. It\u2019s also allowed us to develop innovative products, technologies and services to support our customers on their sustainability journey. The addition of sustainability as a focus area, together with operational excellence, expanded offerings and services, highlights our work to help customers build a better, more sustainable world.  Currently, we have five operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below.\u00a0 \u00a0 Categories of Business Organization \u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Machinery, Energy & Transportation \u2014  Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding Financial Products.

Transportation \u00a0 Our Energy & Transportation segment supports customers in oil and gas, power generation, marine, rail and industrial applications, including Caterpillar machines. The product and services portfolio includes reciprocating engines, generator sets, integrated systems and solutions, turbines and turbine-related services, electrified powertrain and zero-emission power sources and service solutions development, the remanufacturing of Caterpillar engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies, diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services and product support of on-highway vocational trucks for North America.    Regulatory emissions standards require us to continue to make investments as new products and new regulations are introduced.\u00a0 Ongoing compliance with these regulations remains a focus.\u00a0 Emissions compliance in developing markets is complex due to rapidly evolving and unique requirements where enforcement processes can often vary.\u00a0 We employ robust product development, manufacturing processes and testing to help us comply with these regulations.\u00a0  \u00a0 The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, oil and gas, industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines in oil and gas and electric power generation consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application.  Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Deutz AG, INNIO Jenbacher GmbH, Rolls-Royce Power Systems and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Corp.  Other competitors, such as Fiat Industrial SpA (Iveco Group), GE Power, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Energy Solutions & Marine Engineering, MAN Energy Solutions (VW), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Siemens Energy Global GmbH,Volvo Penta AB, Weichai Power Co., Ltd., and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Aggreko plc, Baker Hughes Co., Generac Holdings, Kohler Power Systems, and others, are primarily packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels.  In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include Alstom SA, CRRC Corp., LTD., The Greenbrier Companies, Siemens Mobility, Voestalpine AG, Vossloh AG and Wabtec Freight.  We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions.  The Energy & Transportation portfolio includes the following products and related parts:  \u2022Reciprocating engine powered generator sets \u2022Reciprocating engines, drivetrain and integrated systems and solutions supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery \u2022Integrated systems and solutions used in the electric power generation industry \u2022Turbines, centrifugal gas compressors and related services \u2022Reciprocating engines, drivetrain and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and oil and gas industries \u2022Remanufactured reciprocating engines and components \u2022Diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services  Financial Products Segment \u00a0 The business of our Financial Products Segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, Insurance Services and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates.\u00a0 Cat Financial is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. and it provides retail and wholesale financing to customers and dealers around the world for Caterpillar products and services, as well as financing for vehicles and power generation facilities that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products.  Retail financing is primarily comprised of installment sale contracts and other equipment-related loans, working capital loans, finance leases and operating leases. Wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers consists primarily of inventory and rental fleet financing.  In addition, Cat Financial purchases short-term wholesale trade receivables from Caterpillar. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are designed to support sales of Caterpillar products and services and generate financing income for Cat Financial.\u00a0\u00a0A significant portion of our activity is conducted in North America and we have additional offices and subsidiaries in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Africa.\u00a0\u00a0  For over 40 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing for Caterpillar products, contributing to our knowledge of asset values, industry trends, financing structures and customer needs. \u00a0 3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents In certain instances, Cat Financial\u2019s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i)\u00a0regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii)\u00a0establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii)\u00a0require disclosures to customers, (iv)\u00a0govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi)\u00a0regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower\u2019s credit experience.\u00a0 Cat Financial\u2019s ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations.  Cat Financial\u2019s retail loans include: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing.  \u2022Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with structured payments over time.  Cat Financial's retail leases include: \u00a0 \u2022Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term.  \u2022Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease.\u00a0\u00a0For tax purposes, we are considered the owner of the equipment.  Cat Financial also purchases short-term receivables from Caterpillar. \u00a0 Cat Financial\u2019s wholesale loans and leases include inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets.  Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment and services available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.\u00a0\u00a0Our competitors include Wells Fargo  Equipment Finance Inc., Banc of America Leasing & Capital LLC, BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions Limited, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale S.A. and various other banks and finance companies.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, many of the manufacturers that compete with Caterpillar also own financial subsidiaries, such as John Deere Capital Corporation, Komatsu Financial L.P., Volvo Financial Services and Kubota Credit Corporation, which utilize many below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to support machine sales.\u00a0\u00a0Cat Financial works with the broader Caterpillar organization to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs to compete around the world.  The financial results of Cat Financial are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers\u2019 willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements.\u00a0 Cat Financial is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, its cost of funds relative to its competitors and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates. \u00a0 Cat Financial has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis.\u00a0 In connection with that policy, Cat Financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.  For more information regarding match funding, please see Note\u00a04 \u2014 \u201cDerivative financial instruments and risk management\u201d of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\u00a0 See also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in Item 1 A. of this Form 10-K.   In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financial\u2019s operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\u00a0 This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the assets and liabilities, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. \u00a0 4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics.  Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment.\u00a0 Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers\u2019 sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world.\u00a0 Cat Financial\u2019s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers.\u00a0 Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing.\u00a0 We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products. \u00a0 Caterpillar Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc., is a U.S. insurance company domiciled in Missouri and primarily regulated by the Missouri Department of Insurance.\u00a0 Caterpillar Insurance Company is licensed to conduct property and casualty insurance business in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, and as such, is also regulated in those jurisdictions.\u00a0 The State of Missouri acts as the lead regulatory authority and monitors Caterpillar Insurance Company\u2019s financial status to ensure that it is in compliance with minimum solvency requirements, as well as other financial ratios prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\u00a0 Caterpillar Insurance Company is also licensed to conduct insurance business through a branch in Zurich, Switzerland and, as such, is regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. \u00a0 Caterpillar Life Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar, is a U.S. insurance company domiciled in Missouri and primarily regulated by the Missouri Department of Insurance.\u00a0 Caterpillar Life Insurance Company is licensed to conduct life and accident and health insurance business in 26 states and the District of Columbia and, as such, is also regulated in those jurisdictions.

Competitive Environment \u00a0 Caterpillar products and services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets.\u00a0 In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price.\u00a0 From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region.\u00a0 Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions. \u00a0 Raw Materials and Component Products \u00a0 We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts.\u00a0 Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications.\u00a0 We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes.\u00a0 We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities\u2019 production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend.\u00a0 We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products.\u00a0However, in some cases, increases in demand or supply chain disruptions have led to parts and components constraints across some products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption.\u00a0 The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery. \u00a0 Patents and Trademarks \u00a0 We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business. We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.   Order Backlog \u00a0 The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $30.4 billion at December\u00a031, 2022 and $23.1 billion at December\u00a031, 2021. Compared with year-end 2021, the order backlog increased for both the Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries segments, with the largest increase in Energy & Transportation. Of the total backlog at December\u00a031, 2022, approximately $5.5 billion was not expected to be filled in 2023.\u00a0  Dealers and Distributors \u00a0 We distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 43 located in the United States and 113 located outside the United States, serving 192 countries.\u00a0\u00a0We sell reciprocating engines principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. We also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide network of 88 distributors covering 185 countries.  We sell the FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems through its worldwide network of 110 distributors covering 109 countries.\u00a0\u00a0We also sell some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.\u00a0 \u00a0 6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers\u2019 principal business.\u00a0 We sell some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company.\u00a0 At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.    While the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated, we own and operate a dealership in Japan that covers approximately 80% of the Japanese market:  Nippon Caterpillar Division.  We are currently operating this Japanese dealer directly and we report its results in the All Other operating segment.  There are also three independent dealers in the Southern Region of Japan. \u00a0 For Caterpillar branded products, the company\u2019s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements.\u00a0 Pursuant to these agreements, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory.\u00a0 The company establishes prices to dealers after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace.\u00a0 The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer.\u00a0 The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the company\u2019s trademarks, service marks and brand names.\u00a0 In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer. \u00a0 In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company\u2019s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer\u2019s service territory.\u00a0 Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the company\u2019s products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the company\u2019s product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company\u2019s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer\u2019s financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company\u2019s reasonable request. \u00a0 These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice. \u00a0 Human Capital  Core Values  Caterpillar\u2019s global workforce is united by Our Values In Action, Caterpillar\u2019s Code of Conduct. Integrity, Excellence, Teamwork, Commitment and Sustainability provide the foundation for our values-based culture. Our diversity and inclusion principles are embedded in our values. Our values unite us, and reflect our diverse cultures, languages, geographies, and businesses, as one Caterpillar team.  Health and Safety  The health and safety of our employees is an important focus at Caterpillar, and we strive to continually reduce our recordable injuries. As part of this focus on health and safety, Caterpillar has established a peer-to-peer safety mentorship and education program for manufacturing new hires to accelerate acclimation to our safety culture in many global locations. In 2022, the Company achieved a recordable injury frequency rate of 0.44, compared to the 2021 recordable injury frequency rate of 0.41.   Talent Development and Training  In addition to our focus on values and safety, we strive to continually attract, develop, engage, and retain a high-performing diverse global team that executes our enterprise strategy of long-term profitable growth.  We are committed to employee development and helping individuals reach their full potential, by making on-going investments in our team. Our global internships, engineering co-ops, and career programs for engineering, marketing, and manufacturing provide development opportunities for early career employees. We also have a continual focus on strengthening technical, professional and leadership capabilities at every level. Strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur at a minimum, annually, across our businesses.  Our leadership development programs and focus on encouraging a variety of experiences to help employees broaden understanding and increase perspective. Our leadership curriculums include managing for inclusion as a core development principle and a professional skill.   7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Additionally, skill-based programs to upskill our manufacturing employees are developed locally and tailored to the specific needs of the business. In China, we continue to invest in programs that encourage women to pursue engineering management and leadership roles. In India, we tailored recruiting campaigns and on-site benefits to attract female employees. Caterpillar, along with other companies across industries, participates in the OneTen coalition. The coalition is committed to upskill, hire and advance Black Americans over the next 10 years into family-sustaining careers.  Diversity and Inclusion  We are committed to fostering a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment. Our strategic approach weaves diversity and inclusion seamlessly into the business, ensuring that the principles guide us in our daily operating rhythm. Our 14 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are sponsored and supported by leadership, help ensure different voices and perspectives contribute to our strategy for long-term profitable growth. They also engage our employees, helping contribute to development and retention.   Our ERGs provide many contributions, such as mentoring programs that connect diverse employees with senior leaders who can support their career goals, partnerships with recruiters and diverse early career and professional organizations that can assist in strengthening the diverse talent pipeline and programs that educate and inform on the richness of the global cultures that we share.   Compensation, Benefits and Employee Insights  Providing competitive benefits and compensation underpins our commitment to our engaged and productive employees. Our pay-for-performance philosophy aligns employee\u2019s individual contributions, behaviors and business results with individual rewards. Our comprehensive Total Health programs focus on purpose, as well as physical, emotional, financial, and social health. The annual Employee Insights Survey provides all employees the opportunity to confidentially share their perspectives and engages leaders to listen, learn and respond to employee feedback.  Employment  Management aligns employment levels with the needs of the business. We believe we have the appropriate human capital resources to successfully operate and deliver our enterprise strategy. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we employed about 109,100 full-time persons of whom approximately 60,900 were located outside the United States.  In the United States, we employed approximately 48,200 full-time persons, most of whom are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement.\u00a0 At select business units, we have hired certain highly specialized employees under employment contracts that specify a term of employment, pay and other benefits. \u00a0Full-Time\u00a0Employees\u00a0at\u00a0Year-End\u00a020222021Inside U.S.48,20044,300Outside U.S.60,90063,400Total109,100107,700By Region:\u00a0\u00a0North America48,70044,700EAME16,90017,600Latin America19,10019,500Asia/Pacific24,40025,900Total109,100107,700  As of December\u00a031, 2022, there were approximately 7,980 hourly production employees in the United States who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, including The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), The International Association of Machinists and The United Steelworkers. Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements generally correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u00a0   Environmental Matters \u00a0 The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. \u00a0 We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws.\u00a0 When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs of the remedial action are accrued against our earnings.\u00a0 Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience.  Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum.  Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs.  In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others.\u00a0 We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis.  The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item \"Accrued expenses\" in Statement 3 \u2014 \"Consolidated Financial Position at December 31\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"  There is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.
