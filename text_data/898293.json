Business The Company We are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. Our services enable our customers to reduce manufacturing costs, improve supply-chain management, reduce inventory obsolescence, lower transportation costs and reduce product fulfillment time. Our manufacturing and supply chain management services and solutions include innovation, design, planning, fabrication and assembly, delivery and managing the flow of resources and products. We serve our customers primarily through dedicated business units that combine highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing with advanced electronic design and design for manufacturability. We conduct our operations in facilities that are located worldwide, including but not limited to China, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and the United States. Our global manufacturing production sites allow customers to manufacture products simultaneously in the optimal locations for their products. Our global presence is key to assessing and executing on our business opportunities. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, we had net revenues of $34.7 billion and net income attributable to Jabil Inc. of $818 million. We have two reporting segments: Electronics Manufacturing Services (\u201cEMS\u201d) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (\u201cDMS\u201d), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. Our EMS segment is focused around leveraging IT, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. Our EMS segment is a high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the 5G, wireless and cloud, digital print and retail, industrial and semi-capital equipment, and networking and storage industries. Our DMS segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences, machining, tooling, and molding of highly engineered plastic and metal parts.

Additional financial information regarding our reportable operating segments is included in Item\u00a07 of this report and Note 13 \u2013 \u201cConcentration of Risk and Segment Data\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry Background The industry in which we operate has historically been composed of companies that provide a range of design and manufacturing services to companies that utilize electronics components in their products. In recent years, the industry has expanded to include customers that require products and services beyond electronic components including plastics and metal components, packaging, and injection molding. We monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances change. Over the long term we believe the factors driving our customers and potential customers to use our industry\u2019s services include: \u00a0 \u2022Efficient Manufacturing. Manufacturing service providers are often able to manufacture products at a reduced total cost to companies. These cost advantages result from higher utilization of capacity and efficiencies of scale because of diversified product demand and, generally, a greater focus on the components of manufacturing cost. Companies are increasingly seeking to reduce their investment in inventory, facilities and equipment used in manufacturing and prioritizing capital investments in other activities such as sales and marketing and research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d). This strategic shift in capital deployment has contributed to increased demand for and interest in outsourcing to external manufacturing service providers.  \u2022Accelerated Product Time-to-Market and Time-to-Volume. Manufacturing service providers are often able to deliver accelerated production start-ups and achieve high efficiencies in bringing new products to production. Providers are also able to more rapidly scale production for changing markets and to position themselves in global locations that serve the leading world markets. With increasingly shorter product life cycles, these key services allow new products to be sold in the marketplace in an accelerated time frame.  \u2022Access to Advanced Design and Manufacturing Technologies. By utilizing manufacturing service providers, customers gain access to additional advanced technologies in manufacturing processes, as well as to product and  2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents production design, which can offer customers significant improvements in the performance, quality, cost, time-to-market and manufacturability of their products.  \u2022Improved Inventory Management and Purchasing Power. Manufacturing service providers are often able to more efficiently manage both procurement and inventory, and have demonstrated proficiency in purchasing components at improved pricing due to the scale of their operations and continuous interaction with the materials marketplace. Our Strategy Our vision for the future is to become the world\u2019s most technologically advanced manufacturing services and solutions provider. As we work to achieve our vision, we continue to pursue the following strategies: \u00a0 \u2022Establish and Maintain Long-Term Customer Relationships. An important element of our strategy is to establish and maintain long-term relationships with leading companies in expanding industries with size and growth characteristics that can benefit from highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing on a global scale. We focus on maintaining long-term relationships with our customers and seek to expand these relationships to include additional product lines and services. In addition, we focus on identifying and developing relationships with new customers that meet our targeted profile, which includes financial stability, the need for technology-driven turnkey manufacturing, anticipated unit volume and long-term relationship stability.  \u2022Product Diversification. We focus on balancing our portfolio of products and product families to those that align with higher return areas of our business, including manufacturing, supply chain management services, comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services, 5G wireless, cloud, healthcare, packaging, automotive and transportation, and semi-capital equipment. We have made concentrated efforts to diversify our industry sectors and customer base. Because of these efforts, we have experienced business growth from both existing and new customers as well as from acquisitions.   \u2022Utilize Customer-Centric Business Units. Most of our business units are dedicated to serve one customer each and operate by primarily utilizing dedicated production equipment, production workers, supervisors, buyers, planners and engineers to provide comprehensive manufacturing solutions that are customized to each customer\u2019s needs. We believe our customer-centric business units promote increased responsiveness to our customers\u2019 needs, particularly for customer relationships that extend across multiple production locations.  \u2022Leverage Global Production. We believe that global production is a key strategy to reduce obsolescence risk and secure the lowest possible landed costs while simultaneously supplying products of equivalent or comparable quality throughout the world. Consistent with this strategy, we have established or acquired operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our extensive global footprint positions us well to implement safe and practical solutions in order to select production locations which best serve the needs of our customers. We believe that our global footprint is strengthened by our centralized procurement process, which when coupled with our single Enterprise Resource Planning system affords our customers with end-to-end supply chain visibility.  \u2022Offer Systems Assembly, Direct-Order Fulfillment and Configure-to-Order Services. Our systems assembly, direct-order fulfillment and configure-to-order services allow our customers to reduce product cost and risk of product obsolescence by reducing total work-in-process and finished goods inventory. These services are available at all of our manufacturing locations.  \u2022Offer Design Services. We offer a wide spectrum of value-add design services to achieve improvements in performance, cost, time-to-market and manufacturability.  \u2022Pursue Acquisition Opportunities Selectively. The primary goals of our acquisition strategy are to complement our current capabilities, diversify our business into new industry sectors and with new customers and expand the scope of the services we can offer to our customers. Our Approach to Manufacturing To achieve high levels of manufacturing performance, we have adopted the following approaches: \u00a0 \u2022Decentralized Business Unit Model. Most of our business units are dedicated to serve one customer each and are empowered to formulate strategies tailored to individual customer\u2019s needs. Our business units generally have dedicated production lines consisting of equipment, production workers, supervisors, buyers, planners and engineers. Under certain circumstances, a production line may serve more than one business unit to maximize resource utilization.  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents Business units have direct responsibility for manufacturing results and time-to-volume production, thereby promoting a sense of individual commitment and ownership. The business unit approach is modular and enables us to grow incrementally without disrupting the operations of other business units. Business unit management reviews the customer financial information to assess whether the business units are meeting their designated responsibilities and to ensure that the daily execution of manufacturing activities is being effectively managed. The business units aggregate into operating segments based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market share strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles.  \u2022Automated Continuous Flow. We use a highly automated, continuous flow approach to manufacturing, whereby different pieces of equipment are joined directly or by conveyor to create an in-line assembly process. This process contrasts with a batch approach, whereby individual pieces of assembly equipment are operated as freestanding work-centers. The elimination of waiting time prior to sequential operations results in faster manufacturing, which improves production efficiencies and quality control, and reduces inventory work-in-process. We believe continuous flow manufacturing provides cost reductions and quality improvement when applied to high volumes of product.  \u2022Computerized Control and Monitoring. We support all aspects of our manufacturing activities with advanced computerized control and monitoring systems. Component inspection and vendor quality are monitored electronically in real-time. Materials planning, purchasing, stockroom and shop floor control systems are supported through a computerized manufacturing resource planning system, which provides customers with the ability to continuously monitor material availability and track work-in-process on a real-time basis. In addition, manufacturing processes are supported by a computerized statistical process control system, whereby customers can remotely access our computer systems to monitor real-time yields, inventory positions, work-in-process status and vendor quality data.  \u2022Electronic Supply Chain Management. We make available to our customers and suppliers an electronic commerce system/electronic data interchange and web-based tools to implement a variety of supply chain management programs. Our customers use these tools to share demand and product forecasts and deliver purchase orders, and we use these tools with our suppliers for just-in-time delivery, supplier-managed inventory and consigned supplier-managed inventory. Our Design Services We offer a wide spectrum of value-add design services to enhance our relationships with current customers and to help develop relationships with our new customers. Our teams are strategically staffed to support Jabil customers for all development projects, including turnkey system design and design for manufacturing activities.

Customers and Marketing A key tenet of our strategy is to establish and maintain long-term relationships with leading companies in expanding industries with the size and growth characteristics that can benefit from highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing on a global scale. A small number of customers and significant industry sectors have historically comprised a major portion of our net revenue. We also market our services and solutions through our website and our Blue Sky Innovation Centers. In fiscal year 2023, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 42% of our net revenue and 84 customers accounted for approximately 90% of our net revenue. The table below sets forth the respective portion of net revenue attributable to the customer that accounted for a significant concentration of our net revenue during the periods indicated: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFiscal\u00a0Year\u00a0Ended\u00a0August\u00a031,\n\n\u00a0\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\nApple, Inc.\n17\u00a0\n%\n\n19\u00a0\n%\n\n22\u00a0\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Apple, Inc. Competition Our business is highly competitive. We compete against numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturing service providers, diversified manufacturing service providers and design providers. We also face competition from the manufacturing  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents operations of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. We compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity takes place. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the manufacturing services market are: cost; accelerated production time-to-market; higher efficiencies; global locations; rapid scale production; advanced technologies; quality; and improved pricing of components. We believe we are extremely competitive with regard to all of these factors. Components Procurement We procure components from a broad group of suppliers, determined on an assembly-by-assembly basis. Our global sourcing and purchasing locations are strategically placed in various countries throughout the world along with our global commodity management and supplier relationship teams. These locations manage our end-to-end procurement lifecycle. This regionalized expertise along with our supplier relationships provide efficient procurement operations. Some of the products we manufacture contain one or more components that are only available from a single source. Some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages. In some cases, supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component. Proprietary Rights We regard certain aspects of our technology, design, production and product management services as proprietary intellectual property. To protect our trade secrets, manufacturing know-how and other proprietary rights, we rely largely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements with our customers, employees, and suppliers and our internal security systems, policies and procedures. We currently have a relatively modest number of patents for various innovations. We believe that\u00a0our research and design activities, along with developments\u00a0relating thereto, may result in growth\u00a0of our patent portfolio and its importance to us, particularly as we expand our business activities. Other\u00a0factors significant to our proprietary rights include the knowledge and experience of\u00a0our management and workforce and our ability to develop, enhance and market our technology and services. We license some technology and intellectual property rights from third parties. Generally, the license agreements that govern such third-party technology and intellectual property rights grant us the right to use the subject technology anywhere in the world and terminate upon a material breach by us. Human Capital Management As of August 31, 2023, our workforce includes diverse, talented and dedicated employees across approximately 100 locations in more than 30 countries who differentiate us from our competitors. To maintain our edge, we continually invest in our employees, so that they can take care of our customers, shareholders and communities. Following is a summary of employees by location (in thousands): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion\n\nNumber of Employees\n\nAsia\n\n167\n\nAmericas\n\n52\n\nEurope\n\n17\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total(1)\n\n236\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total(1) (1)Total headcount includes permanent, temporary and contingent workers. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by works councils. We have not experienced a significant work stoppage or strike and promote positive employee relations. Safety  \u201cSafety First\u201d is a fundamental value that is ingrained in our culture. We are committed to safety standards in all of our facilities, ensuring our employees are protected and can return home safely after each work shift. By implementing a continuous improvement-based Health and Safety Management System including annual training assessments coupled with engaged leaders and employees who prioritize safety above all else, we have established a path to safety excellence.  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Human Rights We promote respect for fundamental human rights as an essential element of responsible corporate citizenship. We are a founding member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), which is one of the world\u2019s largest industry coalitions for corporate social responsibility in global supply chains. The RBA sets (1) standards regarding excessive working hours and unfair wages, (2) controls to prohibit child labor and human trafficking, and (3) avenues for employees to raise and address workplace health and safety concerns. We have aligned our work programs, processes and procedures to the RBA Code of Conduct to help ensure working conditions are safe, employees are treated with respect and dignity and manufacturing process and practices are environmentally responsible. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion At Jabil, our core strength lies in our diverse workforce, providing us with the innovation and creativity that have allowed us to continue our success. Welcoming a spectrum of backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints, we collaborate effectively to create an environment where every employee feels physically and psychologically safe to bring their true selves to work every day. Our approach not only empowers our employees to embrace authenticity, but also challenges, and uplifts them, enabling them to create an impact both within their roles and the global space.  In keeping with our Code of Conduct, we are dedicated to establishing a discrimination-free and harassment-free environment globally, helping to ensure the human rights of all our employees are respected. Guided by our enterprise-wide priorities of mitigating biases, cultivating inclusive leadership, and developing diverse talent, we are proud to foster a culture of belonging. In fiscal year 2023, we further advanced diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programming through the formation of our second enterprise-wide DEI Council, which works closely with our business, manufacturing, and functional teams to identify areas of focus and make informed decisions around our DEI strategy and organization. This second global council is committed to building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment. During fiscal year 2023, numerous initiatives were launched in alignment with Jabil\u2019s ESG goals to increase the representation of women in leadership and programming around disability inclusion. We launched our first wave of global events focused on women, creating the opportunity for women leaders across our functional teams, to share their experiences and advice in an open forum setting. While geared toward women, all employees at all levels at Jabil were welcome to participate in these seven engaging sessions to enhance both professional and personal development. We also hosted regionalized training in our Latin America sites related to biases, discrimination, and harassment against women. We were proud to receive a top score on the 2023 Disability Equality Index by Disability:IN for the third consecutive year. Sites globally developed and implemented programs focused on employment and retention of employees with disabilities, physical and digital infrastructure, and training programs to foster an inclusive environment. With support from Disability:IN, we created and implemented a new learning, \u201cDisability Inclusion & Awareness in the Workplace,\u201d complete with best practices and an introduction in sign language by our team in Dominican Republic. Beyond these two focus areas, we completed many initiatives at the site level to celebrate diversity across the Americas, Europe, and Asia, including sponsoring and walking in Pride Parades, external social media and communication campaigns, training sessions to mitigate unconscious bias, and more. Compensation and Benefits Jabil\u2019s compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with Jabil\u2019s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. Specifically: \u2022We provide employee pay levels that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. \u2022Salary increases and incentive compensation are based on merit and performance. \u2022All full-time U.S. employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan and life and disability/accident coverage. Benefits outside the U.S. are provided based upon country-specific practices and are intended to support the health and well-being of our employees and their families. \u2022Supporting the mental health and emotional well-being of our employees and their families is a high priority at Jabil, and we have implemented several programs and benefits over the past several years to help de-stigmatize mental health issues and assist employees in finding and leveraging appropriate resources. These include a global employee assistance program (EAP), on-site behavioral health resources in some locations and education for our leaders on ways to recognize and respond to signs of mental health and substance abuse issues. By focusing on training leaders in mental health awareness, we are creating the right environment for mental health issues to be recognized and addressed. Additionally, our Health and Wellbeing programs help to strengthen mental health resilience. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022The majority of our employees around the world are eligible to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase plan, allowing them to become owners of Jabil stock at a discount. Career Growth and Development At Jabil, we have historically invested in the professional and personal growth and development of our employees at all levels of the organization to encourage continuous learning and skills enrichment. In addition, we undertake talent reviews to assess bench strength and succession planning. During these reviews, we also spotlight high potential talent, retention rates and the diversity composition of our leaders. In fiscal year 2023, there were more than 19,000 internal promotions at various levels in Jabil, a testament to our ability to grow and develop our own talent. Employee Engagement In May 2023, we conducted our global Voice of the Employee Survey, administered by a third party. Action plans have been developed and are in the process of being executed at all sites to promote continued excellence in employee engagement at Jabil. This is a continuation of four Voice of the Employee Pulse Surveys conducted in 2022 to measure the impact of action plans developed from the 2021 global survey. Cultural Initiatives Our commitment to our employees\u2019 safety and wellbeing goes beyond physical health to include social, emotional and mental health. At Jabil, we provide our employees two days of paid time off for health & wellbeing and one day for community service. As of August 31, 2023, almost 95,000 employees have utilized their wellness days, and over 13,000 employees have completed a paid day of community service.  To support our commitment to serve our communities where we live and operate, Jabil employees completed over 1 million volunteer hours in 2022. From January to July 2023, Jabil employees and sites have volunteered approximately 500,000 service hours in their local communities to help make a difference in the areas of education, empowerment and the environment. We believe that while our efforts are locally driven, the impact is global. Jabil hosted four \u201cGlobal Volunteer Days,\u201d large scale volunteer events designed to create shared experiences across the organization around a particular cause. The four Global Volunteer Days held in 2023 were International Women\u2019s Day, Earth Day, World Environment Day, and World Food Day. In 2023, Jabil hosted employees from around the globe for our annual continuous improvement competition, Deliver Best Practices. This week-long celebration embodies the best of Jabil\u2019s culture by encouraging individuals to learn more about one another while also competing to be named the top project around four key business drivers (People, Process, Social & Environmental and Technology & Innovation). Environmental We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process, those governing worker health and safety, those requiring design changes, supply chain investigation or conformity assessments or those relating to the recycling or reuse of products we manufacture.  Information about our Executive Officers Executive officers are appointed by the Board of Directors and serve at the discretion of the Board. There are no family relationships among our executive officers and directors.
