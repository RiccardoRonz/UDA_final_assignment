{"cik": 1341439, "item_1A": "Item 1.\tBusiness Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments), such as Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region offerings (instances of Oracle Cloud in a customer\u2019s own data center) and multicloud options that enable customers to use Oracle Cloud in conjunction with other public clouds. Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers\u2019 needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build, deploy, run, manage and support their internal and external products, services and business operations, including, for example, a global cloud applications developer that utilizes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to power its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings; a multi-national financial institution that runs its banking applications using Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer; and a global consumer products company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning for its accounting processes, risk management, supply chain and financial planning functions. Oracle SaaS and OCI (collectively Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services delivered via various cloud delivery models enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Oracle Cloud Services integrate the IT components, including software, hardware and services, on a customer\u2019s behalf in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for the customer and that a customer may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices.  Oracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interoperability and extensibility to easily move workloads among the Oracle Cloud and other IT and cloud environments; cost-effective by lowering upfront customer investments and implementing usage-based resource consumption costs; and highly secure, standards-based and reliable.  Oracle cloud license and on-premise license deployment offerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.  Oracle hardware products include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products. Oracle also offers professional services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle products and services. Providing choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings, more restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer\u2019s transition to cloud-based IT environments. Our investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we invested $8.6 billion, $7.2 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another, including through the use of OCI to power our Oracle Fusion SaaS Applications, which we and our customers use to run internal business processes. We focus our development efforts  3 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements \u00a0 on improving the performance, security, reliability, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings relative to our competitors; facilitating the ease with which organizations are able to deploy, use, manage and maintain our offerings; and incorporating emerging technologies within our offerings to enable leaner business processes, automation and innovation.

Oracle Cloud Operations Oracle Cloud Operations deliver our Oracle Cloud Services to customers through a secure, reliable, scalable, enterprise grade cloud infrastructure platform managed by Oracle employees within a global network of data centers, which we refer to as the Oracle Cloud. The Oracle Cloud enables secure and isolated cloud-based instances for each of our customers to access the functionality of Oracle Cloud Services via a broad spectrum of devices. Oracle Cloud Operations leverage automated software tools to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technology capabilities to the Oracle Cloud as they become available, providing Oracle customers access to the latest Oracle releases generally on a quarterly cadence. We have invested in the expansion of the Oracle Cloud by increasing existing data center capacity and adding additional data centers in new geographic locations to meet current and expected customer demand. We expect this trend will continue.  11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements \u00a0 Manufacturing  We rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce most of our hardware products that we market and sell to customers and utilize internally to deliver Oracle Cloud Services, and we distribute most of our hardware products from these partners\u2019 facilities. Our manufacturing processes are substantially based on standardization of components across product types and centralization of assembly and distribution centers. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of suppliers. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternative sources of supply or such sources are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain hardware components. We monitor and evaluate potential risks of disruption within our supply chain operations. Refer to Risk Factors included in Item 1A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our hardware products and the related risks to our businesses.  Sales and Marketing We directly market and sell our cloud, license, hardware, support and services offerings globally to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies and educational institutions. We also market and sell our offerings globally through indirect channels.  In the United States (U.S.), our sales and services employees are based throughout the country. Outside the U.S., our international subsidiaries sell, support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography-specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings. Our international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this Annual Report. A summary of our domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We also market our product offerings worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network. The Oracle Partner Network is a global program that manages our business relationships with a large, broad-based network of companies, including cloud and license, hardware and services suppliers, system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon and in conjunction with our product offerings. By offering our partners access to our product offerings, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally. Research and Development We develop the substantial majority of our products and services offerings internally utilizing the skills and diversity of a global workforce. In addition, we have extended our products and services offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. However, although we believe that our patents have value, neither our business as a whole nor any of our principal businesses are materially dependent on a single patent. Rapid technological advances in cloud, software and hardware development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current products and services offerings.  12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements \u00a0 Human Capital Resources At Oracle, our success is driven by the quality of our people, who we believe are among the best and brightest in the industry. We strive to attract and retain talented employees, to support employee success and well-being and to foster a culture where everyone has a voice in driving innovation. Our Board of Directors oversees diversity and inclusion (D&I) matters and the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and monitoring matters related to human capital management, including talent acquisition and retention. Workforce As of May 31, 2023, we employed approximately 164,000 full-time employees, of which approximately 62,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 102,000 were employed internationally. Our approximate employee counts by lines of business are: \u00a0 27,000 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cloud services and license support operations \u00a0 \u00a0 39,000 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Services \u00a0 35,000 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sales and marketing \u00a0 \u00a0 47,000 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Research and development \u00a0 3,000 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hardware \u00a0 \u00a0 13,000 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0General and administrative The average tenure of our employees is approximately eight years and 27% of our employees have been employed with Oracle for ten or more years. None of our employees in the U.S. are represented by labor unions; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers\u2019 councils represent some of our employees. Diversity and Inclusion We believe that D&I powers innovation and that the diversity of our workforce is critical to helping our customers solve difficult problems. Our focus on D&I is reflected throughout our organization, starting at the highest level. Our Chief Executive Officer is a woman and forty percent of the members of our Board of Directors are women and/or come from a diverse background. We endeavor to hire employees from a broad pool of talent with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and abilities and we believe Oracle\u2019s leaders serve as role models for our diverse and inclusive workforce. We strive to enable our employees to further their careers, build their networks and foster the skills needed to succeed at Oracle, including through participation in our Employee Resource Groups, which offer employees opportunities to engage in mentor relationships and further develop diverse leaders and employees at Oracle. We seek to continuously build on our inclusive hiring strategies, tracking our progress and holding ourselves accountable for greater diversity at Oracle. Our programs are supported by Oracle leaders across the company with strategic sponsorship from Oracle\u2019s Executive Diversity Council, which is led by Safra Catz, our Chief Executive Officer, and extend through the actions we are taking globally on Oracle\u2019s five D&I Imperatives: \u2022driving insight and accountability with data; driving insight and accountability with data; \u2022recruiting with an intention on diversity; recruiting with an intention on diversity; \u2022embedding inclusion into talent development; embedding inclusion into talent development; \u2022inspiring an inclusive culture through community; and inspiring an inclusive culture through community; and \u2022investing in the future diversity of our industry. investing in the future diversity of our industry. In addition to global, regional and local programs, Oracle Human Resources partners with business leaders to create and implement D&I plans to embed targeted strategies into organizations across Oracle. Employee satisfaction on the importance of D&I at Oracle and their manager\u2019s encouragement of diverse ideas and perspectives ranks high in our employee engagement surveys. We are proud to be recognized for our ongoing progress and commitment to D&I. Examples of recognition received include being named one of the World\u2019s Top Female-Friendly Companies and one of America\u2019s Best Employers For Women by Forbes in 2022 and one of America\u2019s Best Employers For Diversity by Forbes in 2023; a Best Place to Work by the Disability Equality Index in 2022 for the fifth consecutive year; a 2022 Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality  13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements \u00a0 by the Human Rights Campaign; a 2023 5-Star Employer by VETS Indexes; and a 2023 Top Supporter of Historically Black College and University Engineering Schools by Career Communications Group. Employee Experience Oracle strives to deliver a great employee experience, anchored by meaningful work, career opportunities and well-being to continue to attract and retain high quality talent. We support employee well-being from multiple dimensions, including economic, health, development and lifestyle with a comprehensive suite of compensation, benefits and learning and development. Opportunities to Learn and Grow We believe that one of the primary reasons candidates join Oracle is for the opportunity to develop their careers. We have programs and resources to help our employees explore, build and achieve their career goals. We promote regular career conversations between leaders and employees. These are separate from performance feedback conversations and are focused on helping employees identify and take steps to grow their careers. Our Talent Review process, which runs on Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM, provides the mechanism for leaders to review and discuss opportunities and action plans to develop employees. 29% of our open non-entry level positions were filled internally in fiscal 2023, providing growth opportunities and retaining critical knowledge and talent. We believe that helping our employees learn and apply new skills is key to retaining them and critical to our ability to innovate and rapidly evolve. We support employees with easily accessible learning resources to help build skills for today and the future. Oracle employees received more than three million hours of training in fiscal 2023 and accessed online learning content at an average rate of more than two million views per month. Our employees take advantage of online classes and learning resources on business, leadership and technical skills, as well as webinars and learning opportunities that are designed to support employee and family well-being. Leaders Who Listen We believe that an important aspect of creating a culture and environment that supports employee, customer and business success is listening to employee feedback. We share the results of our annual employee engagement survey with leaders who receive direct observations from employees about areas critical to Oracle\u2019s strategic priorities, including the employee and customer experience. The results of the survey are also discussed with our Board of Directors and committees thereof. In fiscal 2023, 81% of our employees participated in the annual survey. Leaders listen to employees, evaluate feedback and prioritize actions to enhance employee, business and customer success. Making a Difference Each year, through our volunteering and giving programs, Oracle employees donate tens of thousands of volunteer hours and millions of dollars (matched by Oracle) to a wide variety of causes. Oracle and our employees also rise to the occasion in times of crisis. During fiscal 2023, through employee donations and Oracle\u2019s matching contributions, we raised more than $1 million for disaster relief and recovery in response to earthquakes in Turkey, hurricanes in the United States and other natural disasters.  Oracle also contributes tens of millions of dollars annually to protect the natural world and wildlife, advance education and strengthen communities. Among our recent commitments is a $1 million multi-year grant to The National Museum of African American History and Culture, a Smithsonian Institution museum located in Washington, D.C. Oracle is committed to being at the forefront of positive social impact through initiatives focused on education, the environment and community. Our philanthropic education initiatives, Oracle Academy and the Oracle Education Foundation, help students develop the skills they need to become technology innovators and leaders. Oracle also hosts Design Tech High School, a public charter school, at our Redwood Shores, California campus. 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements \u00a0 Seasonality and Cyclicality Our quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the IT industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. See \u201cCloud and License Business\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of the revenues, expenses and margins of our cloud and license business, which is our largest business. Competition We face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change. Our customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their IT environments. Our enterprise cloud, license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation, Intel Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Adobe Systems Incorporated, Alphabet Inc., Salesforce, Inc. and SAP SE, as well as other companies like Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. For example, following our acquisition of Cerner, we also face competition from large healthcare IT providers such as Epic Systems Corporation, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Arcadia Solutions, athenahealth, Inc. and InterSystems Corporation, among others. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions\u2014including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures or repositioning of product lines\u2014which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories.  Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of use, speed to production and quality of technical support. Our products and services sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other factors: \u2022market adoption of cloud-based IT offerings, including SaaS and cloud infrastructure offerings;  market adoption of cloud-based IT offerings, including SaaS and cloud infrastructure offerings;  \u2022the ease of deployment, use, transacting for and maintenance of our products and services offerings; the ease of deployment, use, transacting for and maintenance of our products and services offerings; \u2022compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our Oracle Cloud environments; compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our Oracle Cloud environments; \u2022the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; \u2022the broader \u201cplatform\u201d competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft; the broader \u201cplatform\u201d competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft; \u2022operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft\u2019s Windows Server and other UNIX and Linux operating systems; operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft\u2019s Windows Server and other UNIX and Linux operating systems; \u2022the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; \u2022products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff;  products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff;  15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements \u00a0 \u2022products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and \u2022the attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers. the attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.
