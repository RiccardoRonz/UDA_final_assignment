{"cik": 1792044, "item_1A": "ITEM 1.Business About Viatris Viatris is a global healthcare company formed in November 2020 whose mission is to empower people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life, regardless of geography or circumstance. Improving the ability of patients to gain access to sustainable and high-quality healthcare is our relentless pursuit. One that rests on visionary thinking, determination and best-in-class capabilities that were strategically built to remove barriers across the health spectrum and advance access globally. Viatris\u2019 seasoned management team is focused on ensuring that the Company is optimally structured and efficiently resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients, shareholders, customers and other key stakeholders. With a global workforce of approximately 37,000, the Company has industry leading commercial, R&D, regulatory, manufacturing, legal and medical expertise complemented by a strong commitment to quality and an unparalleled geographic footprint to deliver high-quality medicines to patients in more than 165 countries and territories. Viatris\u2019 portfolio comprises more than 1,400 approved molecules across a wide range of key therapeutic areas, including globally recognized iconic and key brands, generics, and complex generics, including biosimilars prior to the Biocon Biologics Transaction. The Company operates approximately 40 manufacturing sites worldwide that produce oral solid doses, injectables, complex dosage forms and APIs. Viatris is headquartered in the U.S., with global centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Shanghai, China and Hyderabad, India. On November 16, 2020, Viatris, formerly known as Upjohn, Mylan and Pfizer consummated the combination of Mylan with the Upjohn Business through a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. As a result of the Combination, Viatris held the combined Upjohn Business and Mylan business and Mylan ceased to exist as a separate legal entity after merging with and into Mylan II B.V., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Viatris. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, Mylan is considered the accounting acquirer of the Upjohn Business and all historical financial information of the Company prior to November 16, 2020 represents Mylan\u2019s historical results and the Company\u2019s thereafter. Refer to Note 4 Acquisitions and Other Transactions included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.   Prior to the separation of the Upjohn Business from the remainder of Pfizer\u2019s businesses, the legacy Upjohn Business historically received support services from Pfizer. In connection with the Separation and Combination, Viatris entered into several agreements with Pfizer or its subsidiaries, including among others, transition services and the manufacturing and supply agreements, which in general provide for the performance of certain services or obligations by each of Pfizer and Viatris for the benefit of each other for initial transitional periods following the Combination. By the end of 2022, the Company had exited substantially all transition services with Pfizer.   In February 2022, the Company announced plans for certain strategic actions, anchored by a significant global reshaping initiative designed to unlock trapped value and provide the financial flexibility required to deliver on its vision. The Company also announced that it had entered into a strategic transaction with Biocon Biologics to create what it expects to be a vertically integrated global biosimilars leader, as well as potential plans to divest other select assets no longer considered core to our future strategy to help reshape the Company.  On February 27, 2022, Viatris entered into a definitive agreement with Biocon Biologics to contribute its biosimilars portfolio to Biocon Biologics. The transaction subsequently closed on November 29, 2022. Under the terms of the Biocon Agreement, Viatris received $3 billion in consideration in the form of a $2 billion cash payment, adjusted as set forth in the Biocon Agreement, and approximately $1 billion of CCPS representing a stake of approximately 12.9% (on a fully diluted basis) in Biocon Biologics. Viatris also is entitled to $335 million of additional cash payments in 2024. In addition, Viatris and Biocon Biologics have agreed to a closing working capital target of $250\u00a0million. An amount of cash equal to all or a portion of the closing working capital target may become payable to Biocon Biologics in connection with certain events in the future, depending on the valuations attributable to such events. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recognized a gain on sale of approximately $1.75 billion and has not recognized the results of the business in its consolidated financial statements subsequent to November 29, 2022.  Viatris and Biocon Biologics also entered an agreement pursuant to which Viatris is providing commercialization and certain other transition services on behalf of Biocon Biologics, including billings, collections and the remittance of rebates, to ensure business continuity for patients, customers and colleagues. The term of the transition services agreement is generally up to two years. Under the transition services agreement, Viatris is entitled to be reimbursed for its costs (subject to certain caps) plus a markup.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents   In November 2022, the Company provided an update on the strategic priorities announced in February 2022, including identifying the following businesses no longer considered core to its future strategy that the Company intends to divest: \u2022OTC; \u2022API (while retaining some selective development API capabilities); \u2022Women\u2019s health care, primarily related to our oral and injectable contraceptives. This does not include all of our women\u2019s health care related products; as an example, our Xulane\u00ae product in the U.S. is excluded; and \u2022Upjohn Distributor Markets.  During the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Oyster Point for approximately $425\u00a0million in cash, which includes $11 per share paid to Oyster Point stockholders through a tender offer and the repayment of the principal amount of certain debt of Oyster Point. In addition to the upfront cash consideration, each Oyster Point stockholder received one non-tradeable contingent value right representing up to an additional $2 per share, or approximately $60\u00a0million in the aggregate, contingent upon Oyster Point achieving certain metrics based upon full year 2022 performance, which are expected to be determined by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Oyster Point is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of first-in-class pharmaceutical therapies to treat ophthalmic diseases. On November 7, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining equity shares of Famy Life Sciences, a private-owned research company with a complementary portfolio of ophthalmology therapies under development, for a consideration of $281\u00a0million. The Company had previously entered into a Master Development Agreement with Famy Life Sciences on December 20, 2019 to grant the Company rights with respect to acquiring certain pharmaceutical products and had additionally acquired shares representing approximately 13.5% equity interest in Famy Life Sciences for $25.0\u00a0million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The transaction to acquire the remaining equity shares of Famy Life Sciences closed during the first quarter of 2023.  Ophthalmology is one of the key therapeutic areas of focus that the Company announced in February 2022. With the combination of Viatris' global commercial footprint, R&D and regulatory capabilities and supply chain, along with Oyster Point's deep knowledge of the ophthalmology space from a clinical, medical, regulatory and commercial perspective\u2014including a commercial asset, Tyrvaya\u00ae, for the treatment of dry eye disease\u2014and Famy Life Sciences' Phase III-ready pipeline, the Company believes it has the foundation to create a leading global ophthalmology franchise, accelerating efforts to address the unmet needs of patients with ophthalmic disease and the eye care professionals who treat them. The Eye Care division within the company will be led by former Oyster Point CEO, Jeff Nau Ph.D.   Unless otherwise indicated, industry data included in this Item 1 are sourced from IQVIA Holdings Inc. and are for the twelve months ended November 2022. Viatris product and other company data included in this Item 1 are from internal sources and are as of November 30, 2022.   Organization Upjohn was incorporated in Delaware on February 14, 2019 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer to operate the Upjohn Business. Effective as of November 16, 2020, Upjohn changed its name to \u201cViatris Inc.\u201d and became the parent entity of the combined Upjohn Business and Mylan business.  The Upjohn Business was a global, primarily off-patent branded and generic established medicines business, which included 20 primarily off-patent oral solid dose legacy brands, such as Lyrica\u00ae, Lipitor\u00ae, Celebrex\u00ae and Viagra\u00ae.  Mylan was founded in 1961 as a privately-owned company and grew over time into one of the largest manufacturers of generic drugs in the U.S. Mylan became a publicly traded company in 1973. Mylan\u2019s strategy then led to many acquisitions which have played a significant role in the evolution of the company, including Matrix Laboratories Limited (2007); Merck KGaA\u2019s generic and specialty pharmaceutical business (2007); the EPD Business (2015) and Meda AB (publ.) (2016). These acquisitions assisted in creating robust research, manufacturing, supply chain and commercial platforms on a global scale; substantially expanding its portfolio of medicines; diversifying by geography, product type and channel; maintaining its commitment to quality; and cultivating its global workforce. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Since the consummation of the Combination, the Viatris management team has been focused on ensuring that the Company is optimally structured and efficiently resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients, shareholders, customers and other stakeholders.    Business Model and Operations At Viatris, we see healthcare not as it is, but as it should be. We act courageously and are uniquely positioned to be a source of stability in a world of evolving healthcare needs. Viatris empowers people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life. We do so via Access, Leadership and Partnership.  ACCESS  Viatris provides high-quality, trusted medicines, regardless of geography or circumstance. We are committed to improving access to high-quality medicines while working to ensure a reliable supply so patients can get the treatments they need, when and where they need them. Our global portfolio, supported by our science, medical and manufacturing expertise, delivers global iconic and key brands, complex generics, including biosimilars prior to the Biocon Biologics Transaction, generics and OTC products.  We see access as fundamental to empowering people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life\u2014a powerful concept in challenging times.   It begins with our efforts to sustainably deliver high-quality medicines and health solutions at scale to people, regardless of geography or circumstance. As a healthcare company born during a global pandemic, Viatris was formed to bridge the traditional divide between generics and brands, aiming to combine the best of both, to more holistically address healthcare needs globally. With an extensive portfolio of medicines to meet nearly every health need, a one-of-a-kind global supply chain designed to reach more people with health solutions when and where they need them, and the scientific expertise to address some of the world\u2019s most enduring health challenges, access takes on deeper meaning at Viatris.   From our unique vantage point, we touch all of life\u2019s moments, from birth to end of life, acute conditions to chronic diseases. We see across multiple therapeutic areas to the person at the center of their own unique health journey. We are focused on meeting individual needs, whether with a generic medicine, an improved version of an existing medicine, or a truly novel therapeutic solution.   Ultimately, we know we are stronger together. Both as a company and as a global community. Our pursuit of access is relentless. Because health matters everywhere.  As a company, Viatris: \u2022Covers a broad range of therapeutic areas. We produce medicines for patients across a broad range of major therapeutic areas. From cardiovascular health to oncology, Viatris offers quality treatment options across more than 10 major therapeutic areas covering a wide variety of noncommunicable and infectious diseases. We also offer support services such as diagnostic clinics, educational seminars and digital tools to help patients better manage their health. While we intend to maintain our broad range of therapeutic areas, we have, as previously announced, identified three core, global therapeutic areas \u2013 ophthalmology (as evidenced by the Oyster Point and Famy Life Sciences\u2019 acquisitions), gastrointestinal, and dermatology \u2013 that we believe particularly fit our own internal capabilities while leveraging our global platform. \u2022Helps ease the burden of noncommunicable diseases. According to the WHO, NCDs, such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, certain cancers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are among the leading causes of death globally. NCDs affect people of every age, gender and socioeconomic status in every corner of the world, and pose a heavy burden on individuals, families and communities. To overcome this global public health threat, patients  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents  worldwide need a partner they can trust \u2013 one that not only believes everyone deserves good health, but also has the portfolio, experience and expertise to make this belief a reality. \u2022Helps hearts stay healthier. According to the WHO, coronary heart disease is the number one cause of death globally. Viatris collaborates with many organizations to help prevent, diagnose, and treat many cardiovascular illnesses. Our deep experience in emerging and developed markets affords a tried-and-true method of achieving high impact across the patient experience, from awareness to adherence. In close collaboration with governments, healthcare providers, technology partners and patients, we at Viatris work to nurture healthcare systems that can adapt and respond to patients\u2019 ever-changing needs. We continue to collaborate with medical associations, patient advocacy groups and academia to develop innovative, integrated solutions and programs to help strengthen both the delivery and quality of healthcare. \u2022Fights infectious disease. We are also a global leader in treating infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and tuberculosis, and offer an extensive portfolio across these disease states. While many important strides have been made to treat these illnesses, there is still more to be done in countries where lack of access to therapeutics, preventative treatment and diagnostics often result in patients not receiving proper care, and those where HIV transmission continues thirty years into the epidemic. From manufacturing a pediatric-friendly antiretroviral used to treat HIV-positive infants to providing HIV self-tests in some low- and middle-income countries, we are innovating to help patients. An Increasingly Innovative and Differentiated Pipeline Our confidence in the future delivery of our pipeline is rooted in our strong historic development programs and list of firsts, including the first FDA approvals of the generic version of Allergan's Restasis\u00ae and the generic version of Symbicort\u00ae, Breyna\u2122. In addition, we are working on many other programs, including the potential to be first to market for our generics of Abilify Maintena\u00ae, Injectafer\u00ae, Invega Trinza\u00ae, Ozempic\u00ae, Sandostin\u00ae LAR Depot, Venofer\u00ae and Wegovy\u2122. We are also working with our partners on novel and complex products such as our BOTOX\u00ae (onabotulinumtoxinA) biosimilar and Glatiramer Acetate Depot, a long-acting injection version of the approved glatiramer acetate.  While we will continue to diligently pursue important generics opportunities, we will increasingly focus on limited-competition complex and novel products targeting gaps in care, all with a first-to-market emphasis and serving our mission of patient access. Complex product categories are critical to patient health and are growing at a rapid pace. Our goal is to enhance our proven scientific capabilities and current global platform, including our Global Healthcare Gateway\u00ae, to create a durable and higher-margin portfolio of products. And that means further expanding beyond our current scope into more innovative products, including NCEs and global 505(b)(2) products. As previously mentioned, while we intend to maintain our broad range of therapeutic areas, we have identified three core, global therapeutic areas \u2013 ophthalmology, gastrointestinal and dermatology \u2013 that we believe particularly fit our own internal capabilities while leveraging our global platform.    LEADERSHIP  Viatris is advancing sustainable operations and innovative solutions to improve patient health. Viatris is committed to providing steady leadership in a world that is constantly evolving. We take that commitment seriously and know that advancing sustainable operations and innovative solutions to improve patient health requires strong global leadership. We know what it takes to reach more patients with more products, and believe that Viatris is uniquely positioned to make a difference through our: \u2022Powerful global operating platform, which combines what we believe to be best-in-class manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. We have designed our global operations and supply chain to be a reliable and flexible partner for access across the world, constantly adapting to an ever-evolving landscape. Viatris operates approximately 40 manufacturing sites worldwide that produce oral solid doses, injectables, complex dosage forms and APIs on five different continents. Together with a global, flexible and diverse supply chain, our platform strives to mitigate risks of disruption and ensure supply reliability. Our efforts to build a responsive global network have helped us maintain a reliable supply of much needed medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are committed to advancing responsible and sustainable operations and work diligently to minimize our environmental footprint across the Viatris  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents  network while safeguarding access to medicine. As discussed above, our API business (other than some selective development API capabilities) is one of the assets we intend to divest.  \u2022Robust global technical resources, including thousands of scientists, regulatory experts and medical and product safety professionals working around the world on innovative therapies and solutions for patients everywhere. \u2022Strong global commercial team, including sales team members and marketing professionals whose goal is to ensure that products are shipped to customers around the globe. \u2022Diverse and differentiated global portfolio includes products in more than 10 major therapeutic areas, including both infectious diseases and NCDs and medicines that treat the top 10 of the WHO\u2019s leading causes of death globally. We are a leading supplier of medicines to the HIV/AIDS community around the world, with a legacy of providing access to high-quality and affordable ARVs in more than 100 countries.  We believe that Viatris\u2019 global leadership in all of these areas uniquely positions us to efficiently and effectively serve patients regardless of geography or circumstance. Together, with our commitment to provide access to a sustainable, affordable, and diverse portfolio of high-quality medicines and our goal to be a Partner of Choice\u00ae for companies big and small, Viatris works to improve access and meet evolving healthcare needs around the world.  PARTNERSHIP  Leveraging our collective expertise to connect people to products and services. Partnerships and collaborations are critical, as are policies and strong healthcare systems that allow for healthy competitive environments. We have a strong history of partnering with other pharmaceutical companies, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, policymakers, trade associations and alliances, industry researchers and patient advocacy groups to promote sustainable access to treatment, build more resilient healthcare systems and drive these issues within our industry on global, regional and local levels. We hold leadership roles in several industry associations and actively engage with more than 100 groups worldwide to this end. Many of our collaborations focus on access to medicine; public awareness and disease screening; and healthcare professional education and support.   Our Global Healthcare Gateway\u00ae Built to Fuel Growth and Partnerships Our Global Healthcare Gateway\u00ae is open for business. This was evidenced by the fact the Oyster Point and Famy Life Sciences acquisitions were sourced through the Global Healthcare Gateway\u00ae. Through our Global Healthcare Gateway\u00ae\u2014a platform that allows partners to access our many established strengths to reach patients they may not have the resources to reach on their own\u2014we connect more people with even more products and services. We are actively engaging with potential partners to help them accelerate possibilities of using their own healthcare assets to reach more patients by leveraging our unique global platform \u2013 our R&D, supply chain, manufacturing, regulatory, commercial and legal expertise. With the global platforms and infrastructure supporting our innovative Global Healthcare Gateway\u00ae, we are enhancing our capital allocation approach to business development, and our organic and inorganic R&D investments through a focused governance structure to ensure the highest level of strategic decision-making.   Licensing and Other Partner Agreements We periodically enter into commercial licensing and other partner agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the development, manufacture, marketing and/or sale of pharmaceutical products. Doing so helps us share risks and costs, leverage strengths and scale up commercialization, but usually requires us to also share future profits. The result often is that medicines become available sooner and to a significantly larger group of patients. Our significant licensing and other partner agreements are primarily focused on the development, manufacturing, supply and commercialization of multiple, high-value generic compounds and respiratory products, among other complex products. Refer to Note 19 Licensing and Other Partner Agreements included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information. 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Operations Viatris has developed an end-to-end experience across the total product life cycle, which includes global regulatory licensing, launch, growth and post-approval lifecycle management. Our research, development and medical platform seeks to maximize the impact of our existing portfolio by examining whether there is an opportunity for new indications, label extensions, formulations, and market registrations for our products. We also use our platform to determine whether there is an opportunity to integrate new products into our portfolio. The manufacturing of APIs and finished dosage forms is currently performed by a combination of internal and external manufacturing operations. Internally, many of the products we produce are currently vertically integrated; meaning we manufacture both the APIs and finished dosage forms related to those products. Occasionally, however, resources we need are available from only a single supplier. As a result, we supplement our production footprint through arrangements with other manufacturers. However, as discussed above, our API business is one of the assets we intend to divest as we continue to move up the value chain and focus on more complex and innovative products to build a more durable, higher-margin portfolio. We expect to retain some selective development API capabilities and to continue to have access to adequate API supplies through our arrangements with other manufacturers. The Company\u2019s significant manufacturing, warehousing and distribution activities are located primarily in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Singapore, India, Australia, China, and certain E.U. countries, including Ireland. In addition, we maintain administrative facilities around the world. While many of these key facilities are owned, Viatris also leases certain facilities from third parties. We believe all our facilities are in good operating condition, the machinery and equipment are well-maintained, the facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and they have capacities adequate for the current operations. Facilities and records related to our products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where our products are marketed. In addition, authorities often conduct pre-approval plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes comply with current GMP and other regulations, and clinical-trial reviews to evaluate regulatory compliance and data integrity. Our suppliers, contract manufacturers, clinical trial partners and other business partners are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections. The Company remains committed to maintaining the highest quality manufacturing standards at its facilities around the world and to continuous assessment and improvement in a time of evolving industry dynamics and regulatory expectations. We are committed to advancing sustainable operations and innovative solutions to improve patient health. This means we focus on responsible conduct and have global policies and procedures to support our work. Environmental and human health are interconnected, a relationship underscored by climate change and water stress. We work systematically and diligently to minimize our environmental footprint while seeking to safeguard stable access to medicine. In 2022, we launched Viatris\u2019 initial sustainability goals in the areas of access to medicine and health; diversity, equity & inclusion; and the environment: climate change, water risk assessments and waste management. Our near-term science-based emissions reduction targets for scope 1, 2 and 3 have been validated and approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). The SBTi classified Viatris' scope 1 and 2 target ambition and has determined that it is in line with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory, a worldwide goal of limiting global warming. During 2022, we also completed a climate scenario analysis to help us identify and manage risk and opportunities regarding climate impacts. While it is very hard to predict accurately the future costs associated with compliance with environmental laws, this is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our operations or competitive position.   Customers and Marketing Our customers include retail and pharmacy establishments, wholesalers and distributors, payers, insurers and governments, and institutions such as hospitals; among others. See \u201cChannel Types\u201d below for more information about our customers. 13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents  The table below displays the percentage of consolidated net sales to our largest customers during the years ended December\u00a031, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

To best meet customers\u2019 needs, the Company manages its business on a geographic basis. In addition to being dynamic, the pharmaceutical industry is complex. How it functions, how it is regulated and how it provides patients access varies by location. Similarly, competition is affected by many factors. Examples of factors include innovation and development, timely approval of prescription drugs by health authorities, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, marketing effectiveness, portfolio size, customer service, consumer acceptance, product price, political stability and the availability of funding for healthcare. Certain parts of our business also are affected by seasonality, e.g., due to the timing and severity of peak cough, cold and flu incidence, which can cause variability in sales trends for some of our products. While seasonality may affect quarterly comparisons within a fiscal year, it generally is not material to our annual consolidated results. For these and other reasons, the Company\u2019s sales and marketing efforts vary accordingly by product, market and channel type, each of which is described below.  See the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section in Part II. Item 7 of this Form 10-K for more information related to customer arrangements. Products From cardiovascular health to oncology, Viatris offers quality treatment options across more than 10 major therapeutic areas covering a wide variety of noncommunicable and infectious diseases. We also offer support services such as diagnostic clinics, educational seminars and digital tools to help patients better manage their health. We offer a broad and diverse range of treatment options across all our therapeutic areas, with many categories containing several products in a range of dosage forms, formulations and delivery systems that allow physicians to tailor care for optimal treatment. As the Company looks to the future, its goal is to leverage its proven scientific capabilities to create a durable and higher-margin portfolio of products. Viatris intends to continue building the pipeline and focusing on products with greater complexity while also investing in the lifecycle management of certain key products in our current portfolio. The Company also expects to expand further beyond its current scope into more innovative products, including NCEs and global 505(b)(2)s. While Viatris intends to maintain its broad range of therapeutic areas, it has identified three core, global therapeutic areas \u2013 ophthalmology, gastrointestinal, dermatology \u2014 that it believes particularly fit its internal capabilities while leveraging its global platform. The Company is further enhancing its commercial and scientific capabilities as needed for this future portfolio and intends to increase its R&D investment as well as inorganically grow via business development through its Global Healthcare Gateway\u00ae.  Viatris currently markets prescription brand drugs, generic drugs, complex generic drugs, and APIs. Brand drugs typically are prescription pharmaceuticals that are sufficiently novel as to be protected by patents or other forms of exclusivity. As such, these drugs, which bear trade names, may be produced and sold only by those owning the rights, subject to certain challenges that other companies may make. Developing new medicines can take years and significant investment. Only a few promising therapies ever enter clinical trials. Fewer still are approved for sale by health authorities, at which point marketing to healthcare providers and consumers begins. Because patents and exclusivities last many years, they serve as an incentive to developers. During the periods protected, developers often recoup their investments and earn a profit. In many high-income countries, the brand business often is characterized by higher margins on lower volumes - especially as compared with generic manufacturers. Viatris has numerous branded drugs, including iconic brands, as well as several global  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents  key brands to help patients manage their health. Brand drugs include branded generics which are off-patent products that are sold under an approved proprietary name for marketing purposes. Brand products often become branded generics once patent protections or other forms of exclusivity expire. Branded generic products are common in many countries outside the U.S., including emerging markets. Brand and branded generic products are more sensitive to promotion than are unbranded generic products. They therefore represent the primary focus of most of our sales representatives and product-level marketing activity. Our OTC products, which are sold directly to consumers without a prescription and without reimbursement, are generally sold under a brand name. As discussed above, our OTC business is one of the assets we intend to divest. Generic drugs are therapeutically equivalent versions of brand drugs. Generics generally become available once the patents and other exclusivities on their branded counterparts expire. The generics business is generally characterized by lower margins on higher volumes of a relatively large number of products. Our generic medicines work in the same way and provide the same clinical benefits as their as their brand-name counterparts and may cost less, providing patients and the healthcare system important savings and medicine options which we believe are essential to making healthcare accessible. The manufacturing of generic medicines is held to the same standards of GMP by health authorities as the manufacturing of branded medicines. National health authorities inspect our facilities around the world to ensure that generic manufacturing, packaging and testing sites pass the same quality standards as those of brand drugs. Gx products typically are sold under their INNs. INNs facilitate the identification of pharmaceutical substances or APIs. Each INN is unique and globally recognized. A nonproprietary name also is known as a generic name.  Complex generic drugs are generic medicines that could have a complex active ingredient, complex formulation, complex route of delivery or complex drug device combinations. Viatris offers a number of these important medicines to patients, including our Wixela Inhub\u00ae, the first generic of ADVAIR DISKUS\u00ae and glatiramer acetate injection, a generic version of Copaxone\u00ae, for example.  While we will continue to diligently pursue important generics opportunities, we will increasingly focus on limited-competition complex and novel products targeting gaps in care, all with a first-to-market emphasis and serving our mission of patient access. We believe complex products categories are critical to patient health and are growing at a rapid pace.  APIs are responsible for the therapeutic effects of medicines. We are one of the world\u2019s largest producers of APIs, providing them to customers in more than 100 countries. We are the leading producer of API used in generic ARVs, which treat HIV/AIDS. We also produce API for products in the following areas: antibacterial; central nervous system agents; antihistamines/antiasthmatics; cardiovascular, antivirals; antidiabetics; antifungals; and proton pump inhibitors. Our APIs are sold through a dedicated sales and marketing team primarily to pharmaceutical companies throughout the world. As discussed above, our API business is one of the assets we intend to divest. We expect to retain some selective development API capabilities and to continue to have access to adequate API supplies through our arrangements with other manufacturers. Viatris invests significant sums in R&D and in manufacturing capacity.   We also often incur substantial litigation expense as a result of defending or challenging brand patents or exclusivities, which is described further in Note 20 included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  Market Types Viatris focuses its sales and marketing efforts on the people who make key decisions around pharmaceutical prescribing, dispensing or buying. Decision-makers vary by country or region, reflecting law and custom, giving rise to different types of pharmaceutical markets. Many countries feature a mix of or hybrids of various market types, though the Company may focus on just one type in a particular country. In prescription markets, physicians decide which medicines patients will take. Pharmacies then dispense the products as directed. Drug companies employ sales forces to educate doctors about the clinical benefits of their products. Representatives call on individual doctors or group practices; the process is known as detailing. Examples of countries served by Viatris that are mainly prescription markets are the U.S. brand business, Japan, China, Turkey, Poland and Mexico. In substitution markets, pharmacists generally are authorized (and in some cases required) by law to dispense an unbranded or branded generic, if available, in place of a brand-name medicine, or vice versa. Drug companies may use sales forces in these markets too, with representatives calling on and educating pharmacy personnel about their organization and products. Examples of countries served by Viatris that are mainly substitution markets are France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Australia. 15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents  In tender markets, payers, such as governments or insurance companies, negotiate the lowest price for a drug (or group of drugs) on behalf of their constituents or members. In exchange, the chosen supplier\u2019s product is placed on the payer\u2019s formulary, or list of covered prescriptions. Often, a supplier\u2019s drug is the only one available in an entire class of drugs. Large sales forces are not needed to reach these decision-makers. Examples of generic markets served by Viatris that are mainly tender markets are New Zealand, Sweden, South Africa, as well as Germany. In distribution markets, retailers and wholesalers make drug-purchasing decisions. Large sales forces are not needed to reach the decision-makers representing these organizations. Note, however, that pharmacists operating in distribution markets also may be authorized to make substitution decisions when dispensing medicines. Examples of countries served by Viatris that are mainly distribution markets are the U.S. generics business, the U.K. and Norway. The allocation of our sales and marketing resources reflects the characteristics of these different market types.  In the case of OTC products, consumers are the decision-makers. OTC products are commonly sold via retail channels, such as pharmacies, drugstores and supermarkets. This makes their sale and marketing comparable to other retail businesses, with broad advertising and trade-channel promotion. Consumers often are loyal to well-known OTC brands. For this reason, suppliers of OTC products, Viatris included, must invest the time and resources needed to build strong OTC brand names. As disclosed previously, the OTC business is no longer considered core to our future strategy, and we plan to divest it.  Channel Types Viatris\u2019 products make their way to patients through a variety of intermediaries, or channels.  Pharmaceutical wholesalers/distributors purchase prescription medicines and other medical products directly from manufacturers for storage in warehouses and distribution centers. The distributors then fill orders placed by healthcare providers and other authorized buyers. Pharmaceutical retailers purchase products directly from manufacturers or wholesalers/distributors. They then sell them to consumers in relatively small quantities for personal use. Institutional pharmacies address the unique needs of hospitals, nursing homes and other such venues. Among the services provided are specialized packaging, including for injectables and unit-dose products, for controlled administration. Mail-order and e-commerce pharmacies receive prescriptions by mail, fax, phone or the internet at a central location; process them in large, mostly automated centers; and mail the drugs to the consumer. Specialty pharmacies focus on managing the handling and service requirements associated with high-cost and more-complex drug therapies, such as those used to treat patients with rare or serious diseases.  Business Segments Viatris has four reportable segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, JANZ, and Emerging Markets. The Company reports segment information on the basis of markets and geography, which reflects its focus on bringing its broad and diversified portfolio of branded, complex generics, including biosimilars prior to the Biocon Biologics Transaction, and generic products to people in markets everywhere. Our Developed Markets segment comprises our operations primarily in North America and Europe. Our Greater China segment includes our operations in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Our JANZ segment reflects our operations in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Our Emerging Markets segment encompasses our presence in more than 125 countries with developing markets and emerging economies including in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East as well as the Company\u2019s ARV franchise. Developed Markets  The Developed Markets segment comprises our operations primarily in North America and Europe. The Company\u2019s business in North America is driven mainly by our operations in the U.S., where we are one of the largest providers of prescription medicines. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is very competitive, and the primary means of competition are innovation and development, timely FDA approval, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, marketing, portfolio size, customer service, reputation and price. We rely on cost-effective manufacturing processes to meet the rapidly changing needs of our customers around a reliable, high quality supply of generic pharmaceutical products. Europe, where many governments provide healthcare at a low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels,  16 16 16 Table of Contents Table of Contents  continues to be a highly competitive market, especially in terms of pricing, quality standards, service levels and product portfolio. Our leadership position in a number of countries provides us a platform to fulfill the needs of patients, physicians, pharmacies, customers and payors. Significant products sold by the Developed Markets segment include Lyrica\u00ae, Lipitor\u00ae, Creon\u00ae, Influvac\u00ae, Wixela Inhub\u00ae, EpiPen\u00ae Auto-Injector, Fraxiparine\u00ae, and Yupelri\u00ae.  New product launches are an important growth driver. Important recent launches include SEMGLEE\u00ae, cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion, and lenalidomide in the U.S. While our U.S. customer base is extensive, it increasingly comprises a small number of very large firms as the pharmaceutical industry has undergone and continues to undergo tremendous change and consolidation. We believe Viatris is well positioned to serve such customers in the Developed Markets due to the scale we have built in terms of R&D, manufacturing, and portfolio breadth. Greater China The Greater China segment includes our operations in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Since the closing of the Combination, the Viatris Greater China portfolio is predominantly branded LOE products.   In China, the recent healthcare reform measures are aimed at controlling the overall healthcare costs, while providing better and broader care to the population. Healthcare spending is expected to increase in-line with GDP growth. The VBP policy for LOE molecules is now in its fourth year and includes more than 290 molecules. All major Viatris brands are included in the VBP molecule lists. We have re-balanced our business to expand our focus on the retail pharmacy and e-commerce channels while maintaining our presence in the hospital channel. Healthcare consumerism, increased spending power, and demand for premium medical products have generated strong growth in these new channels and partially absorbed the reductions seen in hospital channel due to VBP. Additional pricing and volume pressure for pharmaceutical products sold in the hospital channels is expected to continue during 2023 and could negatively impact our results of operations. For additional information, see \u201cRisk Factors - We have and may continue to experience pressure on the pricing of and reimbursements for certain of our products due to pricing controls, social or government pressure to lower the cost of drugs, and consolidation across the supply chain.\u201d Significant products within the Greater China segment include Lipitor\u00ae, Norvasc\u00ae, and Viagra\u00ae. JANZ The JANZ segment consists of our operations in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. In Japan, the NHI regulates the pricing of pharmaceutical products to healthcare providers. The Company sells products in Japan primarily through a network of wholesalers who then sell the products to doctors, hospitals and pharmacies. In Australia, the healthcare system is a mix of public and private healthcare sectors, with Medicare, Australia\u2019s public healthcare system, covering most of the country\u2019s medical costs. The Department of Health oversees healthcare governance, law, and policy while the various state and territory governments administer the system. Most prescription pharmaceutical products are subsidized under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by the federal government. Pricing of reimbursed pharmaceutical products is regulated by the government and funded via the Medicare levy and through company and patient contributions. The Company sells products primarily through the wholesale system, while promoting its products to both physicians and pharmacists. Significant products within the JANZ segment include AMITIZA\u00ae, Lipacreon\u00ae, Lyrica\u00ae, Norvasc\u00ae, and Effexor\u00ae. Emerging Markets The Emerging Markets segment encompasses our presence in more than 125 countries with developing markets and emerging economies including in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East as well as the Company\u2019s ARV franchise. With healthcare at various stages of development across these markets, we believe we are positioned to not only leverage our large geographical footprint to maximize the similarities between these markets, but also tailor solutions to meet local need. There is demand in this segment for better healthcare to serve a growing population and economic expansion. Many countries in this segment are brand-conscious with generic penetration rates lower than developed markets.   Among our products sold in the segment are Lipitor\u00ae, Lyrica\u00ae, Norvasc\u00ae, Celebrex\u00ae, and ARVs.  17 17 17 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Refer to Note 16 Segment Information included in Part II. Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information about our segments.  Government Regulation Regulation by governmental authorities is a significant factor in the R&D, manufacture, marketing, sales and distribution of pharmaceuticals. Our products are subject to robust developmental studies which include analytical determinations of strength, quality, purity as well as rigorous safety and efficacy determinations using preclinical, pharmacokinetic studies and clinical evaluations to gather data to support regulatory review and approval. This body of work results in extensive data and scientific information that is incorporated into a given product\u2019s regulatory dossier. Manufacturing is conducted under exacting conditions governed by extensive regulation including strict in-process and finished pharmaceutical products specifications and controls. Post-approval activities, such as advertising and promotion, pharmacovigilance, post-marketing regulatory commitments, and pharmacopeial monographs, are subject to extensive regulation and controls as well.  The lengthy process of developing products and obtaining required approvals and the continuing need for post-approval compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained, may be limited in scope. Further, approved drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing post-marketing review and inspection, which can lead to the discovery of previously unknown attributes of the products or the manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their production, which may impact the marketing of the products or result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market.  Any failure or delay by us, our suppliers of manufactured drug product, collaborators or licensees, in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products and our ability to receive product revenue, license revenue or profit-sharing payments. Other Regulatory Requirements Our business is subject to a wide range of various other federal, state, non-governmental, and local agency rules and regulations. They focus on fraud and corruption, pricing and reimbursement, data privacy, and the environment, among many other considerations. For more information about certain of these regulations and the associated risks we face, see Part I. Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.  Research and Development Our R&D organization, which includes developers and regulatory and clinical experts, work collaboratively across our different R&D centers around the world, which include technology-focused development sites and global R&D centers.   Our research, development and clinical platform, which includes regulatory activities, seeks to deliver new product opportunities across all of our categories and markets and to evaluate opportunities to expand the scope of our existing product portfolio with a focus on development activities. Our product pipeline includes a variety of dosage forms, including oral solid dosage forms, transdermals, injectables, inhalation, and other delivery systems. While committed to generics and specialty products, over the last several years, a greater portion of our investments has been focused on complex or difficult-to-formulate products, such as biosimilars and modified release injectables, rather than on commodity products, such as conventional oral solid dosage forms. For example, we are working on a number of programs including the potential to be first to market for our generics of Abilify Maintena\u00ae, Injectafer\u00ae, Invega Trinza\u00ae, Ozempic\u00ae, Sandostin\u00ae LAR Depot, Venofer\u00ae and Wegovy\u2122. We are also working with our partners on novel and/or complex products such as our biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae (onabotulinumtoxinA) and Glatiramer Acetate Depot, a long-acting injection version of the approved glatiramer acetate. As previously mentioned, to facilitate our future growth, we expect to expand our current scope of development into more innovative products, including NCEs and global 505(b)(2) products with a particular focus on three therapeutic areas: ophthalmology, gastrointestinal and dermatology and intend to increase our R&D investment as well as inorganically grow via business development through our Global Healthcare Gateway\u00ae.   Intellectual Property We consider the protection of our intellectual property rights to be extremely valuable, and we act to protect them from infringement by third parties. We have an extensive trademark portfolio totaling more than 35,000 trademarks filed globally and routinely apply to register key brand-name, generic, branded generic, and trade names in numerous countries around the world. Our registered  18 18 18 Table of Contents Table of Contents  trademarks are renewable indefinitely, and these registrations are properly maintained in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they are registered. We also have an extensive patent portfolio and actively file for patent protection in various countries to protect our brand-name, generic, branded generic, and OTC products, including processes for making and using them. We have more than 3,100 patents filed globally. For additional information, see Part I. Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors - We rely on the effectiveness of our patents, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights\u201d of this Form 10-K. Further, we have well-established safeguards in place to protect our proprietary know-how and trade secrets, both of which we consider extremely valuable to our intellectual property portfolio.  We look for intellectual property licensing opportunities to or from third parties, related not only to our existing products, but as a means for expanding our product portfolio. We rely on the aforementioned types of intellectual property, as well as our copyrights, trade dress, regulatory exclusivities and contractual protections, to establish a broad scope of intellectual property rights for our product portfolio.  Human Capital Our people, our culture Our approximately 37,000 diverse colleagues are fueled by a shared passion, purpose, and genuine care for the patients we serve. To us, that means empowering patients worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life. It also means empowering our colleagues to be the best they can be every day. This is our mindset as we build our performance-driven, highly engaging and inclusive culture: \u201cThe Viatris Way\u201d. Since the launch of Viatris in November 2020, the Company believes it has taken great strides to create an employee experience and culture where colleagues are encouraged to reach their full potential. We have had several accomplishments that lay the foundation for the kind of company we want to be, including:  \u2022Being recognized on the Forbes\u00ae 2022 World\u2019s Best Employers list for the second year in a row, inclusion on lists such as Fortune's Change the World, Newsweek's America's Most Responsible Companies, Capital Magazine's Best Employers in France, a Great Place to Work\u00ae certification in India, HR Asia's Best Companies to Work for in Asia (Taiwan), and Top Employers Institute\u2019s certification as one of the 101 top employers in China;  \u2022In 2022, we conducted our first-ever Viatris Voice Survey with approximately 89% of our employees from around the world sharing their perspectives on: Engagement; Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (\u201cDE&I\u201d); Health & Well-Being; and Transformation & Change. The survey also marked a milestone in our commitment to creating our culture The Viatris Way: one that is performance-driven, highly engaging, and inclusive; and \u2022Diverse perspectives drive innovation and our ability to make a difference in the world. We continue to progress on our commitment to DE&I aiming to engage at least 90% of all colleagues globally in DE&I foundational learning in 2023, and by forming our inaugural Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d). We have four forming ERGs including: EmpoWer advocating for an ecosystem that empowers women to reach their full potential; VIVID supporting LGBTQ+ employees and allies; Black colleagues; and, Caregivers.  Talent, learning and development Supporting our colleagues in their learning and development can make a difference in the lives of our patients around the world.  We provide the tools and resources to help colleagues achieve their performance and development goals.  We are committed to continuously anticipating, developing and acquiring new capabilities.  We have an extensive learning and development portfolio of resources and programs and we are introducing new focused development programs and resources via our new Viatris Development Principles: Develop, Invest, Diversify, Innovate, Build and Achieve.   Diversity, equity and inclusion  Understanding and embracing what makes individuals unique is essential to Viatris\u2019 mission. The diversity we foster within our teams can be one of our greatest strengths in redefining healthcare not as it is, but as it should be. In 2022, we established initial goals in DE&I in the areas of foundational learning, and increasing diversity in management for women,  19 19 19 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Black and Hispanic/LatinX employees. We look forward to reporting out on our actions and progress going forward in our annual Sustainability Report.  Viatris strives to create a positive, productive work environment where integrity, dignity and mutual respect for all are valued. We are an equal opportunity employer and discrimination and harassment are strictly prohibited. Together, we are building a highly inclusive organization and our goal is to provide a safe, supportive community where employees feel they belong and can use their unique experiences, perspectives and skills to make a difference in the lives of others. Our ERGs bring colleagues together to listen and learn from each other and raise awareness to change our company and communities for the better, and our Viatris Voice Survey demonstrates positive results in colleague sentiment for engagement and DE&I in addition to other areas of strength.  Health and Safety  We cultivate a culture of health and safety throughout our global workforce by ensuring that our colleagues and contractors are made aware of issues relevant to their work and providing them with the personal protective equipment and knowledge required to perform their jobs safely. Further, we work to ensure that our systems and processes are designed to identify and reduce health and safety risks or impacts on the communities in which we operate.   Employee well-being and safety Viatris is also committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors and visitors. In addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and helping meet urgent global health needs, tens of thousands of dedicated Viatris employees across the world have worked to help ensure a stable supply of much needed treatments.   Because protecting the health and safety of our workforce remains paramount, we continue to align with government directives and the advice of relevant international, national and local health authorities at every Viatris facility around the world. Many of our colleagues are working in manufacturing facilities, where we have continued to take extra precautions to protect our site personnel and operations. In 2021, we issued principles in support of hybrid-remote work to guide the development of local policies where possible. We offer a wide range of benefits and programs that are locally customized to meet the unique needs of employees, and regularly offer advice and support to our employees including providing resources that support well-being for our colleagues around the world.
