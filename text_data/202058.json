Additional information regarding the composition of CS revenue of $4.2 billion for fiscal 2022 is as follows:   For a discussion of certain risks affecting this segment, including risks relating to our supply chain disruptions, see \u201cItem\u00a01. Business - Materials, Suppliers and Seasonality\u201d and \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Report.   International Business Revenue from products and services where the end consumer is located outside the U.S., including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was $3.9\u00a0billion (23% of our revenue), $3.9\u00a0billion (22% of our revenue) and $3.7\u00a0billion (20% of our revenue), in fiscal 2022, 2021  _____________________________________________________________________4 _____________________________________________________________________4 _____________________________________________________________________4   and 2020, respectively. Direct export sales are primarily denominated in U.S.\u00a0Dollars, whereas sales from foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary. For financial information regarding our domestic and international operations, including long-lived assets, see Note 24: Business Segments in the Notes. The majority of our international marketing activities are conducted through subsidiaries that operate in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d) and Asia-Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d) regions and Canada. We also have established international marketing organizations and several regional sales offices. For further information regarding our international subsidiaries, see Exhibit\u00a021 of this Report. International revenue for fiscal 2022 came from a large number of countries, and no single foreign country accounted for more than 5% of our total revenue. Some of our exports are paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried on an open account. Advance payments, progress payments or other similar payments received prior to or upon shipment often cover most of the related costs incurred. Significant foreign government contracts generally require us to provide performance guarantees. In order to remain competitive in international markets, we also enter into offset agreements or recourse or vendor financing arrangements to facilitate sales to certain customers. We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers, distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically and internationally. These independent representatives may buy for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or government customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or established by the independent representative and may be above or below our list prices. Our dealers and distributors generally receive a discount from our list prices and may mark up those prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer.  The particular economic, social and political conditions for business conducted outside the U.S.\u00a0differ from those encountered by U.S. businesses. We believe that the overall business risk for our international business as a whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic businesses as a whole. A description of the types of risks to which we are subject in our international business is contained in \u201cItem\u00a01A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Report. In our opinion, these risks are partially mitigated by the diversification of our international business and the protection provided by letters of credit and advance payments, progress payments and other similar payments. Competitive Conditions and Trends in Market Demand We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to technological advances. Some of our competitors in each of our markets are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels of expenditures for research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d). In each of our markets, we concentrate on the opportunities that we believe are compatible with our resources, overall technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive factors in these markets are product and systems quality and reliability; technological capabilities, including reliable, resilient and innovative cyber capabilities; service; past performance; ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness. We frequently \u201cpartner\u201d or are involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. We compete domestically and internationally against large aerospace and defense companies; principally BAE Systems, Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon Technologies and Thales; and, increasingly, non-traditional defense contractors.  For further discussion of trends in market demand, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Report.  Principal Customers; Government Contracts The percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S.\u00a0Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S.\u00a0Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was 74%, 75% and 78% in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 5% of our revenue in fiscal 2022. Additional information regarding customers for each of our segments is provided under \u201cItem\u00a01. Business\u00a0\u2014 Description of Business by Segment\u201d of this Report. Our U.S.\u00a0Government sales are predominantly derived from contracts with departments and agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S.\u00a0Government. Most of the sales in our SAS and IMS segments are made directly or indirectly to the U.S.\u00a0Government under contracts or subcontracts containing standard government contract clauses providing for redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination for the convenience of the U.S.\u00a0Government or for default based on performance. Our U.S.\u00a0Government contracts and subcontracts include both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (\u201cGWACs\u201d) and multi-vendor indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (\u201cIDIQ\u201d)  _____________________________________________________________________5 _____________________________________________________________________5 _____________________________________________________________________5   contracts, which can include task orders for each contract type, require us to compete both for the initial contract and then for individual task or delivery orders under such contracts. Our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs plus payment of a fee and fall into three basic types: (i)\u00a0cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide for payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of performance; (ii)\u00a0cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which provide for payment of a fee that may increase or decrease, within specified limits, based on actual results compared with contractual targets relating to factors such as cost, performance and delivery schedule; and (iii)\u00a0cost-plus award-fee contracts, which provide for payment of an award fee determined at the customer\u2019s discretion based on our performance against pre-established performance criteria. Under our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on contract progress. Some overhead costs have been made partially or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or regulation. Examples include certain merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs, charitable contributions, interest expense and certain litigation defense costs. Our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work or sell a specific product for a fixed price and, as a result, benefit from cost savings and carry the burden of cost overruns. Under our U.S. Government fixed-price incentive contracts, we share with the U.S.\u00a0Government both savings accrued for performance at less than target cost as well as costs incurred in excess of target cost up to a negotiated ceiling price, which is higher than the target cost, but carry the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price. Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be adjusted up or down depending on whether specified performance objectives are met. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts, we generally receive from the U.S.\u00a0Government either milestone payments totaling 100% of the contract price or monthly progress payments in amounts equaling 80% of costs incurred under the contract. The remaining amounts, including profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items and deliverables under the contract. Our production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts and development contracts are generally cost-reimbursable contracts.  As stated above, U.S.\u00a0Government contracts are terminable for the convenience of the U.S.\u00a0Government, as well as for default based on performance. Companies supplying goods and services to the U.S.\u00a0Government are dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in U.S.\u00a0Government policies resulting from various military, political, economic and international developments. Long-term U.S. Government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for subsequent performance periods become unavailable. Under contracts terminable for the convenience of the U.S.\u00a0Government, a contractor is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done. Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that the U.S.\u00a0Government pays only for the work it has accepted and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost of re-procurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages. In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under many U.S.\u00a0Government contracts, we are required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD and other Federal agency requirements.  From time to time, we may begin performance of a U.S. Government contract under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties. In these arrangements, the U.S. Government has the ability to unilaterally definitize the contract if a mutual agreement regarding terms, specifications and price cannot be reached.  The U.S.\u00a0Government has increased its focus on procurement process improvement initiatives and has implemented certain changes in its procurement practices. These developments may change the way U.S.\u00a0Government contracts are solicited, negotiated and managed, which may affect whether and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the U.S.\u00a0Government, including the terms and conditions under which we do so, which may have an adverse impact to our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.  For further discussion of risks relating to U.S.\u00a0Government contracts, see \u201cItem\u00a01A. Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cItem\u00a03. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Report.  _____________________________________________________________________6 _____________________________________________________________________6 _____________________________________________________________________6   Backlog Company-wide total backlog was $22.3 billion at December\u00a030, 2022, of which $16.2 billion was funded backlog, compared with $21.1 billion at December\u00a031, 2021, of which $15.2 billion was funded backlog. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of the revenue associated with Company-wide total backlog by the end of 2023 and approximately 75% of the revenue associated with Company-wide total backlog by the end of 2024, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. However, we can give no assurance of such fulfillment or that our backlog will become revenue in any particular period, if at all. Backlog is subject to delivery delays and program cancellations, which are beyond our control. We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been authorized and, in the case of U.S.\u00a0Government customers, appropriated. The level of order activity related to U.S. Government programs can be affected by the timing of U.S. Government funding authorizations and project evaluation cycles. Year-over-year comparisons could, at times, be impacted by these factors, among others.  We define unfunded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has not been authorized and, in the case of U.S. Government customers, appropriated. The determination of the unfunded portion of total backlog involves substantial estimating, particularly with respect to customer requirements contracts and development and production contracts of a cost-reimbursable or incentive nature. We do not include the value of unexercised contract options or potential orders under IDIQ contracts in our unfunded backlog. For backlog information for each of our business segments, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Report. See Note 23: Backlog in the Notes for additional information regarding Company-wide total backlog.  Research and Development Company-sponsored R&D costs, which include R&D for commercial products and services and independent R&D related to government products and services, were $603 million, $692 million and $684 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A portion of our independent R&D costs are allocated among contracts and programs in process under U.S.\u00a0Government contractual arrangements. Company-sponsored R&D costs not otherwise allocable are charged to expense when incurred. Company-sponsored research is directed to the development of new products and services and to building technological capability in various markets.  Customer-sponsored R&D costs are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements, principally U.S. Government-sponsored contracts requiring us to provide a product or service meeting certain defined performance or other specifications (such as designs). This research helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. Customer-sponsored research costs are accounted for principally by the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method and included in our revenue and cost of product sales and services. See Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes for further information on the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition. Patents and Other Intellectual Property We consider our patents and other intellectual property, in the aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a large portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property, including reliable, resilient and innovative cyber capabilities, and we routinely apply for new patents, trademarks and copyrights. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. As of December\u00a030, 2022, we held approximately 2,300 U.S.\u00a0patents and 1,800 foreign patents, and had approximately 300 U.S.\u00a0patent applications pending and 300\u00a0foreign patent applications pending. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills also make an important contribution to our business. Although our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our business and the operations of our business segments, we do not consider our business or any business segment to be materially dependent on any single patent, license or other intellectual property right, or any group of related patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights. We are engaged in a proactive patent licensing program and have entered into a number of licenses and cross-license agreements, some of which generate royalty income. Although existing license agreements have generated income in past years and may do so in the future, there can be no assurances we will enter into additional income-producing license agreements. From time to time, we engage in litigation to protect our patents and other intellectual property. Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive advantages. For further discussion of risks relating to intellectual property, see \u201cItem\u00a01A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Report. With regard to certain patents, the U.S.\u00a0Government has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to which the U.S.\u00a0Government may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant to similar arrangements, the U.S.\u00a0Government may  _____________________________________________________________________7 _____________________________________________________________________7 _____________________________________________________________________7   consent to our use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with our products are also considered to be a valuable asset. Government Regulations Our company is subject to various Federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the development, manufacturing, sale and distribution of our products and services, and it is our policy to comply with the applicable laws in each jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Regulations include, but are not limited to, those related to import and export controls, corruption, bribery, the protection of the environment, government procurement, wireless communications, competition, product safety, workplace health and safety, employment, labor and data privacy. The following describes significant regulations that may impact our businesses. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulations, see \u201cItem\u00a01A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Report. Import/Export Regulations. We sell products and solutions to customers all over the world and are required to comply with U.S. export control regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) and the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and economic and trade sanctions programs limiting or banning sales into certain countries. Countries outside of the U.S. have implemented similar controls and sanction regulations. Together, these controls and regulations may impose licensing requirements on exports of certain technology and software from the U.S. and may impact our ability to transact business in certain countries or with certain customers. We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of these programs and regulations, and we regularly monitor changes in the law and regulations and create strategies to deal with changes. Changes in the law may restrict or further restrict our ability to sell products and solutions. Anti-Corruption Regulations. Because we have significant international operations, we must comply with complex regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anti-competition regulations. We have compliance policies, programs and training to prevent non-compliance with such anti-corruption regulations in the U.S. and outside the U.S. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory changes that may impact our business and develop strategies to address the changes and incorporate them into existing compliance programs. Environmental. Our operations are subject to and affected by U.S. Federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. We have previously announced our environmental sustainability goals: to reduce greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions by 30% and water usage by 20% from 2019 levels and achieve a 75% solid waste diversion rate (away from landfills) by 2026. We are investing in renewable energy, including entering into a virtual power purchase agreement, and other solutions to achieve our GHG emission reduction target and our other environmental sustainability goals. In 2022, we measured our performance against these goals and exceeded our GHG emissions target, met our water use reduction target and are progressing forward in regards to our solid waste diversion rate from landfill. Additional information is provided in our Sustainability Report which can be found on our Company website, and is not incorporated by reference into this Report. We have incurred, and based on currently available information, we expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with existing and pending environmental laws and regulations. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cItem\u00a03. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Report and Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies and Note 25: Legal Proceedings and Contingencies in the Notes. _____________________________________________________________________8 _____________________________________________________________________8 _____________________________________________________________________8   Materials, Suppliers and Seasonality Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide array of materials, such as electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and plastics needed for our operations and for our products. We are dependent on suppliers and subcontractors for a large number of components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent on one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature of a particular item or because of local content preference requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. In addition, in connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts, including microelectronics components, from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. Although we have been affected by financial and performance issues of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, other than in our CS segment, we have not been materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain materials or products. On occasion, we have experienced component shortages from vendors as a result of pandemics, natural disasters, or the shifting regulatory landscape. These events or regulations may cause a spike in demand for certain electronic components, such as lead-free components, resulting in industry-wide supply chain disruptions.  Revenue and operating income have been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions, primarily in our CS segment. While our product demand remains strong, we can give no assurances and the ultimate extent of the supply chain disruptions to our CS segment remains uncertain. For further discussion of risks relating to subcontractors and suppliers, see \u201cItem\u00a01A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Report.  We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of contract awards and the timing and availability of U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance. Human Capital  As a global aerospace and defense technology company, our performance is dependent on our highly educated and skilled workforce for our success. Attracting, developing, motivating and retaining highly skilled employees, particularly those with technical, engineering and science backgrounds and experience, is a critical factor in our ability to execute our strategic priorities. We use human capital measures to set goals and monitor performance in several areas, including employee health and safety; talent acquisition, development and retention; and diversity, equity and inclusion. Workforce Demographics. We had approximately 46,000 employees at December\u00a030, 2022, including approximately 20,000 engineers and scientists. Approximately\u00a088% of our employees are located in the U.S. and a significant number of our employees possess a U.S.\u00a0Government security clearance. As of December\u00a030, 2022, approximately 2,500, or 6%, of our U.S. employees were covered by various collective bargaining agreements, which we expect will be renegotiated as they expire, as we historically have done without significant disruption to operating activities.  Health and Safety. We strive to maintain a safe work environment for all employees and eliminate workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We review and monitor our performance closely to reduce Occupational Safety and Health Administration reportable incidents. For fiscal 2022, our total recordable injury rate declined by 17% and lost day injury rate declined by 18%, compared with the previous year, while numerous locations across L3Harris reached one year or more without a recordable injury.  Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention. Our talent acquisition, development and retention strategy is focused on attracting the best talent and recognizing and rewarding performance while continually developing, engaging and retaining high-performing employees. We strive to attract employees in all stages of their careers. In addition to hiring approximately 7,500 new employees, L3Harris was recognized with nearly 15 employer awards or recognitions from external organizations in fiscal 2022. Our development philosophy centers around creating broad experiences, setting \u201cSMART\u201d (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely) performance goals and offering continuous feedback and learning opportunities. We provide formal and informal development aligned with individual learning styles including: self-directed personal and professional development through e-learning, books and videos; professional certification support; leadership development programs developed in partnership with leading universities; rotational development programs; and on-the-job learning. Annually and quarterly, we assign learning content that supports our \u201ce3\u201d operating system (excellence, everywhere, everyday), Code of Conduct, ethical standards, compliance with laws applicable to our business and responsibility for safety and environmental goals. We offer competitive salaries and comprehensive benefit packages, including health care, retirement planning and employer retirement contributions, educational assistance, child and elder back-up care, paid parental leave  _____________________________________________________________________9 _____________________________________________________________________9 _____________________________________________________________________9   and a discretionary paid time off program. In addition, our Ramp program is designed to support employees in transition, including those returning to work from parental leave or preparing for retirement. Finally, we have established a comprehensive listening strategy to help us better understand the employee experience through the use of multiple surveys over the course of the employee lifecycle. We use this feedback, in conjunction with external benchmarking and research, to identify areas in which we can enhance the employee experience and ensure every person feels engaged and motivated to do their best work. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to continue to innovate and develop new solutions to solve our customers\u2019 most critical challenges, and that diversity of thought, experience, perspective and background drives innovation. We have established two clear goals: half of our workforce will be women and at least a third will be people of color. We are investing in an inclusive, equitable and diverse workforce by supporting a variety of science, technology, engineering and mathematics initiatives. We also have an established diversity council, co-chaired by our CEO and comprised of employee resource group leadership and executives from across the Company, to evaluate and influence the strategies, policies and steps we take to advance diversity, equity and inclusion. We offer nine employee resource groups that bring together employees from diverse backgrounds and foster networking, professional development and community outreach opportunities. We also further build inclusive behaviors and culture through ongoing learning throughout the year, encouraging conversation and action through initiatives like our annual \u201cDay of Understanding\u201d event, \u201cSix Signature Traits for Inclusive Leadership\u201d training and our inaugural virtual \u201cInclusion Conference.\u201d Finally, we believe that celebrating inclusivity, equity and our unique and diverse backgrounds and experiences makes us stronger, demonstrated by our various listening and communications strategies that celebrate the unique storytelling and voices of employees, such as our \u201cI am L3Harris\u201d series. Through the above and other efforts, we have improved the diversity of our workforce and we continue to work toward our long-term goals.
