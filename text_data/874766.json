In addition, the Company offers insurance products to customers of payroll service providers through its relationships with major national payroll companies in the United States and to members of affinity organizations. As the sole corporate member of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221 (\"Lloyd's Syndicate\"), the Company has the exclusive right to underwrite business up to an approved level of premium in the Lloyd\u2019s of London (\"Lloyds\") market. In the United States, independent agents, brokers and wholesalers are consolidating and this trend is expected to continue. This will likely result in a larger proportion of written premium being concentrated among fewer agents, brokers and wholesalers.

Risk modeling is used to manage, within specified limits, the aggregate exposure taken in each line of business and across the Company. For property and casualty business, aggregate exposure limits are set by geographic zone and peril. Products are priced according to the risk characteristics of the insured\u2019s exposures. Rates charged for Personal Lines products are filed with the states in which we write business. Rates for most Commercial Lines products are also filed with the states but the premium charged may be modified based on the insured\u2019s relative risk profile and workers\u2019 compensation policies may be subject to modification based on prior loss experience. The Company also writes coverage in the excess and surplus lines market, primarily within global specialty, which is characterized by the absence of regulation related to rate and form and allows for more pricing and coverage flexibility to write certain classes of business. Pricing for Group Benefits products, including long-term disability and life insurance, is also based on an underwriting of the risks and a projection of estimated losses, including consideration of investment income.Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company\u2019s response to rate actions taken by competitors, its expense levels and expectations about regulatory and legal developments. The Company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments and the Lloyd's Syndicate's ability to write business is subject to Lloyd's approval for its premium capacity each year.

Total Group Benefits Reserves as of December\u00a031, 2022 [1]  [1]Includes short duration contract reserves of $134 for short-term disability and $42 of supplemental health as well as reserves for future policy benefits that include $267 of paid up life reserves and policy reserves on life policies,$94 of reserves for conversions to individual life and $19 of other reserves. Group Benefits reserves include unpaid loss and loss adjustments expenses for long-term disability, group life and other lines of business as well as reserves for other policyholder funds and reserves for future policy benefits. Other policyholder funds and benefits payable represent deposits from policyholders, including policyholders of short-duration insurance contracts, where the Company does not have insurance risk but is subject to investment risk. Reserves for future policy benefits represent life-contingent reserves for which the Company is subject to insurance and investment risk.

UNDERWRITING FOR P&C AND GROUP BENEFITS The Company underwrites the risks it insures in order to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification. Risk modeling is used to manage, within specified limits, the aggregate exposure taken in each line of business and across the Company. For property and casualty business, aggregate exposure limits are set by geographic zone   and peril. Products are priced according to the risk characteristics of the insured\u2019s exposures. Rates charged for Personal Lines products are filed with the states in which we write business. Rates for most Commercial Lines products are also filed with the states but the premium charged may be modified based on the insured\u2019s relative risk profile and workers\u2019 compensation policies may be subject to modification based on prior loss experience. The Company also writes coverage in the excess and surplus lines market, primarily within global specialty, which is characterized by the absence of regulation related to rate and form and allows for more pricing and coverage flexibility to write certain classes of business. Pricing for Group Benefits products, including long-term disability and life insurance, is also based on an underwriting of the risks and a projection of estimated losses, including consideration of investment income.Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company\u2019s response to rate actions taken by competitors, its expense levels and expectations about regulatory and legal developments. The Company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments and the Lloyd's Syndicate's ability to write business is subject to Lloyd's approval for its premium capacity each year.

We are committed to ethical conduct and a bias-free workplace for all employees as we continue building, enhancing and sustaining an inclusive supportive culture that reflects the diversity of our customer base.We take a whole-company approach to ensure we meet our stated DEI goals. We hold our leaders accountable for making progress against our DEI goals. To that end, the Company requires each business and functional area, in partnership with our Human Resources team, to create and adopt individualized DEI plans with specific DEI goals. Leaders meet with the CEO twice a year to review progress against those goals and final results are then considered as part of the annual performance assessment process. We continue to invest in and accelerate a wide range of strategies to improve representation of talent that\u2019s demographically underrepresented in the insurance industry, including targeted initiatives to improve the representation of women and people of color. One of the ways we do this is by working to mitigate bias in our Human Resource systems and offering programs to educate employees on minimizing unconscious bias in the workplace. We have nine Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERG\u2019s\u201d) that are voluntary participation groups led by employees, dedicated to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. These groups focus on the development and success of the Company\u2019s employees through education, networking, mentorship and community volunteer opportunities. As of December 31, 2022, over 55% of employees were members of at least one ERG. In 2022, over 3,600 unique participants engaged in Courageous Conversations, a program to allow employees to respectfully exchange perspectives, that ultimately contributes to a more inclusive workplace. Additionally, one of our enterprise leadership programs, the \"Empower\" program, is designed to accelerate the readiness and encourage sponsorship of high performing, high potential people of color. The Company has demonstrated its commitment to DEI progress through its active involvement in organizations such as the CEO Action for Racial Equity and Catalyst CEO Champions for Change and has been recognized for its commitment to inclusive workplaces by a number of organizations. As of December 31, 2022, women and people of color represent 61.7% and 31.6% of our workforce, respectively. The Board of Directors is updated annually on the Company\u2019s DEI efforts.Our 2021 performance share awards under the Company\u2019s long-term incentive plan included a performance share modifier tied to the Company's workforce representation goals. The modifier will determine whether an increase or decrease of 10% on the pay-out for these awards is warranted based upon performance against predetermined year-end 2023 representation goals for women and people of color in executive level roles. This change was described in greater detail in our 2022 proxy statement. We currently expect that the 2024 and 2027 performance share awards will include a similar modifier to encourage continued progress toward the Company's 2030 representation goals.For more information on the Company\u2019s human capital including our commitments, goals, initiatives and progress, as well as our employee demographics, refer to The Hartford\u2019s Sustainability Highlight Report available on the investor relations section of the Company\u2019s website at: https://ir.thehartford.com.
