Our oral, injectable, and respiratory delivery technologies, along with our state-of-the-art protein, plasmid, viral, and cell and gene therapy manufacturing capacity, address a wide and growing range of modalities and therapeutic and other categories across the biopharmaceutical, pharmaceutical, and consumer health industries. Through our extensive capabilities, growth-enabling capacity, and deep expertise in product development, regulatory compliance, and clinical trial and commercial supply, we can help our customers take products to market faster, including more than half of new drug products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) in the last decade. Our development and manufacturing platforms, our proven formulation, supply, and regulatory expertise, and our broad and deep development and manufacturing know-how enable our customers to advance and then bring to market more products and better treatments for patients and consumers. Our commitment to reliably supply our customers\u2019 and their patients\u2019 needs is the foundation for the value we provide; annually, we produce approximately 70 billion unit doses for nearly 8,000 customer prescription and consumer health products, or approximately 1 in every 26 unit doses of such products taken each year by patients and consumers around the world. We believe that, through our investments in state-of-the-art facilities and capacity expansion, including investments in facilities focused on new treatment modalities and other attractive market segments, our continuous improvement activities devoted to operational and quality excellence, the sales of existing and introduction of new customer products, and, in some cases, our innovation activities and patents, we will continue to attract premium opportunities and realize the growth potential from these areas.   We continue to focus on enhancing both our product and service offerings and our sales and marketing activities in order to grow the number of active commercial manufacturing and development programs for our customers. This sustains our extensive, long-duration relationships and long-term contracts with a broad and diverse range of industry-leading customers. In fiscal 2023, we conducted business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug and consumer health marketers and 82 of the top 100 biologics marketers, measured on a global basis. Selected key customers include Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Haleon, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, and Sarepta Therapeutics.   We have many long-standing relationships with our customers, particularly those with commercial products, as we provide support and reliable supply through each stage of a product's lifecycle. Our relationship with an innovator of a prescription pharmaceutical product will often last many years\u2014in several cases, two decades or more\u2014extending from pre-clinical development through more mature commercial stages of the product's life cycle. We serve customers requiring some combination of innovative product development, superior quality, state-of-the-art manufacturing, and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs. Our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with all aspects of our customers\u2019 final formulations and dose forms, and this generally results in the inclusion of our facilities as manufacturing and testing sites in our customers\u2019 prescription product regulatory filings. Both factors frequently translate to long-duration supply relationships at an individual product level.   We believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies, continuous innovations and improvements, consistent and reliable supply, geographic reach, and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of business and product solutions that can be customized to fit their individual needs. Today we employ more than 9,000 highly trained direct manufacturing associates, as well as more than 3,000 formulation, analytical development, and process scientists and technicians. Our customers can also benefit from more than 1,800 patents and patent applications in advanced delivery platforms, drug and biologics formulation, and manufacturing. The aim of our offerings is to reliably supply our customers' commercial needs and also allow them to bring more products to market faster and develop and market differentiated products that improve patient outcomes. We believe our leading market position and diversity of customers, offerings, regulatory categories, products, and geographies reduce our exposure to potential strategic and product shifts within our industries.   We provide a wide variety of proprietary and non-proprietary, differentiated technologies, products, and service offerings to our customers across our development and manufacturing platforms, which we have advanced and grown over more than 90 years through internal development, strategic alliances, in-licensing, and acquisitions. We initially introduced our softgel capsule technologies in the 1930s and have continuously expanded our range of offerings. In recent years, we have launched more than a dozen internally developed new technology platform offerings. We have also augmented our portfolio through acquisitions. Among the technologies we currently offer are softgel capsules, including both gelatin and non-gelatin formulations, our Zydis orally disintegrating tablets, gummy and soft chew oral forms, protein production using advanced mammalian cell lines, adeno-associated virus (\u201cAAV\u201d) and other viral vectors, induced pluripotent stem cells (\u201ciPSCs\u201d) and  7 7 7   other cell types, plasmid DNA (\u201cpDNA\u201d), and a range of other oral, injectable, and respiratory delivery technologies. The technologies and service offerings within our development solution platforms span the full drug development process, ranging from our OptiForm Solution Suite for enhancement of bioavailability and other characteristics of early-stage small molecules, Gene Product Expression (\u201cGPEx\u201d), GPEx Boost, and GPEx Lightning for advanced cell line development, pDNA development and manufacturing and SMARTag platforms for development of biologics and antibody-drug conjugates (\u201cADCs\u201d), to formulation, analytical, and bioanalytical services, early-stage clinical development, drug-device combination development and supply, fill and finish operations for injectable products, and clinical trials supply, including our unique FlexDirect direct-to-patient and FastChain demand-led clinical supply solutions. Our offerings serve a critical need in the development and manufacture of products across a broad range of product types. We focus on serving as an accelerator for new therapeutic modalities and formulation, delivery, and manufacturing technologies. Our expertise enables us to bring advanced products to market at scale, faster.  In large part due to acquisitions and investments, their subsequent organic growth, the revenue contribution from our Biologics segment has grown from approximately 17% in fiscal 2016 to 46% in fiscal 2023. We believe our own internal innovation and investments, supplemented by current and future external partnerships and acquisitions, will continue to extend our leadership positions in the development, reliable supply, and delivery of drugs, protein-based biologics, cell and gene therapies, and consumer health products. History  We trace our history to the 1933 founding of the R.P. Scherer Corporation, which developed the first rotary die machine for the manufacture of soft gelatin capsules, and we assumed our current form in April 2007. We regularly review our portfolio of offerings and operations in the context of our strategic growth plan, and, where appropriate, have added to or divested from our portfolio of offering and sites, which has led to significant growth of the overall business. In July 2014, we completed the initial public offering of our Common Stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) under the symbol \u201cCTLT.\u201d   We are a holding company that indirectly owns Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. (\u201cOperating Company\u201d), which owns, directly or indirectly, all of our operating assets.  Our Competitive Strengths   Available, State-of-the-art Manufacturing Capacity in Attractive Market Segments  We have invested several billion dollars over the last few years to broaden our portfolio of offerings and expand our capacity with state-of-the-art manufacturing and development capabilities that focus on anticipating and meeting the needs of the evolving biopharmaceutical, pharmaceutical, and consumer health industries. In addition, we have hired and trained thousands of new direct manufacturing associates in our quality-focused culture of operational excellence. The capacity and capabilities we have built and purchased, along with our continuing efforts to assure operational and quality excellence, have and will continue to enable us to secure attractive new business opportunities in the expanding market for outsourced product development and supply.   Vibrant, Patient First-Driven Culture  From the manufacturing line to the executive suite, for all our critical decisions, we ask the question, \u201cWhat would the impact be to the patient?\u201d, and our culture is built on our cornerstone value of Patient First. We believe this mindset, which aligns closely with our customers\u2019 values, enables a pervasive focus on patient safety, impact, and outcomes, and an uncompromising approach to product quality and compliance, by reminding us of those who depend upon our vigilance concerning the safety, quality, reliability, and sustainability of our product supply. Along with other key cultural strengths, including our commitments to diversity and inclusion and to science-based environmental sustainability, we believe our culture brings us both a unique reputation and an operating capability that is difficult to replicate.  Diversified Operating Platform   We are diversified by virtue of our broad range of product and service offerings, our geographic scope, our large customer portfolio, the extensive range of products we produce, and our ability to provide solutions at every stage of a product\u2019s lifecycle. In fiscal 2023, we produced nearly 8,000 distinct products across multiple categories. Our fiscal 2023 net revenue was distributed by relevant product regulatory/marketing status as follows: biologics 51%, branded drugs 30%, generic prescription drugs 2%, over-the-counter drugs 7%, and consumer health and other 10% combined. In fiscal 2023, our top 20  8 8 8   products represented 37% of our total net revenue, with one customer accounting for approximately 10% of net revenue whose largest individual product accounted for approximately 9% of our net revenue. We serve more than 1,200 customers in more than 80 countries, with 35% of our fiscal 2023 net revenue coming from outside the U.S. This diversity, combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships, has contributed to the long-term stability of our business. It has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to the risks associated with potential strategic, customer, and product shifts as well as to payer-driven pricing pressures experienced by our drug and biologic customers.   Longstanding, Extensive Relationships with a Diverse Customer Portfolio  We have longstanding, extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health customers. In fiscal 2023, we did business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug and consumer health marketers and 82 of the top 100 biologics marketers, measured on a global basis, as well as with more than 1,200 other customers, including emerging and specialty biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business models. Regardless of size, our customers seek innovative product development, superior quality, advanced manufacturing, and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs.  We believe our customers value us because our broad range of product and service offerings, recently expanded capacity in state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, including facilities offering new treatment modalities, reliable supply, geographic reach, commitment to operational and quality excellence, and substantial expertise that enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions, many of which are unavailable from other individual providers. Deep, Broad, and Growing Advanced Technology Foundation  Our breadth of offerings employing advanced technologies and state-of-the-art manufacturing systems and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants. Our leading softgel platforms, including Liqui-Gels, OptiShell, OptiGel DR, and Vegicaps capsules, our gummy and soft chew oral forms, and our modified release technologies, including the Zydis family of orally disintegrating tablets, our spray drying capabilities, and our OptiPact and OptiMelt technologies, provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers. We offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via oral, respiratory, and injectable routes and also provide advanced biologics formulation options, including GPEx, GPEx Boost, and GPEx Lightning mammalian cell lines for protein production, SMARTag ADC technology, AAV vectors for cell and gene therapies, iPSC development and manufacturing, and pDNA development and manufacturing. We have a leadership position within respiratory delivery, including dry powder inhalers and intra-nasal forms. We have reinforced our leadership position in advanced technologies over the last three years, as we have launched more than a dozen new technology platforms and applications, and recently purchased or expanded our businesses developing and manufacturing consumer health products, protein-based biologics, fill and finish for injectable drugs and biologics, cell and gene therapies, and other new therapeutic modalities. Our culture of creativity, problem-solving, and innovation is grounded in our advanced technologies, the substantial expertise and experience of our scientists and engineers, and, in some cases, our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes. Our global product development and innovation teams drive a focused application of resources to opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development. As of June\u00a030, 2023, we had more than 1,500 product development programs in active development across our businesses.  Long-Duration Relationships Provide Sustainability   Our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers\u2019 molecules to yield safe and effective final formulations and dose forms, and this generally results in the inclusion of Catalent in our customers\u2019 prescription product regulatory filings. Both factors translate to long-duration supply relationships at an individual product level, to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce long-duration commercial supply agreements. These agreements typically have initial terms of two to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years (see \u201c\u2014Contractual Arrangements\u201d for more detail). Approximately three-quarters of our fiscal 2023 net revenue from our product development and delivery offerings and related services were covered by such long-term contractual arrangements. We believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage.  Significant Recent Growth Investments   We have made over time, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in our manufacturing network, which is capable of serving customers and patients worldwide, and today employ approximately 8 million square feet of manufacturing, laboratory, and related space across four continents. We have deployed approximately $2.61 billion in the last five fiscal years in gross capital expenditures, not including approximately $3.58 billion spent acquiring new facilities and businesses. Growth-related investments in facilities, capacity, and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas  9 9 9   aligned with anticipated future demand, including in pDNA, cell and gene therapies, fill and finish for injectable drugs and biologics, and other new therapeutic modalities. Through our continuing commitment to operational, quality, and regulatory excellence, we drive continuous improvements in safety, productivity, sustainability and reliable supply, which we believe further differentiates us. Our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality, delivery, sustainability, and regulatory compliance expectations.   High Standards of Regulatory Compliance and Operational and Quality Excellence   We operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) or other applicable requirements, following our own high standards that are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. We have approximately 1,900 employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance. All of our facilities are registered where required with the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency (the \u201cEMA\u201d). In many cases, our facilities are registered with multiple food, drug, or biologics regulatory agencies around the world. In fiscal 2023, we were subject to 58 regulatory audits, and, over the last five fiscal years, we successfully completed approximately 300 regulatory audits. We also undergo more than 700 customer and internal audits annually. We believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a favorable competitive differentiator.  Strong and Experienced Management Team   Our executive leadership team collectively has approximately 550 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. With an average of approximately 28 years of functional experience, this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships.   Our Strategy   Our strategic ambition, guided by and operationalized through our values, is to power the innovation and growth of the life science industry by becoming its leading development and commercial partner in reliable supply, conventional and advanced technologies, first-to-scale innovation, and therapeutic modalities, and integrated solutions. To achieve this, we continue to pursue the following key growth initiatives: Capabilities & Capacity \u2014 Continued Expansion in Biologics and Other Attractive Markets   Recognizing the strategic importance of protein-based biologics, cell and gene therapies, pDNA, and other new biopharmaceutical modalities, we began to build a differentiated biologics platform in 2002. Since 2019, we have invested over $3.42 billion in our biologics business, including capital investments and approximately $1.83 billion for acquisitions of biologics-focused businesses and sites. Today, we are a recognized leader in biologics, including AAV vectors for gene therapies; development and supply for cell therapies; advanced cell-line development; formulation and fill-finish into vials, pre-filled syringes, and cartridges; specialized manufacturing of biologic drug substances; and bioanalytical analysis. We have partnered with customers from around the world to develop advanced cell expression for more than 1,100 cell lines, many using our advanced GPEx, GPEx Boost, and GPEx Lightning technologies, and have actively collaborated on developing and scaling up more than 125 cell and gene therapies. In the recent fiscal years, we expanded our existing cell therapy development and manufacturing capabilities, began offering pDNA production services, and acquired several facilities including a commercial-scale cell therapy manufacturing facility in Princeton, New Jersey (\u201cPrinceton\u201d) and a developer and manufacturer of iPSCs located near Dusseldorf, Germany. We have also invested in a second-generation ADC technology, SMARTag, and see continued progress in this technology\u2019s capabilities and our customers\u2019 SMARTag product-development activities.  In addition to our expansion in biologics, we have invested additional capital in our facilities in order to expand in attractive markets, including significant expansion of our oral solid controlled release production capacity in Winchester, Kentucky, and the addition of specialized capabilities and capacity in early development. We acquired a leading position in consumer-preferred gummy and soft-chew formats for consumer health products with our acquisition of Bettera Holdings, LLC (\u201cBettera Wellness\u201d) in fiscal 2022. We expanded our capacity for oral and injectable products via our fiscal 2020 acquisition of a facility in Anagni, Italy, and our capacity for spray dried dispersion and dry powder inhaler manufacturing via our fiscal 2021 acquisition of a facility located near Boston, Massachusetts.  Use Our Proprietary Technologies and Substantial Expertise to Help Our Customers Develop New Products We have broad and diverse technology platforms that are supported by deep scientific and technical expertise, extensive know-how, and more than 1,800 patents and patent applications in approximately 170 families across advanced delivery platforms, drug and biologics formulation, and manufacturing. For example, we have significant softgel fill and formulation know-how, databases of formulated products, and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise. As a result, nearly 90% of  10 10 10   approvals by the FDA over the last 25 years of new chemical entities presented in a softgel format have been developed and supplied by us.   In addition to resolving delivery challenges for our customers\u2019 products, we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proof-of-concept products, whether improved versions of existing drugs, new generic formulations, or innovative consumer health products. In the consumer health area, we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for self-created products, which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business. We expect to continue to seek proactive development opportunities and other non-traditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms. These activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of end-market value through out-licensing, profit-sharing, and other arrangements.  Operational Leverage \u2014 Deploy Existing Infrastructure and Operational Discipline to Drive Profitable Growth  Through our existing infrastructure, including our global network of operating locations and programs, we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion. With our active focus on continuous improvement and sustainability enhancement, global procurement function, and conversion cost productivity metrics in place, we continuously seek to enhance our culture of functional excellence and cost accountability. Along with the ongoing increase in the share of revenues from higher margin biologics offerings, we expect this discipline to further leverage our operational network for profitable growth.  Strategic Acquisitions and Licensing \u2014 Build on our Existing Platform  We operate in the markets for outsourced development solutions and commercial supply, generally provided by contract development and manufacturing organizations (\u201cCDMO\u201d), where we estimate current industry spending at more than $70 billion globally. Our broad platform, global infrastructure, and diversified customer portfolio provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets, to enter new markets, and generate operating leverage through acquisitions. Since fiscal 2013, we have executed 22 transactions, investing approximately $4.91 billion, and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions.  While we are rigorously focused on driving our organic growth, we have in recent years substantially increased our participation in biologics, including protein-based biologics, cell and gene therapies, pDNA development and production, and drug product fill and finish, via strategy-driven inorganic transactions. We intend to identify and execute strategic transactions to optimize our portfolio of offerings and businesses, within the context of our long-term capital allocation strategy. We have a dedicated corporate development team in place to pursue these transactions, enabled by a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating and executing these transactions.  \u201cFollow the Molecule\u201d\u00ae by Providing Solutions to our Customers across all Phases of the Product Lifecycle  We intend to continue to use our development and manufacturing solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers\u2019 products to drive future growth. Our development solutions span the drug development process, starting with our platforms for early pre-clinical development of small molecules, protein-based biologics, and cell and gene therapies; through formulation and analytical services, development and manufacturing of clinical trial supplies, and fill and finish of injectable products; to regulatory consulting. Once a molecule is ready for clinical trials and subsequent commercialization, we provide our customers with a range of advanced technologies and expert, state-of-the-art manufacturing solutions that allow them to deliver their molecules to the end-users in safe, effective, and, in some cases, patient-preferred dosage forms, to produce biologic drug substances needed for protein-based biologics and cell and gene therapies, and to provide primary and secondary packaging solutions and cold-storage distribution services. Our relationship with a molecule typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product and can extend throughout the molecule\u2019s commercial life. For prescription products, we are often the sole or primary outsourced provider and are frequently reflected in customers\u2019 product approval applications. Our revenue from our development and manufacturing activities are primarily driven by volumes, and, as a result, the loss of an innovator drug\u2019s market exclusivity may be mitigated if we supply customers offering generic or biosimilar equivalents.   An example of the long and mutually productive relationships we foster can be found in a leading over-the-counter anti-allergy brand, which today uses both our proprietary Zydis orally disintegrating tablets and Liqui-Gels softgel technology. We originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient sub-segment needs. After four years of development, we then commercially supplied the prescription product in our Zydis format for six years, and we have continued to provide the Zydis form since the switch to over-the-counter status in the U.S. and other markets in the early 2000s. Subsequently, we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer, which the customer elected to develop and launch as well. By following this molecule, we have built a strong, 3 decade-long relationship across multiple formats and markets.  11 11 11   Customer Product Pipeline \u2014 Continuing to Grow Through New Projects and Product Launches  We intend to continue to supplement our existing diverse base of commercialized customer products with new development programs. As of June 30, 2023, our product development teams were working on more than 1,500 customer development programs in active development across our business. Our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand, as well as from our expanded capabilities and technology platforms. Although there are many complex factors that affect the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical, protein-based biologic, cell and gene therapy, and consumer health products, we expect that a portion of these programs will reach full development and market approval in the future and thereby add to our long-duration commercial revenues under long-term contracts and grow our existing product base. In fiscal 2023, we introduced 216 new products for our customers.   Catalent continues to be a leader in providing chemistry, manufacturing, and controls-based product development services to the global pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health industries, driven by thousands of projects annually. In fiscal 2023, we recognized $1.95 billion of net revenue related to the development of products, down 16% from the prior year, principally driven by the substantial decrease in net revenue from the development of COVID-19 related products. In addition, substantially all of the revenue associated with the Clinical Supply Services business relates to our support of customer products in development.  Our Reportable Segments  At the beginning of fiscal 2023, in connection with the appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as the Company\u2019s Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Company changed its operating structure and reorganized its executive leadership team. This new organizational structure includes operating and reporting in two segments: (i) Biologics and (ii) Pharma and Consumer Health.   Biologics  Our Biologics segment provides formulation, development, and manufacturing for biologic proteins, cell gene, and other nucleic acid therapies; pDNA, iPSCs, oncolytic viruses, and vaccines; formulation, development, and manufacturing for parenteral dose forms, including vials, prefilled syringes, and cartridges; and analytical development and testing services for large molecules.

In fiscal 2022, we acquired a fully operational, commercial-scale cell therapy campus in Princeton with 16 suites available for both autologous and allogeneic clinical and commercial manufacturing. The Princeton campus works in conjunction with our Gosselies, Belgium cell therapy center of excellence and our iPSC manufacturing center of excellence in Dusseldorf, Germany, to support our customers\u2019 global cell therapy needs. Additionally, we have expanded our gene therapy flagship manufacturing campus in Harmans, Maryland, creating a total of 18 penthouse-style viral-vector suites, and added our Virtuoso AAV platform that reduces AAV development time by half, enabling our customers to reach first-in-human studies faster. Our specialized expertise in AAV vectors, the most commonly used delivery system for gene therapies, and iPSCs for next-generation allogeneic cell therapy manufacturing, together with our substantial global cell therapy manufacturing, capacity for clinical- through commercial-scale batches, and our capabilities in mRNA and pDNA manufacturing, position us to capitalize on strong industry demand and expansions in the use of newer modalities in the cell and gene therapy market.  12 12 12   Our range of injectable manufacturing offerings includes manufacturing drug substances and filling small molecules or biologics into vials, syringes, and cartridges, with flexibility to accommodate other formats within our existing network. In addition to primary packaging, our network provides secondary packaging capabilities, including auto-injector and safety device assembly for commercial launch and life-cycle management. Our clinical supply services business provides a global network for clinical distribution, as well as labeling, packaging, and cold-chain storage for clinical trials and commercial supply of biotherapeutics and cell and gene therapies. Our fill and finish services are largely focused on complex pharmaceuticals and biologics. With our range of technologies, we are able to meet a wide range of specifications, timelines, and budgets. We believe that the complexity of the manufacturing process, the importance of experience and know-how, a proven history of regulatory compliance, and substantial state-of-the-art capacity provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage in the market.   We also offer analytical development and testing services for proteins, gene and cell therapies, and other biologic modalities, including bioassay, biophysical characterization, and cGMP release and stability testing. Our OneBio Suite provides customers with the potential to seamlessly integrate drug substance, drug product, and clinical supply management for products in development, and for integrated commercial supply across both drug substance and drug product. We provide a broad range of technologies and services supporting the development and launch of new biologic entities, biosimilars, biobetters, and cell and gene therapies to bring a product from gene to commercialization, faster.

We provide fluid bed coating, spray drying, hot melt extrusion, micronization, and lipid formulation capabilities, all of which are used to enhance a drug\u2019s administration and release profile and its clinical performance. We offer comprehensive analytical method development and scientific capabilities, including stability testing and global regulatory services to support both fully integrated development programs or standalone fee-for-service work. We have a network of early development sites focused on earlier phase compounds (i.e., pre-clinical and Phase I) to engage with more customer molecules earlier in their development, with the intent to also support these molecules downstream as they progress towards commercial approval and supply. Demand for our offerings is driven by the need for scientific expertise, the depth and breadth of integrated services offered, as well as the reliability of our supply performance across quality and operational parameters.   Manufacturing  Our large-scale cGMP pharmaceutical manufacturing solutions typically include clinical trial supplies, registration batches, and commercial production across a broad range of formats, and may also involve finished dose packaging or advanced processing of intermediates to achieve the desired clinical performance of the prescription or over-the-counter pharmaceutical product. Finished dose forms include softgel capsules, our Zydis fast-dissolve tablets, and traditional and advanced complex oral solid-doses, including coated and uncoated tablets, pellet/bead/powder-filled two-piece hard capsules, granulated powders, and other immediate and modified release forms. Advanced intermediate processing may include coating, extrusion, or spheronization to achieve specific functional outcomes, including site- or time-specific drug release, taste  13 13 13   masking, or enhanced bioavailability. We have deep experience at managing complex technical transfers of clinical or commercial programs, whether from Catalent\u2019s early development network, other contract development sites, or from customers directly.  Softgel technology platform  We provide formulation, development, and manufacturing services for soft capsules, or \u201csoftgels,\u201d as well as large-scale manufacturing of oral solid dose forms for pharmaceutical and consumer health markets, along with supporting ancillary services.

We are the market leader in overall softgel development and manufacturing and hold the leading market position in innovator drug softgels. Our principal softgel technologies include traditional softgel capsules, in which the shell is made of animal-derived gelatin, and Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules, in which the shell is made from plant-derived materials. Softgel capsules are used in a broad range of customer products, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, unit-dose cosmetics, and animal health medicinal preparations. Softgel capsules encapsulate liquid, paste, or oil-based formulations of active compounds in solution or suspension within an outer shell. In the manufacturing process, the capsules are formed, filled, and sealed simultaneously. We typically perform encapsulation for a product within one of our softgel facilities, with active ingredients provided by customers or sourced directly by us. Softgels have historically been used to solve formulation challenges or technical issues for a specific drug, to help improve the clinical performance of compounds, to provide important market differentiation, particularly for over-the-counter medications, and to provide safe handling of hormonal, highly potent, and cytotoxic drugs. We also participate in the softgel vitamin, mineral, and supplement business in selected regions around the world. Our plant-derived softgel shells, available as Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules, allow innovators and consumer health customers to extend the softgel dose form to a broader range of active ingredients and serve patient and consumer populations that were previously inaccessible due to religious, dietary, or cultural preferences. Our Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules are protected by patents in most major global markets. Physician and patient studies we have conducted have demonstrated a preference for softgels versus traditional tablet and hard capsule dose forms in terms of ease of swallowing, real or perceived speed of delivery, ability to remove or eliminate unpleasant odor or taste, and, for physicians, perceived improved patient adherence with dosing regimens.   In addition to softgel capsules, following our fiscal 2022 acquisition of Bettera Wellness, we also conduct formulation, development, and manufacturing of gummies, soft chews, and lozenges in a variety of sizes and shapes serving the dietary supplements market at three facilities in the United States. We use dietary and food ingredients provided by our customers or sourced directly by us, and we also provide ancillary services such as analytical testing and packaging.  Clinical Supply Services   Our Pharma and Consumer Health segment also provides clinical supply services through manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, and inventory management for small-molecule drugs, protein-based biologics, and cell and gene therapies in clinical trials. We offer customers flexible solutions for clinical supplies production and provide distribution and inventory management support for both simple and complex clinical trials. This includes over-encapsulation where needed; supplying placebos, comparator drug procurement, and clinical packages and kits for physicians and patients; inventory management; investigator kit ordering and fulfillment; cold-chain storage and distribution; and return supply reconciliation and reporting. We support trials in all regions of the world through our facilities and distribution network. In recent years, we have extended our network, with significant expansions at our Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Shanghai, China free trade zone locations and facilities in California, China, and Japan. We also continue to develop new solutions for the evolving clinical trial environment, including FlexDirect direct-to-patient, CT Success clinical supply planning, and extensive cold-chain investments. We are the leading provider of integrated development solutions and one of the leading providers of clinical trial supplies.   We have partnered with companies who focus on the development of cannabis-based prescription medicines and high-value cannabinoid drug therapies whose goal is to achieve full regulatory approval under the strictest legal standards in effect in any jurisdiction affected, including cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol pharmaceutical products using our Zydis technology in clinical trials across a range of indications, including multiple sclerosis spasticity, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, chronic pain for cancer, and epilepsy. Our total net revenue related to such development programs was less than 1% of total revenue generated in fiscal 2023. We do not provide any services for or otherwise partner with any company that does not comply with all applicable laws, including the U.S. federal controlled substances laws (or non-U.S. equivalent laws), relating to cannabis products.  14 14 14    Integrated Development and Product Supply Chain Solutions  In addition to our proprietary offerings, we are also differentiated in the market by our ability to bring together our development solutions and state-of-the-art product manufacturing to offer integrated development and product supply solutions that can be combined or tailored in many ways to enable our customers to take their drugs, biologics, and consumer health products from laboratory to market, faster. Once a product is on the market, we can provide comprehensive, integrated product supply, from the sourcing or supply of the bulk active ingredient to comprehensive manufacturing and packaging, to the testing required for release, and to cold-chain or ambient temperature distribution. The customer- and product-specific solutions we develop are flexible, scalable, and creative, so that they meet the unique needs of both large and emerging biopharmaceutical, pharmaceutical, and consumer health companies and are appropriate for products of all sizes. We believe that our development and product supply solutions, such as OptiForm Solution Suite and OneBio Suite, will continue to contribute to our future growth.   Sales and Marketing  Our target customers include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, mid-size, emerging, and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and consumer health companies, along with companies in other selected healthcare market segments such as animal health and medical devices, and companies in adjacent industries, such as cosmetics. We have longstanding, extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health customers. In fiscal 2023, we did business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug and consumer health marketers and 82 of the top 100 biologics marketers, measured on a global basis, as well as with more than 1,200 other customers. Faced with access, pricing, and reimbursement pressures as well as other market challenges, large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have increasingly sought partners to enhance the clinical competitiveness of their drugs and biologics and improve the productivity of their research and development activities, while reducing their fixed cost bases. Many mid-size, emerging, and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, while facing the same pricing and market pressures, have chosen not to build a full infrastructure, but rather to partner with other companies through licensing agreements or outsourcing to access the critical skills, technologies, and services required to bring their products to market. Consumer health companies require rapidly developed, innovative dose forms and formulations to keep up with the fast-paced over-the-counter medication, dietary supplement, and personal care markets. These market segments are all important to our growth, but require distinct solutions, marketing and sales approaches, and market strategy.   We follow a hybrid demand-generation organization model, with strategic account teams offering the full breadth of Catalent\u2019s solutions, and technical specialist teams providing the in-depth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering, both supported by a dedicated team of deeply experienced scientific advisors. Our sales organization currently consists of more than 200 full-time, experienced sales professionals, supported by inside sales and sales operations. We also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team, providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings. As part of our marketing efforts, we participate in major trade shows relevant to our offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive advertising and publicity program. We believe that Catalent is a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and universe of target customers, and that our brand identity is a competitive advantage for us. Global Accounts  We manage select accounts globally due to their substantial current business or growth potential. We recorded approximately one-third of our total net revenue in fiscal 2023 from these global accounts. Each global account is assigned a lead business development professional with substantial industry experience. These account leaders, along with other members of the sales and executive leadership teams, are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship. Account leaders work closely with the rest of the sales organization as well as operational, quality, and project management personnel to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts.   Emerging, Specialty, and Virtual Accounts   Emerging, specialty, and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally and account for more than three-quarters of the active drug and biologic development pipeline. Historically, many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure, but rather partner with other companies to formulate, develop, analyze, test, and manufacture their products. We expect them to continue to do so in the future, providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand. We expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in North America, Europe, Central and South America, and Asia. We regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles, funding status, and relationships, to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions  15 15 15   designed to address the specific needs of these customers. In order to reach these emerging, specialty, and virtual companies, we actively partner with leading venture capital investors and biotech incubators.  Seasonality; Fluctuations in Operation Results  Our annual financial reporting period ends on June 30. As discussed further in \u201cItem 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Factors Affecting our Performance,\u201d our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year, with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter, and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue. These fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our, and our customers\u2019 annual operational maintenance periods at locations in the U.S. and Europe, the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions, clinical trial and research and development schedules, the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration, and, to a lesser extent, the time of the year some of our customers\u2019 products are in higher demand, or are being produced to support future seasonal demand.  Contractual Arrangements  We generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers, including agreements with respect to feasibility, development, supply, licenses, quality, and confidentiality. The terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the offering and customer requirements. Some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements, such as fee-for-service, unit pricing in one or more tiers, minimum volume commitments, royalties, manufacturing preparation services, profit-sharing, and fixed fees. We generally secure pricing and other contract mechanisms in our supply agreements to allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms, and, in some cases, these agreements permit us to raise or renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials or other inputs we use to make products. Our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities, subject in each case to negotiated exclusions. The terms of our manufacturing supply agreements range from two to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years, although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods, such as 30 or 45 days. For our development solutions offerings, we may enter into master service agreements, which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings.   Backlog   While we generally have long-term supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years, our backlog represents, as of a point in time, future service revenues from work not yet completed. For our Biologics segment and a majority of our Pharma and Consumer Health segment, backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes, where applicable. Manufacturing businesses backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes, where applicable. For the clinical supply services offered through our Pharma and Consumer Health segment, backlog represents estimated future service revenue from work not yet completed under signed contracts. Using these methods of reporting backlog, as of June\u00a030, 2023, our backlog was $2.53 billion, compared to $2.85 billion as of June\u00a030, 2022, including $557 million and $549 million, respectively, related to our scientific and clinical services offerings in our Pharma and Consumer Health segment. We expect to recognize as revenue by the end of fiscal 2024 approximately 83% of the value of the backlog in existence as of June 30, 2023.  To the extent projects are delayed, the timing of our revenue could be affected. If a customer cancels an order, we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. For orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period or that involve minimum volume commitments, we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation. Fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers, which often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand. Because of customer ordering patterns, the matters discussed in this paragraph, and other factors, our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results.   Manufacturing Capabilities  We operate manufacturing facilities, development centers, and sales offices throughout the world. As of June\u00a030, 2023, we had 52 facilities (3 geographical locations operate as multiple facilities because they support more than one reporting segment, with one location including both a manufacturing facility and our corporate headquarters) on four continents with approximately 8 million square feet of manufacturing, laboratory, office, and related space. Our manufacturing capabilities generally include the full suite of competencies relevant to the support of each site\u2019s activities, including regulatory, quality assurance, and in-house validation. 16 16 16   We operate our manufacturing facilities and development centers in accordance with cGMP or other applicable requirements. All of these sites are registered where required with the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies, such as the EMA. In some cases, our sites are registered with multiple regulatory agencies.  We have invested $1.93 billion in our manufacturing and development facilities since fiscal 2021 for improvements and expansions, including $583 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2023. We believe that our sites and equipment are in good condition, are well maintained, and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future, in all material respects.  Our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety, regulatory compliance, operational excellence, continuous improvement, and process standardization across the organization. In fiscal 2023, we achieved approximately 95% on-time shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus. Our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs, including Lean Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing, which we brought together in a system that we refer to as \u201cThe Catalent Way.\u201d   Raw Materials  We use a broad and diverse range of raw materials and other supplies in the design, development, and manufacture of our products. This includes, but is not limited to, key materials such as gelatin, starch, and iota carrageenan; packaging films; single-use production components for drug substance production, and glass vials and syringes for drug product. The raw materials and other supplies that we use are sourced externally on a global basis. Globally, our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions, including those caused by pandemics or geopolitical and other issues. For example, commercially usable gelatin is available from a limited number of sources. In addition, much of the gelatin we use is bovine-derived. Past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin. If there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin or any other key material from any one or more of our current principal suppliers, there can be no assurance that we could obtain an adequate alternative supply from our other suppliers. Any future restriction that were to emerge on the use of a key raw material used in our products from certain geographic sources or due to regulatory or consumer concerns could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products, and the use of alternative raw materials could be subject to lengthy formulation, testing and regulatory approval periods.   We work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability. We continually evaluate alternate sources of supply, although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships, the reliability of our current supplier base, and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process, since regulators usually must approve changes to prescription product ingredient sources. Although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin, we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business. See \u201cItem 1A. - Risk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate\u2014Our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs, availability, and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, purchased components, and raw materials, and other supplies or equipment we need to run our business.\"   Competition   We compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate, including with CDMOs and other companies that offer conventional and advanced technologies for the development, supply, and delivery of medicinal products, clinical trials support, outsourced dose form, protein-based biologics or cell or gene therapy manufacturing, or development services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health companies based in North America, Central and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. We also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally. Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have access to more substantial resources, which could be deployed to expand their range of offerings or capacity.  Competition is driven by proprietary technologies and know-how (where relevant), capabilities, consistency of operational performance, availability of equipment, quality, regulatory track record, price, value, responsiveness, and speed. While we have competitors that compete with us in our individual offerings, and a few competitors that compete across many of our offerings, we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable company.  17 17 17   Research and Development Costs Our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements. Research and development costs amounted to $18\u00a0million, $23\u00a0million, and $21\u00a0million for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.   Employees  As of June\u00a030, 2023, we had approximately 17,800\u00a0individuals providing services for us at 52 facilities on 4 continents, of which certain employees at two of our 24 U.S. facilities are represented by labor unions, with their terms and conditions of employment being subject to collective bargaining agreements. Various combinations of national works councils, labor unions, and other labor organizations are active at all of our European and many of our other ex-U.S. facilities consistent with labor environments and laws in those countries. Our management believes that our relations with our workforce are satisfactory. Most of our individual service providers are full-time employees, while approximately 700 of our workers as of June 30, 2023 are contingent workers who are either self-employed or employed by external services organizations.  North AmericaEuropeSouth AmericaAsia PacificTotalApproximate number of workers as of June 30, 202310,5005,7001,00060017,800  Human Capital Management  Our employees share common goals: to put patients first and to help people around the world live better, healthier lives. Our global workforce is united by our values: Patient First, commitment to our people, customer dedication, innovation, integrity, and excellence. Together, our values provide the foundation for our culture. We believe that an engaged, diverse workforce, empowered by inclusive leaders, will unlock our full potential as a company and as a leader in our sector. Our employees\u2019 success is Catalent\u2019s success.  We focus on employee development, engagement, and diversity and inclusion (\u201cD&I\u201d) to hire, develop, and retain the best talent. As of June 30, 2023, we had approximately 17,800 individuals providing services to us globally, with women representing 44% of our employees and holding 40% of roles at the manager level or higher. In fiscal 2023, ethnically diverse talent represented 35% of our U.S. employees.  Our turnover rate increased to 22% as of June 30, 2023, including 13% voluntary turnover, substantially driven by voluntary turnover in the U.S. and by a few reorganizations at some of our larger sites and within our corporate functions.  Reducing voluntary attrition and retaining our talent remains one of our top priorities. We continue to implement initiatives to build upon our values-based and inclusive culture, improve our employees\u2019 experiences at Catalent, and better develop and engage internal talent. We continuously monitor local talent markets and provide differentiated pay arrangements and benefits to attract and retain talent. Additionally, we provide flexible work arrangements where possible, broader leadership development programs, an employee wellness program, and access to employee recognition programs at all levels.    We continue to take steps to ensure that Catalent is a company where all employees can develop a fulfilling career with support from our leadership team. We believe that our diverse pool of internal talent and our employees\u2019 passion for excellence make a difference in the way we grow and deliver results.   Talent Acquisition  We have strong human resources processes and practices in place to support our employees through their careers at Catalent. This starts with a robust recruiting strategy and a strong employer brand. We attracted over 4,000 new employees in fiscal 2023, continuously working to reduce the time it takes to fill open positions and reduce our cost per hire, while striving for a best-in-class candidate experience.  We offer competitive compensation and a comprehensive suite of benefits, which, in the U.S., range from medical, dental, and vision coverage to retirement, disability, employee stock purchase, and life insurance programs. We also provide health promotion and wellness programs, remote work flexibility, tuition assistance, and employee assistance programs in several countries.   18 18 18   Our recruitment strategy aims to attract talent representing diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and ideas. This approach includes:  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0engaging with potential top talent early in the career path through our university internship program; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0developing future leaders and enhancing their skills through programs, including various mentoring programs, our Global Organization Leadership Development (\u201cGOLD\u201d), Next Generation Global Leaders, and General Manager Excellence programs, as discussed further below; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0providing competitive compensation and benefits; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0continuously improving recruitment processes and platforms;  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0working with several recruitment partners to attract diverse profiles and advertise open positions; and \u2022implementing unconscious bias workshops for hiring managers.  Catalent has been recognized as a TOP EMPLOYER USA since 2020 and as a TOP EMPLOYER in the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\") since 2022. We differentiate ourselves as a preferred employer to candidates through our reputation as a great place to work, offering a fast-paced and rewarding work environment.  Talent Development  We are also committed to the growth, development, and engagement of our people once they have joined our family. Through a strong learning and development culture, we provide opportunities for specialized technical training, leadership development, and high-potential growth opportunities to endow our employees with the knowledge and expertise needed to grow their careers at Catalent.    Our primary goal is to develop our people from within, thereby establishing a strong successor bench to help support company growth. In fiscal 2023, over 2,400 employees moved to a new role within the organization (of which 49% were women), whether as a developmental move or a promotion to a more senior position. Our senior leaders are committed to talent development and dedicate time each fiscal quarter to perform formalized talent reviews to discuss the development of key talent and to update succession plans for critical roles.  We strongly believe that the combination of experience (70%), exposure (20%), and education (10%) is the best recipe for personal development and career progression here. We have a library of tools and resources available for our employees within that framework, including access to a variety of tools and resources to learn new or expand existing skills.  Given our high volume of new hires, we continue to redesign our employee experience. We have upgraded our on-boarding experience to span employees\u2019 first twelve months with Catalent.   We also offer four formal development programs to employees. All programs aim to prepare our talent to fill critical internal leadership roles. Through these programs, we have created a bench of leaders who model our values and are ready to take on more responsibility.    (1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Entry-level GOLD program. The GOLD program is a two-year rotational program for recent graduates from universities around the world in which the employee participates in three rotations at different sites in our network to learn about different aspects of our business and our varied offerings. GOLD employees receive assignments to perform strategic roles in key business initiatives. We provide them with coaching and opportunities to interact with senior executives, which both develop the skills and experience of our GOLD employees and provide a platform through which they contribute fresh ideas that challenge the status quo. The GOLD program operates in the U.S. and has been relaunched in Europe following a pause in the program during the U.K.'s withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d).  (2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Manager-level Next Generation Global Leader program. Our Next Generation Global Leader program, for employees at the manager level, is a 15-month on-the-job program focused on preparing high-potential managers for director-level roles. Since fiscal 2022, 86 employees graduated from this program, and a new group of 56 employees has been selected to join this program in fiscal 2024.  (3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Senior leader General Manager Excellence program. Our general managers run our operating sites and have substantial and wide-ranging responsibilities. This program enhances the skills of our general managers by giving them exposure to industry best practices and opportunities to network internally and receive personalized career coaching, including a 3-day business simulation. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, 24 and 35 general managers, respectively, participated in this program. 19 19 19    (4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Front-line leader level Lead Now program. In fiscal 2023, we launched \u201cLead Now,\u201d a Catalent-wide leadership offering targeted for those who are new to people leadership. During the first 3 months of a new leadership role, this program teaches employees the fundamentals of leadership and identifies tools to inspire their teams while role-modeling Catalent values. We have already enrolled over 250 new leaders into this program.  Diversity and Inclusion  At Catalent, we cultivate a workplace that respects and welcomes all people; celebrates the unique backgrounds and experiences of our workforce; encourages all employees to bring their true, authentic selves to work; and leverages our diversity to drive innovation, inclusion, and excellence in every aspect of our business. By closing diversity and inclusion gaps, we energize our people to do their best work.  Our commitment to D&I starts at the top with our board of directors (referred to herein as the \u201cboard of directors\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) and executive leadership team that bring a broad spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives. Led by our Diversity and Inclusion Office, and effectuated at all levels of the Company, we focus on attracting. retaining, and developing our diverse talent and creating an inclusive work environment globally.   We are committed to identifying and acknowledging gaps in our D&I mission and taking action to address them. To drive progress within Catalent, we focus on four strategic initiatives:  \u2022    Strengthening our culture of inclusion, supported by our nine employee resource groups; \u2022    Promoting inclusive leadership;  \u2022    Accelerating talent acquisition and development, including with support from external partners; and \u2022    Activating a data- and accountability-driven strategy.  One key example of our global D&I initiatives are our nine global employee resource groups (\u201cERGs\u201d), providing support, resources, and a forum for topical discussion and engagement for employees in the following categories: people with disabilities, people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent, women, indigenous peoples, people of Hispanic and/or LatinX descent, our LGBTQ+ community, people of African descent, Gen Y and Z, and people with military and/or first responder service. Our ERG network includes 127 global, virtual, and site-based chapters.   Key D&I performance highlights are captured in our Corporate Responsibility and Environmental, Social, and Governance Strategy section below.  Engagement  Our employee-focused practices make a clear impact on our employee engagement. Through increased engagement, we can grow our business by relying on strong, engaged leaders and professionals willing to ensure we can overcome and thrive during any challenge.  We periodically administer a company-wide engagement survey to garner direct feedback from our employees regarding how we can more deeply and meaningfully engage them, enabling us to focus on improving specific areas where we can support our people.   In fiscal 2023 we changed our approach to employee engagement surveys and launched our first \u201cpulse survey,\u201d using an online platform to deliver an updated engagement score and immediate access to results for all our people leaders on a more frequent basis. This first pulse survey, in November 2022, led to a companywide score of 6.9 out of a possible 10 for Catalent (using a rating scale from 1 to 10). The platform highlighted key strengths, including our inclusive culture, peer relationships, goal setting, and meaningful work. The survey also highlighted areas requiring further focus, including workload, strategy communication, and rewards.   Corporate Responsibility (\u201cCR\u201d) and ESG Strategy   Our CR strategy, which includes our ESG strategy, is integrated into our company-wide strategic plan, ensuring that we operate in alignment with our values, meet our commitments to all our stakeholders, and contribute to the long-term success of the broader biopharmaceutical, pharmaceutical, and consumer health industries and the communities where we operate. Our approach to ESG focuses on three areas of society relevant to our business, prioritizing our impact on (i) people, (ii) the environment, and (iii) our communities. We focus on ESG areas that are the most significant to our business, and our strategy is  20 20 20   informed by our employees, customers, investors, communities, and other key stakeholders. Our fiscal 2023 ESG performance, described below, demonstrates our contribution to the long-term success of the industries we serve and the communities where we operate, as we continue to invest in a corporate culture that understands and prioritizes our impact on people in our operations and employee-related decision-making.  Fiscal 2023 brought new and continued challenges for our operations, including the on-going response to the Ukrainian-Russian war, significant reductions in the volume of vaccines produced for the COVID-19 pandemic, and the on-going supply chain challenges amid rising global inflation. Through it all, our mission and values continued to provide steady, critical orientation and focus. Amid these fiscal 2023 challenges, our business delivered approximately 70 billion unit doses, across more than 50 sites, where our workforce of over 17,000 worked hard, with our Patient First value guiding the way, to ensure that we met our commitments to our customers and their patients.  Governance  We are committed to ensuring strong corporate governance practices on behalf of our shareholders and other stakeholders. We believe strong corporate governance and an independent board of directors provide the foundation for financial integrity and shareholder confidence. More information about our corporate governance features can be found in Item 10. \u2014 Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance.  Our CR council, which reports to the CEO and is composed of senior leaders from various parts of our business, guides our CR efforts and sets our overall CR strategy. Management, including members of the CR council, provide regular CR updates to our board of directors, which regularly reviews material aspects of our CR strategy and performance as a full board and through its several committees, including a formal annual review of our overall CR strategy and performance.  Business Benefits  Beyond being the right thing to do, our focus on CR strengthens our business by reducing risks, meeting customer and investor expectations, and positioning us to attract top talent. CR performance is an important contributor to our business success. It informs our risk management process, protects our reputation, and alerts us to regulatory, environmental, and societal threats to our business. Our CR activities also align with many of our customers\u2019 CR programs and strengthen our relationships.  Our future success depends on our highly skilled and dedicated global team of employees, who are passionate about improving health outcomes. We compete for top talent in our industry and recognize that our culture and reputation as a responsible company can be a differentiator for attracting job candidates and keeping and motivating our existing employees.     ESG progress in fiscal 2023  We made significant progress in several ESG focus areas in fiscal 2023:  \u2022In February 2023, we published our fourth annual Corporate Responsibility report (covering fiscal 2022), which includes an evaluation of our performance against the standards set by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Some highlights of our progress include:  \u25e6purchasing renewable electricity for our operating sites, with energy attribution certificates (EACs) accounting for 81% of our electricity use by the end of fiscal 2022, compared to 23% at the end of fiscal 2021, thus reducing our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 38%, from a fiscal 2020 baseline; \u25e6implementing 153 sustainability projects, resulting in annual energy savings of more than 4%, compared to our fiscal 2018 baseline; \u25e6achieving our water efficiency target, of <500m3/$1M revenue, a year early, reducing our water intensity by 26%, from a fiscal 2020 baseline; \u25e6converting 1,400 metric tons of uncontaminated by-product (24% of the total volume) diverted from landfill, converting it to alternative uses, such as adhesive; \u25e6philanthropic giving that exceeded $1 million, driven significantly by philanthropic efforts related to the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine and, our on-going commitment to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, and nonprofits that serve patients, with a focus on underserved communities; and \u25e62,200 employees participated in the Catalent Cares Matching Gift Program, a 46% increase from fiscal 2021, raising $1 million for 625 non-profits in combined employee donations and Company matches. 21 21 21    \u2022In fiscal 2023, we continued to drive D&I by (1) investing in the inclusive capabilities of our leaders, (2) working with partners who share our values and help enable our strategy, (3) accelerating diverse talent acquisition and development, and (4) curating an even more inclusive culture.  Some highlights of our progress include:  \u25e6a 17% increase (from 23% to 27%) in our U.S.-based leaders who are racially or ethnically diverse; \u25e6a 9% increase (from 35% to 38%) in women in leadership roles globally; \u25e6confirmation that we closed the U.S. gender pay gap in fiscal 2021 through EDGE certification; \u25e6publication of a Supplier Diversity Policy and setting the ambition to increase diverse supplier spend; \u25e6designation as a 2022 Best Place to Work for people with disabilities, based on the Disabilities Equality Index; \u25e6rollout of our inclusive leadership workshops for site and functional leadership teams and ongoing conversations hosted by our leaders following challenging current events in the U.S.; and \u25e6expansion of our ERGs, with a 21% increase in the number of ERG chapters, and a record 43 global ERG events with 7,500 attendees.  Looking ahead  We are determined to play an integral role in moving our industry toward more responsible and sustainable business practices as we continue to be at the cutting edge of developing and reliably supplying drugs, biologics, and consumer health products.   We continue to reduce our carbon emissions and have committed to Science Based Targets (SBT). The SBT report we submitted for assessment details a target reduction for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, based on a fiscal 2022 baseline, and a goal for engaging our Scope 3 footprint by aligning emission reduction targets to SBT goals. We have achieved our water intensity goal, to decrease water intensity to 500 cubic meters per $1 million in revenue and will now focus on sites in water-deprived or sensitive areas, to reduce our water usage further. At the end of fiscal 2023, 65% of our sites were able to eliminate waste sent to landfill; in fiscal 2024, we expect to achieve this at all of our facilities. We have performed a risk assessment and identified process and infrastructure changes needed for us to achieve our bold goal to ensure no residual active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) above Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) in wastewater. Activities to implement this goal will occur throughout fiscal 2024.  We continue to strengthen our supply chain by expanding our supplier assessment and auditing program, including continued use of our third-party vetting and due diligence platform in alignment with the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) principles and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Our diverse supplier network and spend will continue to increase, as outlined in our new Diverse Supplier Policy.  Measuring against our baseline D&I statistics, we will work to progress our goal of recruiting, developing, and retaining more diverse talent, including in leadership roles. In fiscal 2024, we will further implement our D&I action plans, which outline localized strategies and goals to help us meet our company-wide targets.  We continue to participate in external benchmarks, including the Corporate Equality Index (LGBTQ+ inclusion) and the Disability Equality Index to guide our goals and progress.  Through training, forums, and internal performance metrics, we will continue to combat unconscious biases that can impact the hiring and promotion of diverse talent. Our employee surveys reveal that our employees are energized and engaged by our CR and D&I initiatives. In fiscal 2024, we will continue to assess our employees\u2019 overall engagement and inclusion through our next corporate engagement survey.  Further information on our CR program is available at catalent.com/about-us/corporate-responsibility/, but this website is not part of our public disclosures and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.  Intellectual Property  We use a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect certain innovative aspects of our offerings, services, and intangible assets that we have developed. These proprietary rights can be important to aspects of our ongoing operations.
