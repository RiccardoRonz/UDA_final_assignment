Our corporate purpose is to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. We offer to our customers, referred to as \"guests,\" everyday essentials and fashionable, differentiated merchandise at discounted prices. We operate as a single segment designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores or through our digital channels. Since 1946, we have given 5 percent of our profit to communities.  Strategy  Our team, technology, and operations enable us to serve guests, fulfill our purpose, and drive business results through a durable, growth-focused enterprise strategy that differentiates Target in the marketplace. The six pillars of our strategy are:  \u2022Differentiating from our competition with our assortment of unique owned brands and curated leading national brands; \u2022Investing to create an engaging, convenient, safe, and differentiated shopping experience for our guests; \u2022Leveraging our stores as fulfillment hubs to efficiently meet our guests' needs, whether they purchase online or in-store; \u2022Engaging with our guests through programs like Target Circle and RedCard to maintain and enhance our relevancy;  \u2022Delivering affordability to our guests; and \u2022Leveraging our size and scale to benefit people, the planet, and our business, primarily through Target Forward, our enterprise sustainability strategy.  Our recent growth in sales demonstrates the strength and relevance of Target\u2019s strategy. Our strategy places stores at the center of our flexible fulfillment approach, with stores fulfilling more than 96 percent of total sales, which provides convenience for our guests at a reduced fulfillment cost.

Nearly all of our stores larger than 170,000 square feet offer a variety of general merchandise and a full line of food items comparable to traditional supermarkets. Our digital channels include a wide merchandise and food assortment, including many items found in our stores, along with a complementary assortment sold by Target and third parties.

CVS Pharmacy, Inc. (CVS) operates pharmacies and clinics in our stores under a perpetual operating agreement from which we generate annual occupancy income.   Customer Loyalty Programs  Our guests receive a 5 percent discount on nearly all purchases and receive free shipping at Target.com when they use their Target Debit Card, RedCard Reloadable Account, Target Credit Card, or Target MasterCard\u00ae (collectively, RedCards\u2122). We also seek to drive customer loyalty and trip frequency through our Target Circle program, where members earn 1 percent rewards on nearly all non-RedCard purchases, among other benefits.  Distribution  The vast majority of merchandise is distributed to our stores through our network of distribution centers. Common carriers ship merchandise to and from our distribution centers. Vendors or third-party distributors ship certain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores. Merchandise sold through our digital channels is distributed to our guests through guest pick-up at our stores, via common carriers (from stores, distribution centers, vendors, and third-party distributors), and delivery via our wholly owned subsidiary, Shipt, Inc. (Shipt). Our stores fulfill the majority of the digitally originated sales, which allows improved product availability, faster fulfillment times, reduced shipping costs, and allows us to offer guests a suite of same-day fulfillment options such as Order Pickup, Drive Up, and Shipt.

We are among the largest private employers in the United States (U.S.), and our workforce has varying goals and expectations of their employment relationship, from team members looking to build a career to students, retirees, and others who are seeking to supplement their income in an enjoyable atmosphere. We seek to be an employer of choice to attract and retain top talent no matter their objectives in seeking employment. To that end, we strive to foster an engaged, diverse, inclusive, safe, purpose-driven culture where employees, referred to as \"team members,\" have equitable opportunities for success.  As of January\u00a028, 2023, we employed approximately 440,000 full-time, part-time, and seasonal team members. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, employment levels\u00a0peak in the holiday season. We also engage independent contractors, most notably in our Shipt subsidiary.  Our Board of Directors, through the Compensation and Human Capital Management Committee, oversees human capital management matters.   Talent Development and Engagement  We offer a compelling work environment with meaningful experiences and abundant growth and career-development opportunities. This starts with the opportunity to do challenging work and learn on the job and is supplemented by programs and continuous learning that help our team build skills at all levels, including programs focused on specialized skill development, leadership opportunities, coaching, and mentoring. Our talent and succession planning process supports the development of a diverse talent pipeline for leadership and other critical roles. We monitor our team members\u2019 perceptions of these commitments through a number of surveys and take steps to address areas needing improvement.  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I)  We embrace diversity and strive to give our team members equitable access to opportunities. We champion workplace diversity and an inclusive work environment with a focus on attracting, engaging, developing, and advancing team members equitably in order to reflect the guests and communities we serve. We monitor the representation of women and racially or ethnically diverse team members at different levels throughout the company and disclose the composition of our team in our annual Workforce Diversity Report and EEO-1 report. We set company-wide DE&I goals to drive progress in these areas. Developing environments where all team members feel seen, heard, and welcome to belong is part of Target's core value of inclusivity and is fundamental to creating an inclusive guest experience.  Compensation and Benefits  Our compensation and benefits are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our team members and their families. We believe in paying team members equitably, regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity, and we regularly review the pay data of U.S. team members to confirm that we are doing so. Our compensation packages include a starting wage range of $15 to $24 per hour for U.S. hourly team members in our stores and supply chain facilities (who comprise the vast majority of our team), a 401(k) plan with dollar-for-dollar matching contributions up to five percent of eligible earnings, paid vacation and holidays, family leave, merchandise and other discounts, disability insurance, life insurance, healthcare and dependent care flexible spending accounts, debt-free education assistance and tuition reimbursement, free mental health services, an annual short-term incentive program, long-term equity awards, and health insurance benefits, including free virtual health care visits. Eligibility for, and the level of, benefits vary depending on team members\u2019 full-time or part-time status, work location, compensation level, and tenure.

This includes administering a comprehensive occupational injury- and illness-prevention program and training for team members.  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to invest in the well-being, health, and safety of our team members with a variety of mental, emotional, and physical wellness resources. We also enacted dozens of safety, social distancing, and cleaning measures designed to protect our team and guests during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Working Capital  Effective inventory management is key to our ongoing success, and we use various techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. We achieve effective inventory management by staying in-stock in core product offerings, maintaining positive vendor relationships, and carefully planning inventory levels for seasonal and apparel items to minimize markdowns. During 2022, rapid changes in consumer preferences and supply chain volatility resulted in increased working capital needs.  The Business Environment and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections in MD&A provide additional details.  Competition  We compete with traditional and internet retailers, including department stores, off-price general merchandise retailers, wholesale clubs, category-specific retailers, drug stores, supermarkets, direct-to-consumer brands, and other forms of retail commerce. Our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers and provide compelling value to our guests largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry.   Intellectual Property  Our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy. Our principal trademarks, including Target, our \"Expect More. Pay Less.\" brand promise, and our \"Bullseye Design,\" have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We also seek to obtain and preserve intellectual property protection for our brands.
