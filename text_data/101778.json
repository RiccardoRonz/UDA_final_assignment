Business and Properties General and Business Strategy  General  Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) is an independent exploration and production company incorporated in 2001, focused on U.S. resource plays: Eagle Ford in Texas, Bakken in North Dakota, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma and Permian in New Mexico and Texas. Our U.S. assets are complemented by our international operations in E.G. Our corporate headquarters is located at 990 Town and Country Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77024-2217 and our telephone number is (713)\u00a0629-6600. Each of our two reportable operating segments are organized by geographic location and managed according to the nature of the products and services offered. The two segments are: \u2022United States\u00a0\u2013 explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States; and \u2022International \u2013 explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States as well as produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G. Business Strategy  Our overall business strategy is to responsibly deliver competitive corporate level returns, free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders, all of which are sustainable and resilient through long-term commodity price cycles. We expect to achieve our business strategy by adherence to a disciplined reinvestment rate capital allocation framework that limits our capital expenditures relative to our expected cash flow from operations. Keeping our workforce safe, maintaining a strong balance sheet, responsibly meeting global energy demand with a focus on continuously improving environmental performance, serving as a trusted partner to our local communities and maintaining best in-class corporate governance standards are foundational to the execution of our strategy.  In February 2023, we announced a 2023 capital budget of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion that prioritizes free cash flow generation over production growth, consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework. We believe our financial strength, quality portfolio, ongoing focus on maintaining a competitive cost structure and disciplined capital allocation framework position us to navigate a variety of commodity price environments. See Item\u00a07. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.   6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our portfolio is concentrated in our core operations in the U.S. resource plays and E.G. The map below shows the locations of our U.S. resource plays:   7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Segment Information In the following discussion regarding our United States and International segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.  United States Segment We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the U.S. Our primary focus in the United States segment is concentrated within our four high-quality resource plays. See Item\u00a07. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further detail on current year results. United States \u2013 U.S. Resource Plays  Eagle Ford \u2013 We have been operating in the South Texas Eagle Ford play since 2011, where our acreage is located in Karnes, Atascosa, Gonzales, Lavaca, DeWitt, Bee and Live Oak Counties. We operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the play that support more than 1,600 producing wells. We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes and Atascosa Counties. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired approximately 130,000 net proved and unproved acres, with an average 97% working interest, and approximately 700 existing wells from Ensign Natural Resources. Bakken \u2013 We have been operating in the Williston Basin since 2006. The majority of our core acreage is within McKenzie, Mountrail and Dunn Counties in North Dakota targeting the Middle Bakken and Three Forks reservoirs. Oklahoma \u2013 With a history in Oklahoma that dates back more than 100 years, our primary focus has been development in the STACK Meramec and SCOOP Woodford, while progressing delineation of other plays across our acreage. We primarily hold net acreage with rights to the Woodford, Springer, Meramec, Osage and other prospect intervals, with a majority of this in the SCOOP and STACK. Permian \u2013 We have been operating in the Northern Delaware basin, which is located within the greater Permian area, since closing on two major acquisitions in 2017. Our focus has been to advance our position through execution of strategic acreage trades, progress early delineation and development of our acreage, improve our cost structure and secure midstream solutions. We have the majority of our acreage in Eddy and Lea counties primarily in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring New Mexico plays.  International Segment  We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in E.G. We include the results of our investments in a LPG processing plant and LNG and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International segment.  International  Equatorial Guinea \u2013 We own a 63% and an 80% operated working interest in two separate production sharing contracts (Alba PSC and Block D PSC, respectively), which we produce from the Alba field, located offshore E.G. These production sharing contracts were unitized in 2017 resulting in the Alba Unit in which we own a 64% operated working interest. Equatorial Guinea \u2013 Gas Processing \u2013 The following facilities located on Bioko Island, all accounted for as equity method investments, allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba field. We own a 52% interest in Alba Plant LLC, which operates an onshore LPG processing plant. Alba field natural gas is processed by the LPG plant under a fixed-price long-term contract. The LPG plant extracts condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations.  We also own 56% of EGHoldings, which operates a 3.7 mmta LNG production facility. Under EGHoldings\u2019 current sales and purchase agreement, which ends on December 31, 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. We are progressing new LNG agreements expected to begin on January 1, 2024, and our intention is to secure increased exposure to global LNG market prices. EGHoldings\u2019 gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled approximately 2 mmta in 2022.  Additionally, Alba Plant LLC and EGHoldings process the third-party gas from the Alen field under a combination of a tolling fee and profit-sharing arrangement, the benefits of which are included in our respective share of income from equity method investments. Efforts are underway to secure additional regional third-party gas volumes to be processed by Alba Plant LLC and EGHoldings thereby creating a regional gas hub in E.G. We also own 45% of AMPCO, which operates a methanol plant. AMPCO had gross sales totaling approximately 2,351 mtd in 2022. Methanol production is sold to customers in Europe and the U.S.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Reserves Proved reserves are required to be disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves.

In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international production sharing contracts or exploration licenses.

See Item\u00a08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2013 Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities \u2013 Results of Operations for Oil and Gas Production Activities for more information regarding production costs. Marketing  Our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. Major Customers We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuous review, and includes the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate.  Customers and their respective affiliates who accounted for 10% or more of our total commodity sales were as follows:  \u00a0December 31,202220212020Percentage of Total Commodity SalesMarathon Petroleum Corporation22\u00a0%17\u00a0%13\u00a0%Valero Marketing and Supply12\u00a0%10\u00a0%N/ATrafigura Groupe Pte.

In addition to the contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms. Competition  Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry, and we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, national oil companies, and to a lesser extent, companies that supply alternative sources of energy. We compete, in particular, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties, in the exploration for and development of new reserves, the marketing and delivery of our production into worldwide commodity markets and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology, experience and expertise, economic analysis in connection with portfolio management and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. Government Regulations Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including those related to oil and gas exploration and production and to the protection of health, environment and safety. New laws have been enacted or are otherwise being considered and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis. The costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations cannot be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. However, the current federal administration has begun implementing policies to increase regulation of oil and gas activity with the express purpose of transitioning the economy to lower-carbon sources of energy consistent with the administration\u2019s focus on climate change. This administration\u2019s climate policies have been wide-ranging and have included both legislative and executive branch action to address climate change and provide incentives to accelerate development of renewable resources. The current administration has issued a number of executive and temporary orders and policy changes that address broad ranging issues including climate change, oil and gas activities on federal lands, infrastructure and environmental justice. These actions have been followed by a number of related regulatory proposals that are in various stages of the rulemaking process including: more stringent and potentially overlapping regulations of emissions from oil and gas activities, expected further expansion of the definition of Waters of the U.S., increased barriers to access to federal lands for oil and gas development, increased protection for endangered species, more stringent permitting requirements for oil and gas facilities, additional disclosures for climate change risks and implementing regulations for provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.  We expect these regulatory changes, if finalized, may increase our administrative costs and affect the issuance of permits and/or agency approvals. If permits and approvals are not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling activities due to these orders or policy changes, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. At this time, we do not expect that the proposed or anticipated rulemakings will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations, size and financial strength. However, the finalized versions of the proposed rules or new rules could have a material adverse impact on our business individually or collectively, depending on the final terms and timing of implementation. States in which we operate are also considering making proposals to address climate change or increase regulation of the oil and gas industry. While there are not currently climate-related regulations proposed or pending at the state level in our operating areas that we believe will result in material capital, operating, tax or other costs to the business at this time, such regulations could be proposed and/or passed into law in 2023 or beyond. Other regulations currently in place could be withdrawn and replaced with more stringent requirements in the future. 14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. Environmental Remediation and Waste Management Our business is subject to laws relating to remediation of environmental pollution and the storage, handling and disposal of waste. These laws, and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules, can impose certain operational requirements for (i) minimization of pollution, (ii) monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements or (iii) other operational or siting constraints on our business. These controls result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil and produced water, into the environment, or require costs to remediate third-party sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations.  Waste regulations include those for management, storage, transportation and disposal. Additional or expanded regulations relating to oilfield waste may be adopted in the future that potentially impact the costs of compliance, handling, management and availability of disposal options.  Air and Climate Change Concerns about emissions from oil and gas activities including volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases may affect us and other similarly situated companies operating in the oil and gas industry. As described in more detail below, several regulatory proposals seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. While we cannot fully evaluate potential impacts of such proposed rules until they are finalized, as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship and as required by law, we estimate and publicly report certain greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are also working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. Finally, we have also undertaken initiatives to highlight our commitment to improving environmental performance, including introducing new quantitative goals for the near, medium and long-term time horizon across three core areas of focus: GHG intensity, methane intensity and gas capture. We have added a GHG emissions intensity target to our short-term incentive annual cash bonus scorecard to better reflect these initiatives. Government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states and other jurisdictions seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. In June 2016, the EPA finalized amendments to the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), known as Subpart OOOOa, focused on achieving additional methane and volatile organic compound reductions from new and modified oil and natural gas production and transmission facilities. On November 15, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule intended to reduce methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would make the existing regulations in Subpart OOOOa more stringent and create a Subpart OOOOb to expand reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and gas sources, including standards focusing on certain source types that have never been regulated under the Clean Air Act (including intermittent vent pneumatic controllers, associated gas and liquids unloading facilities). In addition, the proposed rule would establish \u201cEmissions Guidelines,\u201d creating a Subpart OOOOc that would require states to develop plans to reduce methane emissions from existing sources that must be at least as effective as presumptive standards set by the EPA. On November 15, 2022, the EPA issued a proposed rule supplementing the November 2021 proposed rule. Among other things, the November 2022 supplemental proposed rule removes an emissions monitoring exemption for small wellhead-only sites and creates a new third-party monitoring program to flag large emissions events, referred to in the proposed rule as \u201csuper emitters\u201d. The EPA is expected to issue a final rule by late 2023. In mid-2021, the State of New Mexico implemented regulations that seek to reduce GHG emissions in the state. In November 2022, BLM proposed a rule requiring additional royalties on methane emissions and regulations designed to limit venting and flaring on public and tribal lands, and a final rule is expected by late 2023. 15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents The EPA finalized a more stringent NAAQS for ozone in October 2015. States that contain any areas designated as non-attainment, and any tribes that chose to do so, were required to complete development of implementation plans. The EPA may in the future designate additional areas, including but not limited to portions of the Permian Basin, as non-attainment, impacting areas in which we operate. In January 2023, the EPA proposed a rule that would lower the annual particulate matter of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) NAAQS from the current 12 micrograms per meter cubed (\u00b5g/m3) to a level between 9 \u00b5g/m3 and 10 \u00b5g/m3, and comments are due by March 28, 2023. The implementation of this proposed limit, or the promulgation of a more stringent standard in the future, may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation (if finalized), the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented.  Hydraulic Fracturing Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. The federal administration previously included as part of its platform actions that could amount to a de facto ban on hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and the EPA and other federal agencies, including the BLM, have previously made proposals that, if implemented, could either restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to further regulation (and there is some question as to whether this could extend to tribal lands). Further, state and local-level initiatives may be proposed in regions with substantial shale resources to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with these initiatives, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. Water In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cCorps\u201d) published proposed regulations which expand the scope of surface waters that are regulated under the federal CWA and its various programs known as WOTUS. In 2015, the EPA and the Corps issued a rule defining the scope of the EPA\u2019s and the Corps\u2019 jurisdiction over WOTUS, which never took effect before being replaced by the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (\u201cNWPR\u201d) in 2020. A coalition of states and cities, environmental groups and agricultural groups challenged the NWPR, which was vacated by a federal district court in August 2021. The EPA is undergoing a two-phase rulemaking process to redefine WOTUS, which could be impacted by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming decision in Sackett v. EPA, a case regarding the proper test in determining whether wetlands qualify as WOTUS. A final rule, known as \u201cRule 1\u201d, was announced by the EPA and the Corps in December 2022. The EPA and the Corps are expected to propose a second rule, known as \u201cRule 2\u201d, further refining Rule 1, by November 2023 and issue a final rule by July 2024. Any expansion of CWA jurisdiction could result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. There is also increasing interest in nature-related matters beyond protected species, such as general biodiversity, which may similarly require us or our customers to incur costs or take other measures which may adversely impact our business or operations. Other Oil and Gas Regulations The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has undertaken actions to rescind, revise or reinstate a number of wildlife-related regulations that relate to protection of endangered species and their habitats. Additional actions in this area are expected and may result in additional costs of compliance, as well as operational delays or siting challenges.

Although in the aggregate our trademarks and patents are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent or group of related trademarks or patents as critical or essential to our business as a whole. Human Capital Management  Oversight and Management At Marathon Oil, we believe talent is foundational to delivering on our corporate strategy. We believe it allows us to consistently deliver on our framework for success, aimed at achieving sustainable free cash flow, meaningful return of capital to our shareholders and differentiated execution underpinned by a strong balance sheet, ESG excellence and our multi-basin portfolio. We believe intentional human capital management strategies enable us to attract, develop, retain and reward our dedicated employees. We believe in creating a safe, clean and ethical environment where employees feel empowered to make a difference in support of our business objectives and strategies. Our Vice President of Human Resources has leadership accountability for our workforce management policies and programs and reports directly to our CEO. She reviews quarterly talent data with our Executive Committee to assess the talent landscape and ensure measurement and accountability for human capital outcomes. Our Board provides oversight to our human capital management strategies as an integral part of our overall Enterprise Risk Management process. Due to the importance of our workforce capabilities, the Board receives updates on our human capital management measures as topical matters arise, such as talent as an enterprise risk, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, succession, Health, Environment and Safety (HES) and corporate social responsibility. Please visit marathonoil.com/sustainability for information on all dimensions of our corporate social responsibility. The information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference herein or otherwise made a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other filings with the SEC. Our Culture We believe in fostering an inclusive culture to ensure the strength and resilience of our business. We are committed to creating an environment where everyone can achieve their full potential and respectful relationships are core to our culture. Our Code of Business Conduct, which applies to our directors, officers, employees and other parties when they are acting on behalf of Marathon Oil, reinforces our long-standing commitment to high ethical standards and summarizes the fundamental importance of acting with integrity. It includes specific sections on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d), as well as Mutual Respect. These sections include an emphasis on fostering an inclusive work environment and making hiring, promotion and disciplinary decisions based on relevant qualifications, merit, performance and similar job-related factors. We believe our diversity of people, experiences and ideas provides us with a business advantage. We are committed to fair and nondiscriminatory hiring and to celebrating the diversity of our workforce. Our Talent Landscape As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had 1,570 active, full-time employees worldwide. Approximately 73% of our full-time workforce was based in the United States with 27% in Equatorial Guinea. Through recruiting, training, workforce integration, education and vocational programs, we strive to have a workforce reflective of the areas in which we operate. In 2022 and as a result of intentional nationalization efforts, 93% of our MEGPL workforce was Equatoguinean. For the U.S. workforce, our average tenure for full-time employees as of December\u00a031, 2022 was 8 years, with 31% of our full-time population having 10 or more years of experience. Women and people of color each accounted for 32% of our U.S. full-time workforce. We encourage diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and cultivate our collaborative team environment by making training courses on diversity and inclusive leadership available to all employees. We support Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) to promote diverse perspectives, encourage networking and allow continuous development activities. We added two new ERGs in 2022 and expanded voluntary enterprise-wide DEI training to continue to foster our One Team culture. We also continued to support the mental well-being of our employees by focusing on educating and empowering our employees to talk about mental wellness and promoting the resources available to them, including new benefit offerings in 2022.  Additionally, we continued to offer our workforce flexibility program that preserves our collaborative One Team culture while also providing options for our employees to better manage their career, work-life balance and overall well-being. Further, we committed time this year to collect feedback from our employees to capture the unique characteristics that attract people to Marathon Oil and keep our employees engaged as part of our One Team culture. 17 17 17 Table of Contents Table of Contents Recognizing the cyclical nature of our business and the dynamic talent demands, we conduct a proactive risk analysis annually as part of our Enterprise Risk Management process, including a multi-year view of any potential talent risks to ensure we are prepared to respond to the macro- environment while setting ourselves up for long-term success. We fully leverage our common asset team organizational structure to drive knowledge sharing, collaboration and talent deployment across these teams which we believe results in efficiency gains and enhanced execution. We utilize a managed service provider to oversee efficient administration, equitable treatment and compliance auditing of our contingent labor workforce. Health, Environment and Safety We believe safety is a core value and engrained in all aspects of our business. We uphold our safety and health culture by attracting, developing and retaining individuals and partners who share our commitment to operational excellence. Marathon Oil\u2019s leadership establishes clear expectations to all personnel to comply with internal and external safety and health requirements. Furthermore, our HES values are embedded within our culture and the support we provide to our employees. We provide and require job specific HES training for our employees and safety-sensitive contractors as part of our Responsible Operations Management Systems (\u201cROMS\u201d), which is a comprehensive operations integrity management system. This training includes stop the job authority extended to all employees and contractors in the event of a potential safety risk or environmental impact.  We leverage our collective talent and seek diverse employee perspectives to address complex issues and events through the use of multi-functional teams and committees, such as our internal Centralized Emergency Response Team (\u201cCERT\u201d) and Emissions Management Committee (EMC). The EMC prioritizes GHG and methane emissions reduction opportunities across our enterprise and is responsible for ensuring appropriate funding is in place as part of our overall capital allocation process. Our commitment to addressing the dual challenge of meeting the world\u2019s growing energy demands while also taking action on climate change is evidenced by GHG intensity featuring prominently as a metric linked directly to compensation outcomes. Our values to collaborate, take ownership, be bold and deliver results enable us to excel, but that\u2019s only possible if our workforce is safe. We actively look out for each other, maintain a safe work environment, continuously improve our procedures and train our workforce. Marathon Oil utilizes ROMS to manage risk and strives for a safe, healthy and secure workplace where all those involved can work free of injury and illness. Our Total Recordable Injury Rate (\u201cTRIR\u201d) is just one of the metrics we use to measure our success in providing a safe working environment and is linked directly to compensation outcomes. Marathon strives to only partner with contractors who share our same commitment to safety and environmental impact. We carefully evaluate contractors through a rigorous supply chain process to verify they possess all necessary safety and health programs to execute work in a manner that meets our expectations. Benefits  We attract and retain talent by offering benefit programs that are competitive and comprehensive. These programs create flexibility that allows employees to develop a meaningful career and overall well-being for themselves and their families. In August 2022, we made the commitment to fund employee premiums for health plans through 2023 to help support them through ongoing inflationary pressures. Our goal is to support employees with benefit programs that are consistent with our company's vision and strategies. We align the value of the benefit programs to the local markets where we compete for talent, along with the broader oil and gas industry. We believe effective communication around our benefit programs helps ensure we understand employees' perceptions and values around our benefits and that our employees understand the breadth and value of the benefits provided. Compensation Our success is based on financial performance and operational results, and we believe that our compensation program is an important driver of that success. The primary objectives of our programs are to pay for performance, encourage long-term stockholder value and pay competitively. To accomplish this, our compensation program is designed to reward employees for their performance and motivate them to continue to perform at a high level through both absolute feedback and relative performance assessment. The annual cash bonus is our short-term incentive for eligible employees, which reinforces both corporate and individual annual performance and prioritizes both financial and operational metrics. In 2022, in addition to the annual cash bonus, we provided a one-time cash payment to all eligible full-time employees to recognize and reward their invaluable contribution to our operational and financial success, which included significantly exceeding our commitment to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid. Eligible employees may also receive long-term incentives in the form of restricted stock awards that vest over multiple years to support retention and aligns employee interests with those of our stockholders, by driving value at the enterprise level. We provide market-competitive pay levels to attract and retain the best talent. We regularly benchmark each component of our pay program, including our benefit programs against our peers and a broader subset of the oil and gas industry, to ensure we remain competitive. See the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section of our Annual Proxy for information on our Executive Officers. 18 18 18 Table of Contents Table of Contents Talent Development We invest in talent processes that drive high performance. We take a multi-pronged approach to organizational learning, which is driven through our centralized on-demand development hub and informed by our enterprise-wide talent assessment process. Our organizational learning approach blends online, on-the-job and classroom training with 360 assessments and leadership coaching to ensure all employees receive the feedback, tools and time they need to reach their fullest potential. Continuous leadership development is offered to all leaders throughout the year and content is intentionally focused on learning objectives. These programs range from new manager trainings to executive-level business simulations. We review talent across the enterprise, measuring both technical and leadership capabilities. We leverage these talent assessments to identify critical skill gaps, guide critical skills training and ensure the effective deployment of talent. Our talent planning processes are aligned and consistent across the organization to ensure top talent occupies our most critical roles. Our succession process is designed to ensure we have identified the experiences and exposures needed to prepare employees for success in future senior leadership roles. We utilize an employee mentoring program, which focuses on increasing communication, connection and trust to advance our company\u2019s culture. We also continued our Board mentoring program, which pairs senior leaders with directors.
