Electric (CenterPoint Energy)  The Electric reportable segment is comprised of Houston Electric and Indiana Electric.  For information regarding the properties of the Electric reportable segment, please read \u201cProperties\u00a0\u2014 Electric (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)\u201d in Item\u00a02 of this report, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  Houston Electric (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric) \u00a0 Houston Electric is a transmission and distribution electric utility that operates wholly within the state of Texas. Houston Electric does not make direct retail or wholesale sales of electric energy or own or operate any power generation generating facilities other than TEEEF.    Electric Transmission \u00a0 On behalf of REPs, Houston Electric delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kV in locations throughout Houston Electric\u2019s certificated service territory. Houston Electric constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the PUCT.  Electric Distribution \u00a0 Houston Electric\u2019s distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity for REPs in its certificated service area by carrying lower-voltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer through distribution feeders. Houston Electric\u2019s operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities, metering services, outage response services and call center operations. Houston Electric provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the PUCT. PUCT rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants. Rates for these services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the PUCT.   2 2 2   Bond Companies  Houston Electric has special purpose subsidiaries consisting of the Bond Companies, which it consolidates. These consolidated special purpose subsidiaries are wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote entities that were formed solely for the purpose of purchasing and owning transition or system restoration property through the issuance of Securitization Bonds, and conducting activities incidental thereto. The Securitization Bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in Houston Electric\u2019s service territory.\u00a0On August 15, 2022, Restoration Bond Company repaid in full its last outstanding system restoration bonds at maturity. For further discussion of the Securitization Bonds and the outstanding balances as of December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.  Customers \u00a0 Houston Electric serves nearly all of the Houston/Galveston metropolitan area near the Texas gulf coast. Houston Electric\u2019s customers consist of REPs, which sell electricity to metered customers in Houston Electric\u2019s certificated service area, and municipalities, electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside Houston Electric\u2019s certificated service area. Each REP is licensed by, and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by, the PUCT. Houston Electric does not have long-term contracts with any of its customers. It operates using a continuous billing cycle, with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to REPs each business day. For information regarding Houston Electric\u2019s major customers, see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.   The table below reflects the number of REPs and metered customers in Houston Electric\u2019s service area as of December\u00a031, 2022: \u00a0REPsResidentialCommercial/IndustrialTotal CustomersTexas gulf coast 64\u00a02,402,329\u00a0304,269\u00a02,706,598\u00a0  Competition \u00a0 There are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in Houston Electric\u2019s service area. For another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in Houston Electric\u2019s territory, it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT and, depending on the location of the facilities, may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities. Houston Electric is not aware of any other party intending to enter this business in its service area at this time. Distributed generation (i.e., power generation located at or near the point of consumption) could result in a reduction of demand for Houston Electric\u2019s distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date.   Seasonality \u00a0 Houston Electric\u2019s revenues are primarily derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of that REP. Houston Electric\u2019s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months when more electricity is used for cooling purposes.  Franchises \u00a0 Houston Electric holds non-exclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In exchange for the payment of fees, these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rights-of-way of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit. The terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 30 to 40\u00a0years.  3 3 3   Indiana Electric (CenterPoint Energy)  Indiana Electric consists of SIGECO\u2019s electric transmission and distribution services, including its power generating and wholesale power operations.

Based on its participation in the ICPA between OVEC and its shareholder companies, Indiana Electric has the right to 1.5% of OVEC\u2019s generating capacity output and shares in 1.5% of the operating expenses and debt obligations of OVEC.  MISO Related Activity  Indiana Electric is a member of the MISO, a FERC approved regional transmission organization. The MISO serves the electric transmission needs of much of the Midcontinent region and maintains operational control over Indiana Electric\u2019s electric transmission facilities as well as other utilities in the region. Indiana Electric is an active participant in the MISO energy markets, where it bids its generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procures power for its retail customers at Locational Marginal Price as determined by the MISO market. MISO-related purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by the MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on at least a net hourly position.\u00a0  MISO related activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows:  In GWhNet purchases (1)388\u00a0Net sales (2)883\u00a0 Net purchases (1) Net sales (2)  (1)Represents volume intervals when purchases from the MISO were in excess of generation sold to the MISO. (2)Represents volume intervals when sales to the MISO were in excess of purchases from the MISO.  Interconnections  As of December\u00a031, 2022, Indiana Electric had interconnections with Louisville Gas and Electric Company, Duke Energy Shared Services, Inc., Indianapolis Power\u00a0& Light Company, Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Big Rivers Electric Corporation providing the ability to simultaneously interchange approximately 750 MW during peak load periods.\u00a0Indiana Electric, as required as a member of the MISO, has turned over operational control of the interchange facilities and its own transmission assets to the MISO. Indiana Electric, in conjunction with the MISO, must operate the bulk electric transmission system in accordance with NERC Reliability Standards. As a result, interchange capability varies based on  5 5 5   regional transmission system configuration, generation dispatch, seasonal facility ratings and other factors. Indiana Electric is in compliance with reliability standards promulgated by the NERC.   Competition  There are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in Indiana Electric\u2019s service area.  Indiana Electric is a vertically integrated utility that owns the generation, transmission, and distribution components of a utility.  For another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in Indiana Electric\u2019s territory, it would be required to obtain IURC approval of such service territory. Indiana service territory certificates are exclusive. Distributed generation (i.e., power generation located at or near the point of consumption) could result in reduced demand for Indiana Electric\u2019s distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date.  Seasonality  Indiana Electric\u2019s revenues are primarily derived from rates that it collects from customers in its service territory based on the amount of electricity it delivers. Indiana Electric\u2019s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months when more electricity is used for cooling purposes, and during the cooler months when more electricity is used for heating purposes.  Natural Gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)  CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas engage in regulated intrastate natural gas sales and natural gas transportation and storage for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers. See the detail of customers by state below. CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas provide permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through CEIP. CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas also provided services in Minnesota consisting of residential appliance repair and maintenance services along with HVAC equipment sales and home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas through a third party as of December 31, 2022.   On January 10, 2022, CERC Corp. completed the sale of its Arkansas and Oklahoma Natural Gas businesses. For additional information regarding divestitures, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.   CenterPoint Energy completed the Restructuring on June 30, 2022, whereby the equity interests in Indiana Gas and VEDO, were transferred from VUH to CERC Corp. As a result, Indiana Gas and VEDO became wholly owned subsidiaries of CERC Corp. to better align CenterPoint Energy\u2019s organizational structure with management and financial reporting and to fund future capital investments more efficiently. For further information, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

In 2022, approximately 68% of CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas total throughput occurred in the first and fourth quarters. These patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during the colder months.  Supply and Transportation  In 2022, CenterPoint Energy\u2019s Natural Gas purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few months to three-year terms. Major suppliers are those that account for greater than\u00a010% of CenterPoint Energy\u2019s or CERC\u2019s annual natural gas supply purchases.   Major suppliers of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2022 were as follows:   \u00a0CenterPoint EnergyCERCTenaska Marketing Ventures, LLC34\u00a0%32\u00a0%Macquarie Energy, LLC15\u00a0%15\u00a0%Koch Energy Services, LLC10\u00a0%11\u00a0%\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total of major suppliers59\u00a0%58\u00a0%  Numerous other suppliers provided the remainder of CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s natural gas supply requirements.  CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas transports their natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate pipelines under contracts with remaining terms, including extensions, varying from one to fourteen years. CenterPoint Energy\u2019s  7 7 7   and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas anticipates that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration.  CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas actively engage in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply plans presented to and/or filed with each of its state regulatory authorities. These price stabilization activities include use of storage gas and contractually establishing structured prices (e.g., fixed price, costless collars and caps) with CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas\u2019 physical gas suppliers. Their gas supply plans generally call for 50\u201375% of normal winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion.   The regulations of the states in which CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas operate allow them to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas, including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the index-priced physical supply, to their customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in their tariffs. Depending upon the jurisdiction, the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically, ranging from monthly to semi-annually. The changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies.   CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas use various third-party storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peak-day requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather. CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas may also supplement contracted supplies and storage from time to time with stored LNG and propane-air plant production.  On an ongoing basis, CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas enter into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet their customer requirements. However, it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions, transportation constraints and other events. As a result of these factors, supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time, or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors.   CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas businesses continue to utilize AMAs associated with their utility distribution service in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas. Generally, AMAs are contracts between CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets. In these agreements, CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage, supply and delivery arrangements for CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas. CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas may receive compensation from the asset manager through payments made over the life of the AMAs.\u00a0CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas has an obligation to purchase their winter storage requirements that have been released to the asset manager under these AMAs. The AMAs have varying terms, the longest of which expires in 2027. Pursuant to the provisions of the agreements, CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas either sells natural gas to the asset manager and agrees to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas throughout the year at the same cost, or simply purchases its full natural gas requirements at each delivery point from the asset manager. For amounts outstanding under these AMAs, see Notes 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.  Competition \u00a0 CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas compete primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other gas distributors and marketers also compete directly for gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulations affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas\u2019 facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers.  Corporate and Other (CenterPoint Energy)  CenterPoint Energy\u2019s Corporate and Other consists of energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services, such as renewables, distributed generation and combined heat and power projects, through Energy Systems Group, and other corporate support operations that support CenterPoint Energy\u2019s business operations. CenterPoint Energy\u2019s Corporate and Other also includes office buildings and other real estate used for business operations.  8 8 8    REGULATION  The Registrants are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local governmental agencies, including the regulations described below. The following discussion is based on regulation in the Registrants\u2019 businesses as of December\u00a031, 2022.  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  The FERC has jurisdiction under the NGA and the NGPA, as amended, to regulate the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce that are not first sales. The FERC regulates, among other things, the construction of pipeline and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of these facilities. The FERC also regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, mergers, acquisitions and corporate transactions by electricity companies, energy markets, reliability standards and the issuance of short-term debt by public utilities regulated by FERC. The FERC has authority to prohibit market manipulation in connection with FERC-regulated transactions, to conduct audits and investigations, and to impose significant civil penalties (up to approximately $1.5 million per day per violation, subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation) for statutory violations and violations of the FERC\u2019s rules or orders.  Indiana Electric is a \u201cpublic utility\u201d under the FPA and is subject to regulation by the FERC. Houston Electric is not a \u201cpublic utility\u201d under the FPA and, therefore, is not generally regulated by the FERC, although certain of its transactions are subject to limited FERC jurisdiction. The FERC has certain responsibilities with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The ERO and the FERC have authority to (a) impose fines and other sanctions on applicable entities that fail to comply with approved standards and (b) audit compliance with approved standards. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE and in MISO to ReliabilityFirst Corporation. Neither Houston Electric nor Indiana Electric anticipate that the reliability standards proposed by the NERC and approved by the FERC will have a material adverse impact on their operations. To the extent that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are required to make additional expenditures to comply with these standards, it is anticipated that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric will seek to recover those costs through the transmission charges that are imposed on all distribution service providers within ERCOT and the MISO, respectively, for electric transmission provided.  As a public utility holding company, under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, CenterPoint Energy and its consolidated subsidiaries are subject to reporting and accounting requirements and are required to maintain certain books and records and make them available for review by the FERC and state regulatory authorities in certain circumstances.  For a discussion of the Registrants\u2019 ongoing regulatory proceedings, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources \u2014 Regulatory Matters\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.  State and Local Regulation \u2013 Electric Transmission & Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)  Houston Electric is a member of ERCOT, which serves as the independent system operator and regional reliability coordinator for member electric power systems in most of Texas. The ERCOT market represents approximately 90% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation\u2019s largest power markets. The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards developed by the NERC, approved by the FERC and monitored and enforced by the Texas RE. The PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the state\u2019s main interconnected power transmission grid.   The ERCOT ISO is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ERCOT market. Houston Electric\u2019s transmission business, along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in Texas, supports the operation of the ERCOT ISO. Houston Electric participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities to plan, design, obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ERCOT transmission grid.  Houston Electric conducts its operations pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the PUCT that covers its present service area and facilities. The PUCT and certain municipalities have the authority to set the rates and terms of service provided by Houston Electric under cost-of-service rate regulation. Houston Electric holds non-exclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In exchange for payment of fees, these franchises give Houston  9 9 9   Electric the right to use the streets and public rights-of-way of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit. The terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 30 to 40\u00a0years.  In ERCOT, end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated REPs. Houston Electric\u2019s distribution rates charged to REPs for residential and small commercial customers are primarily based on amounts of energy delivered, whereas distribution rates for a majority of large commercial and industrial customers are primarily based on peak demand. All REPs in Houston Electric\u2019s service area pay the same rates and other charges for transmission and distribution services. This regulated delivery charge may include the transmission and distribution rate (which includes municipal franchise fees), a DCRF mechanism for recovery of incremental distribution-invested capital above that which is already reflected in the base distribution rate, a nuclear decommissioning charge associated with decommissioning the South Texas nuclear generating facility, an EECRF charge, and charges associated with securitization of regulatory assets, stranded costs and restoration costs. Transmission rates charged to distribution companies are based on amounts of energy transmitted under \u201cpostage stamp\u201d rates that do not vary with the distance the energy is being transmitted. All distribution companies in ERCOT pay Houston Electric the same rates and other charges for transmission services.  With the IURC\u2019s approval, Indiana Electric is a member of the MISO, a FERC-approved regional transmission organization.  The MISO serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the Midcontinent region and maintains operational control over Indiana Electric\u2019s electric transmission and generation facilities as well as those of other utilities in the region. Indiana Electric is an active participant in the MISO energy markets, bidding its owned generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procuring power for its retail customers at Locational Marginal Pricing as determined by the MISO market. Indiana Electric also receives transmission revenue that results from other members\u2019 use of Indiana Electric\u2019s transmission system. Generally, these transmission revenues, along with costs charged by the MISO, are considered components of base rates and any variance from that included in base rates is recovered from or refunded to retail customers through tracking mechanisms.  For a discussion of certain of Houston Electric\u2019s and Indiana Electric\u2019s ongoing regulatory proceedings, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources \u2014 Regulatory Matters\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.  State and Local Regulation \u2013 Electric Generation (CenterPoint Energy)  The energy and capacity secured from Indiana Electric\u2019s available generation resources are utilized primarily to serve the needs of retail electric customers residing within Indiana Electric\u2019s franchised service territory. Costs of operating Indiana Electric\u2019s generation facilities are recovered through IURC-approved base rates as well as periodic rate recovery mechanisms including the CECA, ECA, FAC, MCRA, and RCRA mechanism. Costs that are deemed unreasonable or imprudent by the IURC may not be recoverable through retail electric rates. Indiana Electric also receives revenues from the MISO to compensate it for benefits the generation facilities provide to the transmission system. Proceeds from the sales of energy from Indiana Electric\u2019s generation facilities that exceed the requirements of retail customers are shared by Indiana Electric and retail electric customers.  The generation facilities owned and operated by Indiana Electric are subject to various environmental regulations enforced by the EPA and the IDEM. Operations of Indiana Electric\u2019s generation facilities are subject to regulation by the EPA and the IDEM as it pertains to the discharge of constituents from the generation facilities. For further discussion, see \u201cOur Business \u2014 Environmental Matters\u201d below.   For a discussion of Indiana Electric\u2019s ongoing regulatory proceedings, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources \u2014 Regulatory Matters\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.  State and Local Regulation \u2013 Natural Gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)  In almost all communities in which CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas provides natural gas distribution services, they operate under franchises, certificates or licenses obtained from state and local authorities. The original terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 20 to 30\u00a0years. CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas expects to be able to renew expiring franchises. In most cases, franchises to provide natural gas utility services are not exclusive.  10 10 10   Substantially all of CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas is subject to cost-of-service rate regulation by the relevant state public utility commissions and, in Texas, by those municipalities that have retained original jurisdiction.  In certain of the jurisdictions in which they operate, CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas has annual rate adjustment mechanisms that provide for changes in rates dependent upon certain changes in invested capital, earned returns on equity or actual margins realized.     For a discussion of certain of CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas\u2019 ongoing regulatory proceedings, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources \u2014 Regulatory Matters\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.  Department of Transportation (CenterPoint Energy and CERC) CenterPoint Energy and CERC are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the NGPSA and the HLPSA. The NGPSA delegated to PHMSA through DOT the authority to regulate gas pipelines. The HLPSA delegated to PHMSA through DOT the authority to develop, prescribe and enforce federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline. Every four years PHMSA is up for reauthorization by Congress and with that reauthorization comes changes to the legislative requirements that Congress sets forth for the oversight of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. In 2020, the Pipes Act was enacted. The Pipes Act reauthorized PHMSA through 2023 and imposed a few new mandates on the agency. The law establishes a PHMSA technology pilot, authorizes a new idled pipe operating status and contains process protections for operators during PHMSA enforcement proceedings. Section 114 of the 2020 Pipes Act is a self-mandating rule for natural gas pipeline operations like CERC\u2019s. Section 114 focuses on processes and procedures to eliminate or reduce emissions during normal operations. Further, Section 113 of the Pipes Act directed PHMSA to develop regulations to require natural gas pipeline operators to implement leak detection and repair programs. A proposed rule is currently expected to be released by March 31, 2023.   In January 2021, PHMSA published a final rule amending the federal Pipeline Safety Regulations to ease regulatory burdens on the construction, operation, and maintenance of gas transmission, distribution, and gathering systems.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC anticipate that compliance with PHMSA\u2019s regulations, performance of the remediation activities by CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas and intrastate pipelines and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will continue to require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs. The level of expenditures will depend upon several factors, including age, location and operating pressures of the facilities. In particular, the cost of compliance with the DOT\u2019s integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing. Changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management, whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas, may also affect the costs incurred. Implementation by PHMSA of the Pipes Act, in particular Section 113, acts reauthorizing PHMSA or other future acts may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact compliance costs. In addition, CenterPoint Energy and CERC may be subject to the DOT\u2019s enforcement actions and penalties if they fail to comply with pipeline regulations.   ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  The following discussion is based on environmental matters in the Registrants\u2019 businesses as of December\u00a031, 2022. The Registrants\u2019 operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric transmission and distribution systems, steam electric and renewable generation systems and the facilities that support these systems, the Registrants must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact the Registrants\u2019 business activities in many ways, including, but not limited to:  \u2022restricting the way the Registrants can handle or dispose of wastes, including wastewater discharges and air emissions; \u2022limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered species; \u2022requiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by the Registrants\u2019 operations or attributable to former operations; \u2022enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and \u2022impacting the demand for the Registrants\u2019 services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of fossil fuels, including, but not limited to, natural gas.  11 11 11   To comply with these requirements, the Registrants may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to, among other activities:  \u2022construct or acquire new facilities and equipment; \u2022acquire permits for facility operations or purchase emissions allowances; \u2022modify, upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment; and \u2022decommission or remediate waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions and monitoring and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to assess, clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and/or property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.  Increasingly, environmental regulation has resulted in more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and monitoring, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts currently\u00a0anticipated. The Registrants try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to maintain compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations.   Based on current regulatory requirements and interpretations, the Registrants do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the Registrants believe that their current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish their operational ability. The Registrants cannot provide assurances that future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause them to incur significant costs. The following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety issues, laws and regulations that relate to the Registrants\u2019 operations. The Registrants believe that they are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulations.  Global Climate Change  There is increasing attention being paid in the United States and worldwide to the issue of climate change. As a result, from time to time, regulatory agencies have considered the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations addressing the emissions of GHG on the state, federal, or international level. On August 3, 2015, the EPA released its CPP rule, which required a 32% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015, and that action was immediately followed by litigation ultimately resulting in the U.S. Supreme Court staying implementation of the rule. On July 8, 2019, the EPA published the ACE rule, which (i) repealed the CPP rule; (ii) replaced the CPP rule with a program that requires states to implement a program of energy efficiency improvement targets for individual coal-fired electric generating units; and (iii) amended the implementing regulations for Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. On January 19, 2021, the majority of the ACE rule \u2014 including the CPP repeal, CPP replacement, and the timing-related portions of the Section 111(d) implementing rule \u2014 was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and on October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider four petitions filed by various coal interests and a coalition of 19 states. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA exceeded its authority in promulgating the CPP. The EPA has announced it plans on issuing new GHG emissions rules in the future.   The Biden administration recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement, which can be expected to drive a renewed regulatory push to require further GHG emission reductions from the energy sector and proceeded to lead negotiations at the global climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. On April 22, 2021, President Biden announced new goals of 50% reduction of economy-wide GHG emissions, and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035, which formed the basis of the United States\u2019 commitments announced in Glasgow. In September 2021, CenterPoint Energy announced its net zero emissions goals for both Scope 1 and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035 as well as a goal to reduce certain Scope 3 emissions by 20% to 30% by 2035. Because Texas is an unregulated market and customers choose their generation providers, CenterPoint Energy\u2019s Scope 2 estimates do not take into account Texas electric transmission and distribution assets in the line loss calculation and, in addition,  exclude emissions related to purchased power in Indiana between 2024 and 2026 as estimated. CenterPoint Energy\u2019s Scope 3 estimates are based on the total natural gas supply delivered to residential and commercial customers as reported in the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form EIA-176 reports and do not take into account the emissions of transport customers and emissions related to upstream extraction. These emission goals are expected to be used to position CenterPoint Energy to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements from the current and future administrations to further reduce GHG emissions. For more information regarding CenterPoint Energy\u2019s net zero and carbon emission reduction goals and their  12 12 12   related risks, see \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Risk Factors Affecting Regulatory, Environmental and Legal Risks \u2014 CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks ...\u201d CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of their operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. The IRA established the Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which imposes a charge on methane emissions from certain natural gas transmission facilities, and the EPA has proposed rules that target reductions in methane emissions, which are likely to increase costs related to production, transmission and storage of natural gas. Houston Electric, in contrast to some electric utilities including Indiana Electric, does not generate electricity, other than TEEEF, and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. CenterPoint Energy\u2019s net zero emissions goals are aligned with Indiana Electric\u2019s generation transition plan and are expected to position Indiana Electric to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements related to GHG emissions reductions.   To the extent climate changes may occur and such climate changes result in warmer temperatures in the Registrants\u2019 service territories, financial results from the Registrants\u2019 businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and CERC\u2019s Natural Gas could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales. On the other hand, warmer temperatures in CenterPoint Energy\u2019s and Houston Electric\u2019s electric service territory may increase revenues from transmission and distribution and generation through increased demand for electricity for cooling.\u00a0Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and flooding.\u00a0Since many of the Registrants\u2019 facilities are located along or near the Texas gulf coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers. When the Registrants cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers, or customers cannot receive services, the Registrants\u2019 financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and they generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.\u00a0To the extent the Registrants are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, the Registrants\u2019 future financial results may be adversely impacted.   Air Emissions  The Registrants\u2019 operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including electric generating facilities and natural gas processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions. The Registrants may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations, or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and potentially criminal enforcement actions. The Registrants may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.  Water Discharges  The Registrants\u2019 operations are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. The unpermitted discharge of pollutants, including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident, is prohibited. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material into wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from the Registrants\u2019 pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligations.  Waters of the United States  Under the Obama administration, the EPA promulgated a set of rules that included a comprehensive regulatory overhaul of defining \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d for the purposes of determining federal jurisdiction. The Trump administration signaled its intent to repeal and replace the Obama-era rules. In accordance with this intent, the EPA promulgated a rule in early 2018 that postponed the effectiveness of the Obama-era rules until 2020. Thereafter, the EPA proposed a new set of rules that would narrow the Clean Water Act\u2019s jurisdiction, which were finalized on April 21, 2020. That set of rules was vacated by recent decisions in the U.S. federal district courts in New Mexico and Arizona, and on November 18, 2021, the EPA released a proposal to reestablish the pre-2015 definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d which will become effective upon finalization and publication. On December 30, 2022, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced the final \u201cRevised Definition of \u2018waters of the United States\u201d\u2019 rule, which was published on January 18, 2023 and becomes effective on March 20,  13 13 13   2023. The potential impact of the revisions to the \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d regulations on the Registrants\u2019 business, liabilities, compliance obligations or profits and revenues is uncertain at this time.  ELG  In 2015, the EPA finalized revisions to the existing steam electric wastewater discharge standards which set more stringent wastewater discharge limits and effectively prohibited further wet disposal of coal ash in ash ponds.  These new standards are applied at the time of permit renewal and an affected facility must comply with the wastewater discharge limitations no later than December 31, 2023, and the prohibition of wet sluicing of bottom ash no later than December 31, 2025. In February 2019, the IURC approved Indiana Electric\u2019s ELG compliance plan for its F.B. Culley Generating Station, and Indiana Electric is currently finalizing its ELG compliance plan for the remainder of its affected units as part of its ongoing IRP process.  Cooling Water Intake Structures  Section 316 of the federal Clean Water Act requires steam electric generating facilities use \u201cbest technology available\u201d to minimize adverse environmental impacts on a body of water. In May 2014, the EPA finalized a regulation requiring installation of \u201cbest technology available\u201d to mitigate impingement and entrainment of aquatic species in cooling water intake structures. Indiana Electric is currently completing the required ecological studies and anticipates timely compliance in 2023.     Hazardous Waste  The Registrants\u2019 operations generate wastes, including some hazardous wastes, that are subject to the federal RCRA, and comparable state laws, which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment, transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste. RCRA currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste. Specifically, RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or\u00a0production of crude oil and natural gas. However, these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements of RCRA. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste. The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements.  Coal Ash  Indiana Electric has three ash ponds, two at the F.B. Culley facility (Culley East and Culley West) and one at the A.B. Brown facility. In 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates coal ash as non-hazardous material under the RCRA. The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash, and the majority of the ash generated by Indiana Electric\u2019s generating plants will continue to be beneficially reused. The EPA continues to propose amendments to the CCR Rule; however, under the CCR Rule as it is currently in effect, Indiana Electric is required to perform integrity assessments, including ground water monitoring, at its F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown generating stations. The ground water studies are necessary to determine the remaining service life of the ponds and whether a pond must be retrofitted with liners or closed in place. Preliminary groundwater monitoring indicates potential groundwater impacts very close to Indiana Electric\u2019s ash impoundments, and further analysis is ongoing. The CCR Rule required companies to complete location restriction determinations by October 18, 2018. Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that one F.B. Culley pond (Culley East) and the A.B. Brown pond fail the aquifer placement location restriction. As a result of this failure, Indiana Electric was required to cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by April 11, 2021. Indiana Electric filed timely requests for extensions available under the CCR Rule that would allow Indiana Electric to continue to use the ponds through October 15, 2023. The inability to take these extensions may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electric\u2019s future operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding, including the imposition of fines and penalties. On January 22, 2021, Indiana Electric received letters from the EPA for both the F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown facilities that determined Indiana Electric\u2019s extension submittals complete and extended the compliance deadline of April 11, 2021 until the EPA issues a final decision on the extension requests. On October 5, 2022, SIGECO received a proposed conditional approval of its extension request for the A.B. Brown facility.  The Culley West pond was closed under CCR provisions applicable to inactive ponds, and closure activities were completed in December 2020. For further discussion about Indiana Electric\u2019s ash ponds, please see Note 15(d) to the consolidated financial statements.   14 14 14   Liability for Remediation  CERCLA, also known as \u201cSuperfund,\u201d and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of \u201chazardous substances\u201d into the environment. Classes of PRPs include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills. Although petroleum, as well as natural gas, is expressly excluded from CERCLA\u2019s definition of a \u201chazardous substance,\u201d in the course of the Registrants\u2019 ordinary operations they do, from time to time, generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a \u201chazardous substance.\u201d CERCLA authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. Under CERCLA, the Registrants could potentially be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released, for damages to natural resources, and for associated response and assessment costs, including for the costs of certain health studies.  Liability for Preexisting Conditions  For information about preexisting environmental matters, please see Note 15(d) to the consolidated financial statements.
