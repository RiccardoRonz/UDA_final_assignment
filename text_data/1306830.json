We have long-standing relationships with most of these customers. Solvents and derivatives are sold to a diverse group of regional and multinational customers under multi-year contracts and on the basis of long-standing relationships. Solvents and derivatives customers are primarily engaged in the production of paints, coatings and adhesives. We manufacture formaldehyde for our own use as well as for sale to a few regional customers. Emulsion, RDP and EVA polymers products are sold to a diverse group of regional, family owned and multinational customers. Customers of our emulsion polymers and RDP business are manufacturers of water-based paints and coatings, adhesives, paper, building and construction products, glass fiber, non-wovens, textiles and premixed dry mortars. Customers of our EVA polymers business are engaged in the manufacture of a variety of products, including hot melt adhesives, automotive components, thermal laminations, and flexible and food packaging materials. Acetate tow is sold principally to the major tobacco companies that account for a majority of worldwide cigarette production. Many sales are conducted under contracts with pricing for one or more years. As a result, margins may expand or contract in response to changes in market conditions over these similar periods, and we may be unable to adjust pricing due to other factors, such as the intense level of competition in the industry. Pricing of our products within the Acetyl Chain segment is influenced by industry utilization, changes in the cost of raw materials, sensitivity to demand and the value-in-use. Therefore, in general, there is a direct correlation between these factors and our net sales for most Acetyl Chain products. This impact to pricing typically lags changes in raw material costs over months or quarters and impacts profit margins over those periods. See Note 22 - Revenue Recognition in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. Other Activities Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs, including administrative activities such as finance, information technology and human resource functions, interest income and expense associated with our financing activities and results of our captive insurance companies. Our two wholly-owned captive insurance companies are a key component of our global risk management program, as well as a form of self-insurance for our liability, property and workers compensation risks. The captive insurance companies retain risk at levels approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net risk retained. Other Activities also includes the interest cost, expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses components of our net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans, which are not allocated to our business segments. Ongoing merger, acquisition and integration related costs are also included in Other Activities. Strategic Affiliates Our strategic affiliates represent an important component of our strategy. During 2022, we acquired interests in several global strategic affiliates as part of the M&M Acquisition, described below.

Environmental and Other Regulation Matters pertaining to environmental and other regulations are discussed in Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors, as well as Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies, Note\u00a013 - Environmental and Note\u00a019 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We expect to incur approximately $20\u00a0million to $40\u00a0million in capital expenditures for environmental control measures in each of 2023 and 2024. Climate Change Climate change is one of the most challenging and significant issues facing the world today, and we seek to do our part to make sustainable progress toward addressing this challenge.  The nature of our operations is energy and fossil fuel intensive. We have therefore invested in capital projects to increase energy efficiency, improve reliability, recover and reuse waste heat, and increase our purchase of renewable energy as well as more sustainable raw materials. These include a combined heat and power unit at our Lanaken, Belgium facility, a waste-to- 13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents energy system in Nanjing, China, using solar energy at our Clear Lake, Texas facility designed for use by us and our onsite industrial partners, and a carbon dioxide capture and conversion to methanol project at our Clear Lake, Texas facility.  We are also focused on developing products to help our customers meet their sustainability goals. Examples include products for improving the sustainability of building and construction materials, adhesives, fiber coatings, flexible packaging, vehicle lightweighting and powering electric vehicles. We are also focused on making our own products from more sustainable sources, including increasing our offering products using biocertified content or recycled feedstocks. We believe these capabilities, together with trends such as the automobile industry's commitment towards improved energy efficiency and clean energy, present market opportunities for us. With the fourth quarter 2022 publication of our 2021-2022 Sustainability Report, we have reported gross Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions for 2020 and 2021 using The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, as a guide. Updated 2022 emissions figures were not available at the time of this filing. We have also announced a Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction target described in our 2021-2022 Sustainability Report, obtained limited external assurance on our baseline 2021 environmental metrics, and are working to better understand where we can further reduce our GHG emissions sources and to integrate the M&M Business into our GHG measurement and reporting processes. For information on the risks we face related to climate change and other sustainability matters as well as, potential legislative and regulatory developments in this area that may increase our operating costs, potentially significantly, please see the risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors titled \"We are subject to financial, regulatory, physical risks and transition associated with climate change and other sustainability matters as well as potential legislation, regulation and international accords to address climate change and other sustainability matters,\" \"Changes in environmental, health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our products\" and \"Our aspirations, goals, and initiatives related to sustainability, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to risks.\" Climate-related regulatory risks are assessed as a part of our Enterprise Risk Management process. However, due to the level of uncertainty regarding what legislative or regulatory requirements may be enacted, it is not possible for us to estimate the impact of climate-related developments on our results of operations or financial conditions. Human Capital Resources Workforce Composition and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Our business is operated by a diverse and global workforce, with employees in the following key geographies: Employees as of December 31, 2022North AmericaU.S.4,722\u00a0Other North America688\u00a0Total5,410\u00a0EuropeGermany1,896\u00a0Other Europe2,854\u00a0Total4,750\u00a0AsiaChina1,838\u00a0Other Asia1,074\u00a0Total2,912\u00a0Rest of World191\u00a0Total13,263\u00a0 14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents We believe that providing a workplace that promotes mutual respect and inclusion for all employees is critical to our success and to driving innovation and growth. To that end, we continue to make progress in our efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in our Company. In order attract a diverse pipeline of talent, we engage with historically black colleges and universities (\"HBCUs\"), trade associations and other professional groups to broaden our candidate pool. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council elevates employee voice to inform activities that foster an inclusive environment for all. We promote engagement globally through 59 chapters of nine different Employee Resource Groups designed to inspire, develop and increase the visibility, representation and promotion of underrepresented groups. As of December\u00a031,\u00a02022: \u2022globally, women represent approximately 44% of our senior leadership team and 25% of our overall workforce; and \u2022in the U.S., people of color represent approximately 13% of our senior leadership team and 30% of our overall workforce.  The following shows our attrition rate for the year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02022: Attrition RateEmployee CategoryGlobal employees10.9\u00a0%Women (globally)12.2\u00a0%People of Color (U.S.)12.9\u00a0% Stewardship: Health, Safety and Environmental We focus on more than the occupational health and safety of our employees, contractors and any visitors to our sites. We have an expanded view and measurement of \"Stewardship\" that includes process safety and releases to the environment since these incidents may have an impact on the communities where we live and work. Our Stewardship values are critical to our success in attracting and retaining the best industry talent across the globe. We strive to do no harm to people, the environment or the communities that host our facilities. We believe in continuous improvement in our Stewardship culture by building competency in our people and having a comprehensive management system built from recognized global practices. Our values include a commitment to the health and safety of our employees, contractors, communities and the environment. We utilize a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the Stewardship performance of our operations. Lagging indicators for occupational health and safety include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") Total Recordable Incident Rate (\"TRIR\") and the OSHA Lost Time Incident Rate (\"LTIR\") based upon the number of incidents per 200,000 work hours of both employees and contractors. Process Safety lagging indicators follow the industry standard from API RP 754 for Tier 1 and Tier 2 events for incident count, rate, and severity. The criteria for tracking release to the environment lagging indicators are 10% or greater of the Celanese reportable quantity (based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") methodology or internal values). Examples of Stewardship Tier 3 leading indicators include reporting and resolution of near miss events and hazard recognitions, all loss of primary containment releases and challenges to process safety systems.  For the year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02022, we had a TRIR of 0.24 and a LTIR of 0.04, which includes two months of safety statistics from the M&M Business. These statistics exclude COVID-19 related work place transmissions. Through deliberate actions, we have reduced our TRIR and LTIR rates by 23% and 69%, respectively, since 2017. Rounding out our Stewardship performance in 2022, we had 11 Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety incidents and 9 releases to the environment above the 10% significant threshold. Any other loss of primary containment incidents, challenges to pressure relief systems, safety instrumented systems and safe operating limits are tracked as Tier 3 leading indicators. Our expanded tracking of leading indicator events helps identify potential emerging deficiencies that enables us to take continuous improvement actions. For example, this past year we concentrated heavily on improving our hazard identification and risk assessment and migration systems, hand safety awareness (the most commonly impacted body part) and establishing clear requirements regarding our fundamental life critical procedures and their field execution while focusing to prevent injuries with the most significant consequences. In 2023, the criteria for tracking release to the environment lagging indicators referenced above  15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents changed from a Celanese based reportable quantity to a criteria that includes impact to the community and notification to a regulatory authority outside of routine communications. Talent Development We are committed to fostering an engaging and inclusive workplace with opportunities for collaboration, development and leadership. Our Talent Management strategies provide a consistent and efficient approach to how we acquire talent, manage performance, develop bench strength, support development and help employees reach their fullest potential. We have a structured approach to reviewing talent with management, as well as with the Board of Directors. This includes discussions of employee development, executive succession, diversity, talent pipelines and workforce planning requirements. We regularly report to the Board of Directors on talent management strategies across functional areas, and annually review executive succession with the Board of Directors.
