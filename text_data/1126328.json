The remaining sales were made primarily through unaffiliated broker-dealer firms. Principal Connection is our direct distribution channel for retail financial services products to individuals. Principal Connection\u2019s services are available by phone, email or mail.Retirement and Income Solutions\u00a0\u2013 SpreadInvestment OnlyProductsThe two primary products for which we provide investment only services are GICs and funding agreements.GICs and funding agreements pay a specified rate of return. The rate of return can be a floating rate based on an external market index or a fixed rate. Our investment only products contain provisions disallowing or limiting early surrenders, including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements.Deposits to investment only products are predominantly in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new deposits can fluctuate from one fiscal quarter to another. The amounts earned by us are derived in part from the difference between the investment income earned by us and the amount credited to the customer. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting the contractual promises.Markets and DistributionFunding agreements are issued directly to non-qualified institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (\u201cFHLB Des Moines\u201d) and unconsolidated special purpose entities. As part of our funding agreement-backed note programs, U.S. and foreign institutional investors purchase debt obligations from the special purpose entity which, in turn, purchases the funding agreement from us with terms similar to those of the debt obligations. The strength of this market is dependent on debt capital market conditions. As a result, our sales through this channel can vary widely from one quarter to another.Pension Risk TransferProductsPension risk transfer products respond primarily to the needs of pension plan sponsors in the form of single premium group annuities, which are immediate or deferred annuities that provide a current or future specific income amount, fully guaranteed by us. The majority of our business originates from defined benefit plans that are being terminated. In these situations, the plan sponsor transfers all its obligations under the plan to an insurer by paying a single premium. Generally, plan sponsors restrict their purchases to insurance companies with superior or excellent financial quality ratings because the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) has mandated that annuities be purchased only from the \u201csafest available\u201d insurers.Since premium received from pension risk transfer products is generally in the form of single payments, the level of premiums can fluctuate depending on the number of large-scale annuity sales in a particular quarter. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting pension risk transfer account values.Markets and DistributionOur primary distribution channel for pension risk transfer products is comprised of several specialized home office sales consultants working through consultants and brokers that specialize in this type of business. Our sales consultants also make sales directly to institutions. Our nationally dispersed retirement services sales representatives act as a secondary distribution channel for these products.Banking ServicesPrincipal Bank is a U.S. federal savings bank that was formed in February 1998.

The rate of return can be a floating rate based on an external market index or a fixed rate. Our investment only products contain provisions disallowing or limiting early surrenders, including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements.Deposits to investment only products are predominantly in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new deposits can fluctuate from one fiscal quarter to another. The amounts earned by us are derived in part from the difference between the investment income earned by us and the amount credited to the customer. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting the contractual promises.Markets and DistributionFunding agreements are issued directly to non-qualified institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (\u201cFHLB Des Moines\u201d) and unconsolidated special purpose entities. As part of our funding agreement-backed note programs, U.S. and foreign institutional investors purchase debt obligations from the special purpose entity which, in turn, purchases the funding agreement from us with terms similar to those of the debt obligations. The strength of this market is dependent on debt capital market conditions. As a result, our sales through this channel can vary widely from one quarter to another.Pension Risk TransferProductsPension risk transfer products respond primarily to the needs of pension plan sponsors in the form of single premium group annuities, which are immediate or deferred annuities that provide a current or future specific income amount, fully guaranteed by us. The majority of our business originates from defined benefit plans that are being terminated. In these situations, the plan sponsor transfers all its obligations under the plan to an insurer by paying a single premium. Generally, plan sponsors restrict their purchases to insurance companies with superior or excellent financial quality ratings because the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) has mandated that annuities be purchased only from the \u201csafest available\u201d insurers.Since premium received from pension risk transfer products is generally in the form of single payments, the level of premiums can fluctuate depending on the number of large-scale annuity sales in a particular quarter. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting pension risk transfer account values.Markets and DistributionOur primary distribution channel for pension risk transfer products is comprised of several specialized home office sales consultants working through consultants and brokers that specialize in this type of business.

However, because it is the holding company for all of our operations, it is subject to regulation in connection with our regulated entities, including as an insurance holding company. We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable to public companies, including public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting and corporate governance.U.S. Insurance Laws and RegulationsWe are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance companies are domiciled. Principal Life and PNLIC are domiciled in Iowa and their principal insurance regulatory authority is the Insurance Division of the Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company\u2019s state of domicile and to furnish financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company system. Transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and at arm\u2019s length.

We monitor a variety of risk metrics on an ongoing basis and take the appropriate steps to manage our established risk appetites and tolerances. Quarterly risk reporting provides a feedback loop between business units, functional areas, our internal risk committees and the enterprise risk management function. This reporting also includes perspectives on emerging risk. To the extent potentially significant business activities or operational initiatives are considered, analysis of the possible impact on our risk profile takes place. This analysis includes, but is not limited to, the capital implications; the impact on near term and long-term earnings; the ability to meet our targets with respect to return on equity, liquidity, debt/capital, cash coverage, business risk and operational risk; and the impact to our reputation.Human CapitalAs of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 19,300 people across the globe. Our employees work from many locations across multiple businesses and are united behind a common purpose: to help more people and businesses around the globe gain greater access to financial security. We start by listening to our customers to understand their needs, goals and barriers. From there, we leverage our global expertise to provide the guidance, products and experiences to create opportunities for more people to save, invest and protect their financial futures. Our purpose serves as a foundation for attracting, retaining and developing a workforce motivated by quality employment and purposeful work.In 2022 we continued to acquire top talent amid a tight labor market. Our flexible work arrangements allowed leaders access to diverse, global talent. We have a long history of supporting employees\u2019 work arrangement needs; and, as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to offer flexibility to our teams. We are clear that our top priorities remain the needs of our customers and our business, and we rely on our leadership community to manage the flexibility and work arrangements of our global workforce while effectively enabling these top priorities.We invest in the growth and development of our employees in a variety of ways, including through experiential learning, relationships with colleagues, formal programming and just-in-time resources. We curate learning content that aligns with enterprise priorities to ensure employees have the skills necessary to contribute to our success now and into the future. These investments also make certain that our employees can develop the skills most critical to their current and future career aspirations. We continue to pilot new programs that help onboard new hires and enable all our employees to navigate their career. Additional targeted development opportunities exist for leaders and employees identified as high potential talent. We know a diverse workforce and inclusive culture make us stronger, which is why we strive to provide a work environment where every employee feels welcomed, respected and has an opportunity to thrive. We are committed to providing our leaders across the globe with regular implicit bias and inclusive leadership training, with the goal of establishing better-connected teams and enabling thoughtful decision-making. As of December 31, 2022, we had 9 employee resource groups (\u201cERGs\u201d), comprised of employees motivated to listen, reflect and provide cultural insights. Our ERGs play an integral role in creating an inclusive workplace. In 2022, our global mentoring program entered its third year, enabling colleagues from around the world to build relationships, encourage and educate each other. In addition, we held our first Global Inclusion Summit, at which senior executives and employees hosted sessions on a variety of inclusion-related topics. Internally, we measure the progress of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in multiple ways, including through a Diversity Index comprised of predominantly objective metrics. We also survey employees about their sense of belonging and report the results through our Global People Inclusion Index. The results of our Diversity Index and Global People Inclusion Index help us to measure company-wide performance. In 2022, we continued to partner with an external consultant to conduct an annual, global pay equity study; we believe the results of this study place us in a best-in-class category as compared to financial services industry peers. 18 Table of Contents Table of Contents Internal Audit provides independent, risk-based and objective assurance and advice designed to add value and improve our operations.

We continuously strive to evolve our human capital policies and processes. To better understand and improve upon talent trends, in 2022 we implemented a single, people scorecard, where we report employee data on retention, learning, hiring, engagement and productivity. We also piloted company-wide exit surveys for employees and leaders, enabling us to better understand turnover trends and rationale. Leaders conducted proactive employee stay conversations and quarterly performance check-ins. In addition, we actively monitored our Engagement Index, which is a clear indicator of employee engagement across the organization. These tools allowed us to gather insights and create actions to manage turnover, including through tailored development opportunities and compensation increases for roles in high demand. As of December 31, 2022, for our global employee population the average tenure was 9.3 years and the annual turnover rate was 20.9%. As of December 31, 2022, for our U.S. employees only, the average tenure was 12.1 years and the annual turnover rate was 13.0%.

The programs for the broader employee population include our employee stock purchase plan and our annual incentive program. For select roles, we offer a long-term incentive plan, which is a stock-based compensation plan. Critical talent and high performing employees are eligible to receive stock awards under our discretionary stock program. Retirement programming for U.S. employees includes eligibility for our 401(k) plan, with a robust company match. Additionally, employees outside our asset management business are eligible to participate in a cash balance defined benefit plan. Outside of the U.S., retirement programming varies by country but commonly exceeds statutory requirements. We also offer employees a comprehensive suite of health and welfare benefits, designed to support them through all stages of their career and life. We put a special emphasis on employee wellbeing by offering a wide range of programming aimed at improving overall health, including a state-of-the-art wellness center at our global headquarters and gym reimbursement at other locations. In addition to providing competitive total rewards, we provide our global workforce a myriad of opportunities to support their communities and causes that are important to them. We encourage in-person and virtual volunteerism through our volunteer time off policy. As an example of this, in 2022, employees helped map areas most vulnerable to natural disasters to improve and increase humanitarian aid at times of crisis. In addition, our teams logged significant miles walking, running and rolling to raise money for global disaster relief organizations. At the Community Learning Center housed at our global headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa, employees have ready access to a variety of volunteer opportunities, including the ability to mentor students, provide professional development coaching and teach technology and coding skills.

Risk FactorsSummary of Risk FactorsThis section provides a summary of the risks that may impact our performance in the future. For details of our various risk factors and their impacts, see \u201cRisk Factors Discussion.\u201d Our risk factors are organized into the following categories: 1) Risks relating to economic conditions, market conditions and investments, 2) Risks relating to estimates, assumptions and valuations, 3) Risks relating to laws, regulations and taxation, 4) Risks relating to our business and 5) General risks.Risks relating to economic conditions, market conditions and investmentsIn general, economic and market conditions can cause variability in the following factors: demand for our products and services, short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation and deflation, equity returns, credit spreads, liquidity of investments, level of premiums and deposits, level of delinquencies and defaults, level of claims, level of surrenders and withdrawals and foreign exchange rates. The net effect of this variability can include reductions in business volumes or AUM, reductions in revenues, additional operating expenses, reductions or volatility in net income, inability to meet liquidity needs, inability to access capital and increased cost of capital. Risks relating to estimates, assumptions and valuationsWe use financial models to price our products, calculate reserves and other actuarial balances, value our investments and determine the amount of allowances or impairments taken on our investments. These models include the use of methodologies, assumptions and estimates. If actual experience is different than our models, our financial results could be impacted. This could impact the timing of our net income or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 20 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bU.S. (1)\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bSenior\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Employees\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Management\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Management\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EMG\u200bAsian\u00a0 4%\u00a0\u00a0 3%\u00a0\u00a0 9%\u00a0\u00a0 9%Black\u00a0 5\u00a0 2\u200b \u2014\u00a0 9\u200bLatino\u00a0 4\u00a0 2\u200b \u2014\u00a0 \u2014\u200bWhite\u00a0 85\u00a0 92\u200b 82\u00a0 82\u200bAll other races\u200b 2\u200b 1\u200b 9\u200b \u2014\u200b(1)Reporting on racial diversity is more nuanced, and in many cases, not disclosed outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 7,200 Employees, approximately 1,000 people in Management, no people in Senior Management and 2 EMG members were based outside the U.S.The following table provides demographic data for the Directors on the PFG Board of Directors as of December 31, 2022.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Board\u00a0of\u00a0Directors\u00a0Female\u200b 38%  Male\u00a0 62\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bBlack\u00a0 15%  Latino\u00a0 15\u200bWhite\u00a0 70\u200b\u200bInternet WebsiteOur internet website can be found at www.principal.com.
