BUSINESS  GENERAL Ameren, formed in 1997 and headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company whose primary assets are its equity interests in its subsidiaries. Ameren\u2019s subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. Dividends on Ameren\u2019s common stock and the payment of expenses by Ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. 6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Below is a summary description of Ameren\u2019s principal subsidiaries \u2013 Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. Ameren also has other subsidiaries that conduct other activities, such as providing shared services. A more detailed description can be found in Note\u00a01\u00a0\u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08, of this report. \u2022Ameren Missouri operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution business and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution business in Missouri. \u2022Ameren Illinois operates rate-regulated electric transmission, electric distribution, and natural gas distribution businesses in Illinois. \u2022ATXI operates a FERC rate-regulated electric transmission business in the MISO. For additional information about the development of our businesses, our business operations, and factors affecting our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, see Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07, and Note\u00a01\u00a0\u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note\u00a02\u00a0\u2013 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08, of this report.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS Ameren has four segments: Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Transmission. The Ameren Missouri segment includes all of the operations of Ameren Missouri. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution consists of the electric distribution business of Ameren Illinois. Ameren Illinois Natural Gas consists of the natural gas business of Ameren Illinois. Ameren Transmission primarily consists of the aggregated electric transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI. Ameren Missouri has one segment. Ameren Illinois has three segments: Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Illinois Transmission. An illustration of the Ameren Companies\u2019 reporting structures is provided below:  (a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ameren Transmission segment also includes allocated Ameren (parent) interest charges, as well as other subsidiaries engaged in electric transmission project development and investment.  RATES AND REGULATION Rates The rates that Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are allowed to charge for their utility services significantly influence the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of these companies and Ameren. The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated. The utility rates charged to customers are determined by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC.  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, customer intervention, and economic conditions, as well as social and political views. Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding customer rates are largely outside of our control. These decisions, as well as the regulatory lag involved in the process of obtaining approval for new customer rates, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Ameren Companies. The extent of the regulatory lag varies for each of Ameren\u2019s electric and natural gas jurisdictions, with the Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution businesses experiencing the least amount of regulatory lag. Depending on the jurisdiction, the effects of regulatory lag are mitigated by various means, including annual revenue requirement reconciliations, the decoupling of revenues from sales volumes to ensure revenues approved in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes, the recovery of certain capital investments between traditional regulatory rate reviews, the level and timing of expenditures, the use of future test years to establish customer rates, and the use of trackers and riders. The MoPSC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Missouri. The ICC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Illinois. The MoPSC and the ICC regulate non-rate utility matters for ATXI. ATXI does not have retail distribution customers; therefore, the MoPSC and the ICC do not have authority to regulate ATXI\u2019s rates. The FERC regulates Ameren Missouri\u2019s, Ameren Illinois\u2019, and ATXI\u2019s cost-based rates for the wholesale transmission and distribution of energy in interstate commerce and various other matters discussed below under General Regulatory Matters. For additional information on Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI rate matters, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07A, and Note\u00a02\u00a0\u2013 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08, of this report. The following table summarizes the key terms of the rate orders in effect for customer billings for each of Ameren\u2019s rate-regulated utilities as of January\u00a01, 2023, except as noted: Rate RegulatorEffectiveRate OrderIssued InAllowedROEPercent ofCommon EquityRate Base(in billions)Portion of Ameren\u2019s 2022 Operating Revenues(a)Ameren MissouriElectric service(b)MoPSCDecember 2021(c)(c)(c)$10.2(d)48%Natural gas delivery serviceMoPSCDecember 2021(e)(e)(e)$0.33%Ameren IllinoisElectric distribution delivery service(f)ICCDecember 20227.85%50.00%$3.928%Natural gas delivery service(g)ICCJanuary 20219.67%52.00%$2.115%Electric transmission service(h)FERC(h)10.52%54.48%$3.44%ATXIElectric transmission service(h)FERC(h)10.52%60.16%$1.32% Portion of Ameren\u2019s 2022 Operating Revenues(a) Electric service(b) December 2021(c) $10.2(d) December 2021(e) Electric distribution delivery service(f) Natural gas delivery service(g) Electric transmission service(h) Electric transmission service(h) (a)Includes pass-through costs recovered from customers, such as purchased power for electric distribution delivery service and natural gas purchased for resale for natural gas delivery service, and intercompany eliminations. (b)Ameren Missouri\u2019s electric generation, transmission, and delivery service rates are bundled together and charged to retail customers under a combined electric service rate. Because the bundled rates charged to MoPSC retail customers include the revenue requirement associated with Ameren Missouri's FERC-regulated transmission services, the table above does not separately reflect a FERC-authorized rate base or allowed ROE. (c)This rate order did not specify an ROE, but specified that Ameren Missouri\u2019s September 30, 2021 capital structure, which was composed of 51.97% common equity, is to be used in the PISA and RESRAM. As a result of this order, new rates became effective in February 2022. (d)Excludes PISA and RESRAM deferrals for investments after September 30, 2021. Deferrals after September 30, 2021, through December 31, 2022, will be included in Ameren Missouri\u2019s requested rate base in the 2022 electric service regulatory rate review. (e)This rate order did not specify an ROE or a capital structure. As a result of this order, new rates became effective in February 2022. (f)Ameren Illinois electric distribution delivery service rates are updated annually and become effective each January. This rate order was based on 2021 actual costs, expected net plant additions for 2022, and the annual average of the monthly yields during 2021 of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points, which was 2.05%. Ameren Illinois\u2019 2023 electric distribution delivery service revenues will be based on its 2023 actual recoverable costs, rate base, common equity percentage, and an allowed ROE, as calculated under the IEIMA\u2019s performance-based formula ratemaking framework. (g)This rate order was based on a 2021 future test year, and new rates became effective in January 2021. (h)Transmission rates are updated annually and become effective each January. They are determined by a company-specific, forward-looking formula ratemaking framework based on each year\u2019s forecasted information. The 10.52% return, which includes a 50 basis points incentive adder for participation in an RTO, is based on the FERC\u2019s May\u00a02020 order. For additional information regarding this order and an August 2022 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit related to a review of the May 2020 order, see Note\u00a02\u00a0\u2013 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08, of this report. General Regulatory Matters Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive FERC approval to enter into various transactions, such as issuing short-term debt securities and conducting certain acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations involving electric utility holding companies. In addition, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive authorization from the applicable state public utility regulatory agency to issue stock and long-term debt securities and to conduct mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other activities. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are also subject to mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards adopted by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the bulk electric power system. These standards are developed and enforced by the NERC, pursuant to authority delegated to it by the FERC. Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are members of the SERC. The SERC is one of six regional entities and represents all or portions of 16 central and southeastern states under authority from the NERC for the purpose of implementing and enforcing reliability standards approved by the FERC. Ameren Missouri is also a member of the MRO, which is also one of the six regional entities and represents all or portions of 16 central, southern, and midwestern states, as well as two Canadian provinces, under authority from the NERC. The regional entities of the NERC work to safeguard the reliability of the bulk power systems throughout North America. If any of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, or ATXI is found not to be in compliance with these mandatory reliability standards, it could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions. Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, the FERC and the state public utility regulatory agencies in each state Ameren and its subsidiaries operate in may access books and records of Ameren and its subsidiaries that are found to be relevant to costs incurred by Ameren\u2019s rate-regulated subsidiaries that may affect jurisdictional rates. The act also permits the MoPSC and the ICC to request that the FERC review cost allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren subsidiaries. Operation of Ameren Missouri\u2019s Callaway Energy Center is subject to regulation by the NRC. The license for the Callaway Energy Center expires in 2044. Ameren Missouri\u2019s hydroelectric Osage Energy Center and pumped-storage hydroelectric Taum Sauk Energy Center, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to FERC regulations affecting, among other aspects, the general operation and maintenance of the projects. The licenses for the Osage Energy Center and the Taum Sauk Energy Center expire in 2047 and 2044, respectively. Ameren Missouri\u2019s Keokuk Energy Center and its dam on the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated under authority granted by an Act of Congress in 1905. For additional information on regulatory matters, see Note\u00a02\u00a0\u2013 Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note\u00a09\u00a0\u2013 Callaway Energy Center, and Note\u00a014\u00a0\u2013 Commitments and Contingencies under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08, of this report. Environmental Matters Our electric generation, transmission, and distribution and natural gas distribution and storage operations must comply with a variety of statutes and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety. These environmental statutes and regulations are comprehensive and include the storage, handling, and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances, emergency planning and response requirements, limitations and standards applicable to discharges from our facilities into the air or water that are enforced through permitting requirements, and wildlife protection laws, including those related to endangered species. Federal and state authorities continually revise these regulations and adopt new regulations, which may impact our planning process and the ultimate implementation of these or other new or revised regulations. For discussion of environmental matters, including NOx and SO2 emission reduction requirements, regulation of CO2 emissions, wastewater discharge standards, remediation efforts, CCR management regulations, and a discussion of litigation against Ameren Missouri with respect to NSR, the Clean Air Act, and Missouri law in connection with projects at Ameren Missouri\u2019s Rush Island Energy Center, see Note\u00a014\u00a0\u2013 Commitments and Contingencies under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08, of this report.  TRANSMISSION Ameren owns an integrated transmission system that is composed of the transmission assets of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. Ameren also operates two MISO balancing authority areas: AMMO and AMIL. The AMMO balancing authority area includes the load and most energy centers of Ameren Missouri, and had a peak demand of 7,584 MWs in 2022. The AMIL balancing authority area includes the load of Ameren Illinois and certain natural gas-fired energy centers of Ameren Missouri, and had a peak demand of 8,510 MWs in 2022. The Ameren transmission system directly connects with 15 other balancing authority areas for the exchange of electric energy. Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are transmission-owning members of the MISO. Ameren Missouri is authorized by the MoPSC to participate in the MISO for an indefinite term, subject to the MoPSC\u2019s authority to require future proceedings if an event or circumstance occurs that significantly affects Ameren Missouri\u2019s position in the MISO. Ameren Illinois\u2019 election to participate in the MISO is subject to the ICC\u2019s oversight. In July 2022, the ICC issued an order requiring Ameren Illinois to perform a cost-benefit study of continued participation in the MISO compared to participation in PJM Interconnection LLC, another RTO, and file the study by July 2023. For additional information regarding the July 2022 ICC order, see Note\u00a02\u00a0\u2013 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08, of this report. 9 9 9  Table of Contents Table of Contents SUPPLY OF ELECTRIC POWER Capacity Ameren Missouri sells nearly all of its capacity to the MISO and purchases the capacity it needs to supply its native load sales from the MISO. In the April 2022 MISO capacity auction, Ameren Missouri\u2019s generation resources exceeded its native load capacity requirements. Ameren Illinois purchases capacity from the MISO and through bilateral contracts resulting from IPA procurement events. In August 2022, the FERC issued an order approving changes to the annual MISO capacity auction. Historically, the auctions were designed to cover annual peak demand plus a target reserve margin. Beginning with the April 2023 auction for the June 2023 to May 2024 planning year, auctions will include four seasonal load forecasts and available capacity levels and will be designed to cover each season\u2019s peak demand plus a target reserve margin. The seasonal auction structure will help to address variability in resources as the MISO begins to rely more heavily on renewable generation. Ameren Missouri Ameren Missouri\u2019s electric supply is primarily generated from its energy centers. Factors that could cause Ameren Missouri to purchase power include, among other things, energy center outages, the fulfillment of renewable energy requirements, extreme weather conditions, the availability of power at a cost lower than its generation cost, and the lack of sufficient owned generation availability. Ameren Missouri files a long-term nonbinding integrated resource plan with the MoPSC every three years. The most recent integrated resource plan was filed in September 2020 and changed in June 2022 to include certain modifications to Ameren Missouri\u2019s preferred approach for meeting customers\u2019 projected long-term energy needs in a cost-effective manner while maintaining system reliability and customer affordability. The preferred approach includes, among other things, the following: \u2022the continued implementation of customer energy-efficiency programs; \u2022expanding renewable sources by adding 2,800 MWs of renewable generation by 2030 and a total of 4,700 MWs of renewable generation by 2040, representing investment opportunities of $7.5 billion, inclusive of the 350\u00a0MWs of solar generation projects discussed in Note 2 \u2013 Rates and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report; \u2022adding 800 MWs of battery storage by 2040, representing investment opportunities of $650 million; \u2022adding 1,200\u00a0MWs of natural gas-fired combined cycle generation by 2031, representing an investment opportunity of $1.7 billion, with plans to switch to hydrogen fuel and/or blend hydrogen fuel with natural gas and install carbon capture technology if these technologies become commercially available at a reasonable cost; \u2022adding 1,200 MWs of additional clean dispatchable generation by 2043; \u2022the expectation that Ameren Missouri will seek and receive NRC approval for an extension of the operating license for the Callaway Energy Center beyond its current 2044 expiration date; \u2022extending the retirement date of the coal-fired Sioux Energy Center from 2028 to 2030 to ensure reliability during the transition to clean energy generation, which is subject to the approval of a change in the asset\u2019s depreciable life by the MoPSC in Ameren Missouri\u2019s 2022 electric service regulatory rate review; \u2022accelerating the retirement date of the Rush Island coal-fired energy center to 2025; \u2022retiring the remaining coal-fired energy centers as they reach the end of their useful lives; \u2022accelerating the retirement date of the Venice natural gas-fired energy center to 2029; and \u2022retiring Ameren Missouri\u2019s other natural gas-fired energy centers in Illinois by 2040. The addition of renewable and natural gas-fired combined cycle generation facilities is subject to obtaining necessary project approvals, including FERC approval and the issuance of a certificate of convenience and necessity by the MoPSC, as applicable. Ameren Missouri would be adversely affected if the MoPSC does not allow recovery of the remaining investment and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of an energy center, as well as the ability to earn a return on that remaining investment and those decommissioning costs. In connection with the planned accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center, Ameren Missouri expects to seek approval from the MoPSC to finance the costs associated with the retirement, including the remaining unrecovered net plant balance associated with the facility, through the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds pursuant to the Missouri securitization statute. The next integrated resource plan is expected to be filed in September 2023. Ameren Missouri continues to evaluate its longer-term needs for new generating capacity. The need for investment in new sources of energy is dependent on several key factors, including continuation of and customer participation in energy-efficiency programs, the amount of distributed generation from customers, load growth, technological advancements, costs of generation alternatives, environmental regulation of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants, and state renewable energy requirements, which could lead to the retirement of current baseload assets before the end of their current useful lives or alterations in the way those assets operate, which could result in increased capital expenditures and/or increased operations and maintenance expenses. Because of the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload energy center, Ameren Missouri continues to study alternatives and to take steps to preserve options to meet future demand. Steps include evaluating the potential for further diversification of Ameren Missouri\u2019s generation portfolio through  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents renewable energy generation, including wind and solar generation, natural gas-fired combined cycle generation, including the potential to switch to hydrogen fuel and/or blend hydrogen fuel with natural gas and install carbon capture technology, extending the operating license for the Callaway Energy Center, additional customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs, distributed energy resources, and energy storage. Missouri law requires Ameren Missouri to offer solar rebates and net metering to certain customers that install renewable generation at their premises. The difference between the cost of the rebates and the amount set in base rates are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability under the RESRAM, and earn carrying costs at short-term interest rates. Customers that elect to enroll in net metering are allowed to net their generation against their usage within each billing month. Ameren Illinois In Illinois, while electric transmission and distribution service rates are regulated, power supply prices are not. Although electric customers are allowed to purchase power from an alternative retail electric supplier, Ameren Illinois is required to be the provider of last resort for its electric distribution customers. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, Ameren Illinois procured power on behalf of its customers for 28%, 23%, and 23%, respectively, of its total kilowatthour sales. Power purchased by Ameren Illinois for its electric distribution customers who do not elect to purchase their power from an alternative retail electric supplier comes either through procurement processes conducted by the IPA or through markets operated by the MISO. The IPA administers an RFP process through which Ameren Illinois procures its expected supply. The purchased power and related procurement costs incurred by Ameren Illinois are passed directly to its electric distribution customers through a cost recovery mechanism. Transmission costs are charged to customers who purchase electricity from Ameren Illinois and to alternative retail electric suppliers through a cost recovery mechanism. The purchased power, power procurement, and transmission costs are reflected in Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution\u2019s results of operations, but do not affect Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution\u2019s earnings because these costs are offset by corresponding revenues. Ameren Illinois charges distribution service rates to electric distribution customers who purchase electricity, regardless of supplier, which does affect Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution\u2019s earnings. Pursuant to the IETL, Ameren Illinois is required to file a multi-year integrated grid plan with the ICC every four years. In January 2023, Ameren Illinois filed its first multi-year integrated grid plan for the years 2023 to 2027. The plan outlines how Ameren Illinois expects to operate and invest in electric distribution infrastructure in order to support grid modernization, clean energy, energy efficiency, and the state of Illinois\u2019 renewable energy, equity, climate, electrification, and environmental goals, while providing safe, secure, reliable, and resilient electric distribution service to customers. Ameren Illinois\u2019 next multi-year integrated grid plan is required by mid-January 2026. Illinois law requires Ameren Illinois to offer rebates and net metering to certain customers that install renewable generation or paired energy storage systems at their premises. The cost of the rebates are deferred as a regulatory asset, which earn a return at the applicable WACC. Customers that elect to receive a generation rebate and are enrolled in net metering are allowed to net their supply service charges, but not their distribution service charges. Effective January 2023, customers that elect to receive energy storage rebates and have not received generation rebates are allowed to net their supply and distribution service charges. By law, Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric distribution revenues are decoupled from sales volumes, which ensures that the electric distribution revenues authorized in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes.  POWER GENERATION Ameren Missouri owns energy centers that rely on a diverse fuel portfolio, including coal, nuclear, and natural gas, as well as renewable sources of generation, which include hydroelectric, wind, methane gas, and solar. All of Ameren Missouri\u2019s coal-fired energy centers were constructed prior to 1978. The Callaway Energy Center began operation in 1984 and is licensed to operate until 2044. As of December\u00a031, 2022, Ameren Missouri\u2019s coal-fired energy centers represented 9% and 17% of Ameren\u2019s and Ameren Missouri\u2019s rate base, respectively. The Meramec Energy Center was retired at the end of its useful life in December 2022. Also in December 2022, Ameren Illinois placed a solar generation facility in service, which is one of two pilot solar projects Ameren Illinois is allowed to invest in under the IETL. See Item\u00a02\u00a0\u2013 Properties under Part\u00a0I of this report for information regarding our energy centers. Coal Ameren Missouri has an ongoing need for coal as fuel for generation, and pursues a price-hedging strategy consistent with this requirement. Ameren Missouri has agreements in place to purchase and transport coal to its energy centers. While Ameren Missouri has minimum purchase obligations associated with these agreements, the majority of these agreements are not associated with any specific coal-fired energy center. Ameren Missouri burned approximately 14.5 million tons of coal in 2022. For information regarding the percentages of Ameren Missouri\u2019s projected required supply of coal and coal transportation that are price-hedged through 2027, see Commodity Price Risk under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07A, of this report. About 97% of Ameren Missouri\u2019s coal is purchased from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, which has a limited number of suppliers. The remaining coal is typically purchased from the Illinois Basin. Targeted coal inventory levels may be adjusted because of generation levels  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents or uncertainties of supply due to potential work stoppages, delays in coal deliveries, equipment breakdowns, and other factors. Deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail congestion, staffing and equipment issues, infrastructure maintenance, derailments, weather, and supplier financial hardship. Coal suppliers in the Powder River Basin are experiencing financial hardship because of a decrease in demand resulting from increased natural gas use and renewable energy generation, and the impact of environmental regulations and concerns related to coal-fired generation. These financial hardships have resulted in bankruptcy filings by certain coal suppliers in recent years. As of December\u00a031, 2022, coal inventories at the Labadie and Sioux energy centers were below targeted levels due to transportation delays in 2022. Delays and disruptions in coal deliveries could cause Ameren Missouri to pursue a strategy that could include reducing off-system sales of power during low-margin periods, buying higher-cost fuels to generate required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources. Nuclear The production of nuclear fuel involves the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas, the enrichment of that gas, the conversion of the enriched uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium dioxide fuel pellets, and the fabrication into fuel assemblies. Ameren Missouri has entered into uranium, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment, and fabrication contracts to procure the fuel supply for its Callaway Energy Center. The Callaway Energy Center requires refueling at 18-month intervals. The last refueling was completed in May 2022. The next refueling is scheduled for the fall of 2023. Ameren Missouri has inventories and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium (concentrate and hexafluoride), conversion, enrichment, and fabrication requirements at least through the 2026 refueling.  RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ZERO EMISSION STANDARDS Missouri and Illinois laws require electric utilities to include renewable energy resources in their portfolios. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois satisfied their renewable energy portfolio requirements in 2022. Ameren Missouri In Missouri, utilities are required to purchase or generate electricity equal to at least 15% of native load sales from renewable energy sources, with at least 2% of the requirement derived from solar energy. The requirement is subject to an average 1% annual increase on customer rates over any 10-year period. For renewable generation facilities located in Missouri, 125% of the electricity generated counts towards meeting the requirement. Ameren Missouri expects to satisfy the nonsolar requirement in 2023 with its High Prairie Renewable, Atchison Renewable, Keokuk, and Maryland Heights energy centers, a 102-MW power purchase agreement with a wind farm operator, and immaterial renewable energy credit purchases in the market. The High Prairie Renewable and Atchison Renewable energy centers are wind generation facilities. The Keokuk Energy Center generates electricity using a hydroelectric dam located on the Mississippi River. The Maryland Heights Energy Center generates electricity by burning methane gas collected from a landfill. Ameren Missouri is meeting the solar energy requirement by purchasing solar-generated renewable energy credits from customer-installed systems and by generating energy at its solar facilities. Ameren Illinois In accordance with Illinois law, Ameren Illinois is required to collect funds from all electric distribution customers to fund IPA procurement events for renewable energy credits. The amount set by law and required to be collected from customers by Ameren Illinois is capped at $4.58 per MWh. The IPA establishes its long-term renewable resources procurement plans in a filing made every two years. In July 2022, the ICC approved the IPA\u2019s latest long-term renewable resources procurement plan. Based on IPA procurement events that align with the IPA\u2019s plan, Ameren Illinois has contractual commitments of approximately 0.7 million wind renewable energy credits per year and approximately 1.7 million solar renewable energy credits per year. Ameren Illinois has also entered into contracts, ending in 2032, to purchase approximately 0.6 million wind renewable energy credits per year. Pursuant to the IETL, if funds collected from customers are not used to procure renewable energy credits, they would be refunded to customers pursuant to a reconciliation proceeding, the first of which is expected to be initiated after August\u00a02023. Based on amounts collected from customers and renewable energy credit purchases under contract, Ameren Illinois does not expect the first reconciliation proceeding to result in refunds to customers. The IPA is expected to file its next long-term renewable resources procurement plan in 2023, which, once approved by the ICC, will establish the 2023 and 2024 renewable energy credit procurement targets. 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents Illinois law also required Ameren Illinois to enter into contracts for zero emission credits in an amount equal to approximately 16% of the actual amount of electricity delivered to retail customers during calendar year 2014, pursuant to Illinois\u2019 zero emission standard. As a result of a 2018 IPA procurement event, which was approved by the ICC, Ameren Illinois entered into agreements to acquire zero emission credits through May 2027. Annual zero emission credit commitment amounts will be published by the IPA each May prior to the start of the subsequent planning year. Both renewable energy credits and zero emission credits have cost recovery mechanisms, which allow Ameren Illinois to collect from, or refund to, customers differences between actual costs incurred from the resulting contracts and the amounts collected from customers.  CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois have implemented energy-efficiency programs to educate their customers and to help them become more efficient energy consumers. These programs provide incentives to customers for installing newer, more efficient technology, and for using energy in a more conservation-minded manner. As a component of the energy-efficiency programs, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois have invested in electric smart meters to provide customers more visibility to their energy consumption and facilitate more efficient use of energy. As of December 31, 2022, smart meters have been installed for 61% of Ameren Missouri\u2019s electric customers. Ameren Illinois has completed its transition to smart meters, which have been installed for nearly all its electric and natural gas customers. Ameren Missouri In Missouri, the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act established a rider that, among other things, allows electric utilities to recover costs with respect to MoPSC-approved customer energy-efficiency programs. The law requires the MoPSC to ensure that a utility\u2019s financial incentives are aligned to help customers use energy more efficiently, to provide timely cost recovery, and to provide earnings opportunities associated with cost-effective energy-efficiency programs. Missouri does not have a law mandating energy-efficiency programs. In 2018, the MoPSC issued an order approving Ameren Missouri\u2019s MEEIA 2019 plan. The plan includes a portfolio of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs through December\u00a02023. Ameren Missouri intends to invest approximately $350 million over the life of the plan, including $75\u00a0million in 2023. In addition, the plan includes a performance incentive that provides Ameren Missouri an opportunity to earn additional revenues by achieving certain customer energy-efficiency goals. If the target spending goals are achieved for 2023, additional revenues of $13\u00a0million would be recognized in 2023. Through 2022, Ameren Missouri has invested approximately $270\u00a0million in MEEIA 2019 customer energy-efficiency programs. Additionally, as part of its Smart Energy Plan, Ameren Missouri has invested $270\u00a0million in smart meters since 2019. The MEEIA 2019 plan includes the continued use of the MEEIA rider. The MEEIA rider allows Ameren Missouri to collect from, or refund to, customers any difference between actual program costs, lost electric margins, and any performance incentive and the amounts collected from customers, without a traditional regulatory rate review, subject to MoPSC prudence reviews, until lower volumes resulting from the MEEIA programs are reflected in base rates. Customer rates, based upon both forecasted program costs and lost electric margins and collected via the MEEIA rider, are reconciled annually to actual results. Ameren Illinois State law requires Ameren Illinois to offer customer energy-efficiency programs, and imposes electric energy-efficiency savings goals and a maximum annual amount of investment in electric energy-efficiency programs, which is approximately $120 million annually through 2029 and may increase by up to approximately $30\u00a0million from 2026 to 2029 depending on the election of certain customers to participate in the programs. Every four years, Ameren Illinois is required to file a four-year electric energy-efficiency plan with the ICC. In June 2022, the ICC issued an order approving Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric and natural gas energy-efficiency plans for 2022 through 2025, as well as regulatory recovery mechanisms. The order authorized electric and natural gas energy-efficiency program expenditures of $476\u00a0million and $66\u00a0million, respectively, over the four-year period. Illinois law allows Ameren Illinois to earn a return on its electric energy-efficiency program investments. Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric energy-efficiency investments are deferred as a regulatory asset and earn a return at the applicable WACC, with the ROE based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. The allowed ROE on electric energy-efficiency investments can be increased or decreased by up to 200 basis points, depending on the achievement of annual energy savings goals. While the ICC approves Ameren Illinois\u2019 four-year electric energy-efficiency plans, the ICC has the ability to reduce the amount of approved electric energy-efficiency savings goals in future plan program years if there are insufficient cost-effective programs available, which could reduce the investments in electric energy-efficiency programs. The electric energy-efficiency program investments and the return on those investments are collected from customers through a rider and are not included in the electric distribution service performance-based formula ratemaking framework. Ameren Illinois\u2019 natural gas energy-efficiency program costs are recovered through a rider. 13 13 13  Table of Contents Table of Contents NATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR DISTRIBUTION Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are responsible for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to their customers. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois each develop and manage a portfolio of natural gas supply resources. These resources include firm natural gas supply agreements with producers, firm interstate and intrastate transportation capacity, firm no-notice storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines, and on-system storage facilities to maintain natural gas deliveries to customers throughout the year and especially during peak demand periods. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois primarily use Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Mississippi River Transmission Corporation, Northern Border Pipeline Company, and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation interstate pipeline systems to transport natural gas to their systems. In addition to transactions requiring physical delivery, certain financial instruments, including those entered into in the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market and in the over-the-counter financial markets, are used to hedge the price paid for natural gas. Natural gas supply costs are passed on to customers of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois under PGA clauses, subject to prudence reviews by the MoPSC and the ICC. For information regarding the percentage of Ameren Missouri\u2019s and Ameren Illinois\u2019 projected remaining natural gas supply requirements that are price-hedged through 2027, see Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, of this report. For additional information on our fuel, purchased power, and natural gas for distribution supply, see Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07, and Commodity Price Risk under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07A, of this report.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The execution of Ameren\u2019s core strategy to invest in rate-regulated energy infrastructure, enhance regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible policies, and optimize operating performance to capitalize on opportunities to benefit our customers, our shareholders, and the environment is driven by the capabilities and engagement of our workforce. Ameren\u2019s workforce strategy is designed to promote a skilled and diverse workforce that is prepared to deliver on Ameren\u2019s mission (To Power the Quality of Life) and vision (Leading the Way to a Sustainable Energy Future), both today and in the future. Our workforce strategy is anchored in four key pillars: Culture, Leadership, Talent, and Rewards, which are discussed further below. Foundational to our workforce strategy are our core values of: \u2022Safety and security\u2022Commitment to excellence\u2022Respect\u2022Accountability\u2022Diversity, equity, and inclusion\u2022Integrity\u2022Teamwork\u2022Stewardship \u2022Safety and security \u2022Commitment to excellence \u2022Respect \u2022Accountability \u2022Diversity, equity, and inclusion \u2022Integrity \u2022Teamwork \u2022Stewardship Ameren\u2019s chief executive officer and chief human resources officer, with the support of other leaders of the Ameren Companies, are responsible for developing and executing our workforce strategy. In addition to reviewing and determining the Ameren Companies\u2019 compensation practices and policies for the chief executive officer and other executive officers, the Human Resources Committee of Ameren\u2019s board of directors is responsible for oversight of Ameren\u2019s human capital management practices and policies, including those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Human Resources Committee and Ameren\u2019s board of directors are updated regularly on human capital matters. Culture We strive to cultivate a values-based and continuous improvement culture that enables the sustainable execution of our core strategy and reflects the following characteristics: \u2022We Care about our customers, our communities, and each other\u2022We Serve with Passion\u2022We Deliver for our customers and stakeholders, today and tomorrow\u2022We Win Together as a result of our teamwork and collaboration \u2022We Care about our customers, our communities, and each other \u2022We Serve with Passion \u2022We Deliver for our customers and stakeholders, today and tomorrow \u2022We Win Together as a result of our teamwork and collaboration We design our human capital management practices and policies to reinforce our core values, shape our culture, and drive employee engagement. In doing so, we strive to align our employees to our mission and vision, improve safety, enhance innovation, increase productivity, attract and retain top talent, and recognize employee contributions, among other things. We assess employee engagement through a variety of channels. As a part of our assessment, we conduct confidential employee engagement surveys at least annually to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement in our employees\u2019 experience, and take actions aimed at increasing employee engagement. We also capitalized on opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and implemented work-from-home policies, advanced the digital enablement of our workforce, and enhanced our facilities and workforce policies and practices to increase collaboration and productivity. 14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents As a part of our culture, every employee is expected to challenge any unsafe act, complete each workday safely, and provide feedback on safety and security matters. In addition to comprehensive safety and security standards, and mandatory health, safety, and security training programs for applicable employees, we promote programs designed to encourage employees to provide feedback on practices or actions that could harm employees, customers, or the Ameren Companies, including perceived issues related to safety, security (both physical and cyber), ethics and compliance violations, or acts of discrimination. We seek to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion across our organization. We contribute to community-based organizations, hold diversity, equity, and inclusion leadership summits for employees and community leaders, and offer various training programs. We also offer a program to provide paid-time off for employees who engage in volunteer or learning opportunities with organizations that support diversity, equity, and inclusion. We also have employee resource groups, which bring together groups of employees who share common interests or backgrounds. Within these groups, employees collaborate to address concerns and provide training and development opportunities related to challenges or barriers, and offer support for each other, among other things. Leadership Ameren\u2019s leaders play a critical role in setting and executing Ameren\u2019s strategic initiatives, modeling our values and culture, and engaging and enabling the workforce. As such, we seek to develop a strong, diverse leadership team. Management engages in an extensive succession planning process annually, which includes the involvement of Ameren\u2019s board of directors. We develop our leaders both individually, through job rotations, work experiences, and leadership development programs, and as a team, through collaborative learning and mentoring relationships. Throughout the year, we offer a variety of forums intended to connect our leaders to our mission, values, strategy and culture, build leadership skills and capabilities, and to promote connection and inclusion. In addition, we evaluate our organizational structure and make adjustments and expand roles to facilitate execution of our strategy and organizational efficiency. Talent In order to attract and retain a skilled and diverse workforce, we promote an inclusive work environment, provide opportunities for employees to expand their knowledge and skill sets, and support career development. Our talent management initiatives include a wide range of recruiting partnerships and programs, including those programs discussed below. Our onboarding efforts are designed to ensure early engagement, including the opportunity to participate in mentoring programs. Additionally, employees are encouraged to participate in technical, professional, and leadership development opportunities, and outreach initiatives to engage with the communities that we serve, among other things. As our business needs change, we remain focused on ensuring that our workforce has the tools and skills necessary to deliver on our strategic initiatives. We have established programs to recruit early and mid-career talent to further enhance the diversity of our workforce pipelines. These programs include skilled craft education and training for individuals interested in skilled craft roles, an intern/co-op program that serves as a pipeline for STEM-related careers, a career reentry program for experienced professionals transitioning from voluntary career breaks, a program for individuals transitioning from military service, and an early career rotation program. Additionally, each year management and the Human Resources Committee of Ameren\u2019s board of directors review the diversity of our workforce, leadership team, and leadership development pipeline, as well as the actions taken to further enhance the diversity of our leadership team. Workforce The majority of our workforce is comprised of skilled-craft and STEM-related professional and technical employees. Our workforce has been stable, with a total attrition rate of 8% in 2022. The majority of employee attrition is attributable to employee retirements, generally allowing for thoughtful workforce and succession planning in advance of these planned transitions. The following table presents our employee count and their average tenure at December\u00a031, 2022, and the attrition rate in 2022: EmployeeCountAverage Tenure (in years)AttritionRateAmeren9,244138%Ameren Missouri4,039147%Ameren Illinois3,243138%Ameren Services1,9621110% 15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents Ameren\u2019s workforce is diverse in many ways.

The Ameren Illinois collective bargaining unit contracts expire in 2023 and 2026, which cover 8% and 92% of represented employees, respectively. Rewards The primary objective of our rewards program is to provide a total rewards package that attracts and retains a talented workforce and reinforces strong performance in a financially sustainable manner. Management continuously evaluates our core benefits in an effort to create a market-competitive, performance-based, shareholder-aligned total rewards package with a view towards balancing employee value and financial sustainability. We recognize that the rewards package required to attract and retain talent over the long term is about more than pay and benefits; it is about the total employee experience and support of their overall well-being. In addition to base salary, medical benefits, and retirement benefits, including pension for substantially all employees and 401(k) savings, our total rewards package includes short-term incentives and long-term stock-based compensation for certain employees. Further, we offer our employees various programs that encourage overall well-being, including wellness and employee assistance programs. We strive to provide a competitive and sustainable rewards package that supports our ability to attract, engage, and retain a talented and diverse workforce, while at the same time reinforcing and rewarding strong performance.
