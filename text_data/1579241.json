{"cik": 1579241, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS Overview Allegion plc (\"Allegion,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"the Company\") is a leading global provider of security products and solutions that keep people and assets safe and secure in the places they live, learn, work and visit. We create peace of mind by pioneering safety and security with a vision of seamless access and a safer world. Seamless access allows authorized, automated and safe passage and movement through spaces and places in the most efficient and frictionless manner possible. Central to our vision is partnering and developing ecosystems to create a flawless experience and enable an uninterrupted and secure flow of people and assets. We offer an extensive and versatile portfolio of security and access control products and solutions across a range of market-leading brands. Our experts across the globe deliver high-quality security products, services and systems, and we use our deep expertise to serve as trusted partners to end-users who seek customized solutions to their security needs. Allegion Principal Products and ServicesDoor controls and systemsLocks, locksets, portable locks and key systemsExit devicesElectronic security productsSoftware-enabled access control systemsTime, attendance and workforce productivity systemsDoors, accessories and otherServices and software Access control security products and solutions are critical elements in every building and home. Many door openings are configured to maximize a room\u2019s particular form and function while also meeting local and national building and safety code requirements and end-user security needs. Most buildings have multiple door openings, each serving its own purpose and requiring different specific access control solutions. Each door must fit exactly within its frame, be prepared precisely for its hinges, synchronize with its specific lockset and corresponding latch and align with a specific key to secure the door. Moreover, with the increasing adoption of the Internet of Things (\"IoT\"), security products \u2013 including credentials \u2013 are increasingly linked electronically, integrated into software and popular consumer technology platforms and controlled with mobile applications, creating additional functionality and complexity. Seamless access capitalizes on the ability for multiple products and brands to work in tandem, allowing people and assets to move efficiently and safely by adapting access rights for various settings or use cases. These solutions can also provide insights on usage and traffic patterns to boost efficiency, improve hygiene of high-traffic areas and improve visitor, staff and tenant experiences. We believe our ability to deliver a wide range of solutions that can be custom configured to meet end-users\u2019 security needs is a key driver of our success. We accomplish this with:  \u2022Our extensive and versatile product and service portfolio, combined with our deep expertise, which enables us to deliver the right products and solutions to meet diverse security and functional specifications and to successfully and securely integrate into leading technologies and systems;  \u2022Our consultative approach and expertise, which enables us to develop the most efficient and appropriate building security and access control specifications to fulfill the unique needs of our end-users and their partners, including architects, contractors, homebuilders and engineers; \u2022Our access to and management of key channels in the market, which is critical to delivering our products in an efficient and consistent manner; and  \u2022Our enterprise excellence capabilities, including our global manufacturing operations and agile supply chain, which facilitate our ability to deliver specific product and system configurations to end-users and consumers worldwide, quickly and efficiently.  We believe the security products industry will continue to benefit from several global macroeconomic trends, including: \u2022Expected growth in global electronic products and solutions as end-users adopt newer technologies in their facilities and homes; \u2022Heightened awareness of security and privacy requirements; \u2022Increased focus on touchless solutions that help promote a healthy environment; and \u2022The shift to a digital, interconnected environment. We operate in and report financial results for two segments: Allegion Americas and Allegion International, the latter of which provides security products, services and solutions primarily throughout Europe, Asia and Oceania. We sell our products and solutions under the following brands:   4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents    5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents   6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents We sell a wide range of security and access control solutions for end-users in commercial, institutional and residential facilities worldwide, including the education, healthcare, government, hospitality, retail, commercial office and single and multi-family residential markets. Our leading brands include CISA\u00ae, Interflex\u00ae, LCN\u00ae, Schlage\u00ae, SimonsVoss\u00ae and Von Duprin\u00ae. We believe LCN, Schlage and Von Duprin hold the No. 1 or No. 2 position in their primary product categories in North America while CISA, Interflex and SimonsVoss hold the No. 1 or No. 2 position in their primary product categories in certain European markets. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, we generated Net revenues of $3,271.9 million and Operating income of $586.4 million.   History and Developments We were incorporated in Ireland on May 9, 2013, to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of what was then Ingersoll Rand plc (\"Ingersoll Rand\"). On December 1, 2013, we became a stand-alone public company after Ingersoll Rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of Ingersoll Rand via the transfer of these businesses from Ingersoll Rand to us and the issuance by us of ordinary shares directly to Ingersoll Rand\u2019s shareholders (the \"Spin-off\"). Our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories. Several of our brands were established more than 100 years ago, and many originally created their categories:  \u2022Von Duprin, established in 1908, was awarded the first exit device patent; \u2022Schlage, established in 1920, was awarded the first patents granted for the cylindrical lock and the push button lock;  \u2022LCN, established in 1926, created the first door closer;  \u2022CISA, established in 1926, devised the first electronically controlled lock; and \u2022SimonsVoss, established in 1995, created the first keyless digital transponder. We have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN in 1974. Today, we continue to develop, acquire and introduce innovative and market-leading products. For example, in 2022, we acquired Stanley Access Technologies LLC and assets related to the automatic entrance solutions business from Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (the \"Access Technologies business\"), which patented the world's first hands-free door operator in 1931. Through this acquisition, we have added another innovative market leader to our portfolio of businesses and broadened our product and service offerings throughout the U.S. and Canada.    7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents In 2018, we announced the formation of Allegion Ventures to invest in and help accelerate the growth of companies that have innovative, digital-first technologies and products such as touchless access and workspace monitoring solutions that complement our core business solutions. Building on this success, in December 2021, Allegion Ventures announced a second fund with an additional allocation of $100 million to focus on investing in technologies like artificial intelligence, video monitoring, machine learning and cybersecurity.

We expect the security products industry will continue to benefit from favorable trends such as increased concerns about safety and security, new attention on touchless solutions that help promote a healthy environment and technology-driven innovation that enables seamless access and a better user experience as people and assets traverse multiple locations and facilities. Further, we expect continued growth in connected security products and solutions as end-users continue to adopt newer technologies, including IoT, in their facilities and single and multi-family homes. The security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world, with a number of large multi-national companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies. This high degree of fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable end-user needs. We believe our principal global competitors are Assa Abloy AB and dormakaba Group. We also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world, including from Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. in the North American residential market. As we move into more technologically advanced product categories, we may also compete against new, more specialized competitors and technology companies. Our success depends on a variety of factors, including brand and reputation, product breadth, innovation, integration with popular technology platforms, quality and delivery capabilities, price and service capabilities. As many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network. Although price often serves as an important customer decision point, we also compete based on the breadth, innovation and quality of our products and solutions, our ability to custom-configure solutions to meet individual end-user requirements and our global supply chain. Products and Services We offer the following extensive and versatile portfolio of security and access control products and solutions across a range of market-leading brands: \u2022Locks, locksets, portable locks and key systems: A broad array of cylindrical, tubular and mortise door locksets, security levers and master key systems that are used to protect and control access and a range of portable security products, including bicycle, small vehicle and travel locks; \u2022Electronic security products and access control systems: A broad range of electrified locks, electrified door closers and exit devices, access control products and systems, credentials and credential readers and accessories, including IoT, Bluetooth Low Energy, Power over Ethernet and cloud-based solutions; \u2022Time, attendance and workforce productivity systems: These products are designed to help business customers manage and monitor workforce access, attendance and employee scheduling; \u2022Door controls and systems and exit devices: An extensive portfolio of life-safety products and solutions generally installed on fire doors and facility entrances and exits. Exit devices, also known as panic hardware, provide rapid egress to allow building occupants to exit safely in an emergency. Door controls and systems include mechanical door closers, automatic door operators, as well as high-performance interior and storefront door systems. In addition, with our recently acquired Access Technologies business, we now offer a full range of automatic entrance solutions, including sliding, swing, folding and ICU doors, as well as an array of sensors, controls and security options for commercial and institutional buildings; \u2022Doors, accessories and other: A portfolio of hollow metal, glass and specialty doors, as well as a variety of additional security products and components, including hinges, door pulls, door stops, bike lights, louvers, weather stripping, thresholds and other accessories, as well as certain bathroom fittings and accessibility aids; and \u2022Services and software: Our Access Technologies business offers extensive planned inspection, maintenance and repair services for its automatic entrance solutions throughout the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, we offer software as a service (\"SaaS\") offerings throughout the U.S. and internationally, including access control, IoT integration and workforce management solutions. We also offer ongoing aftermarket services, design and installation offerings and locksmith services in select locations. Customers We sell most of our products and solutions through distribution and retail channels, including specialty distribution, e-commerce and wholesalers. We have built a network of channel partners that help our customers choose the right solution to meet their security needs and help commercial and institutional end-users fulfill and install orders. We also sell through a variety of retail channels, including large do-it-yourself home improvement centers, multiple online and e-commerce platforms, as well as small, specialty showroom outlets. We work with our retail partners on developing marketing and merchandising strategies to maximize their sales per square foot of shelf space. Through a few of our businesses, most notably our Access Technologies business, Interflex and our Global Portable Security brands, we also provide products and services directly to end-users. Our 10 largest customers represented approximately 26% of our total Net revenues in 2022. No single customer represented 10% or more of our total Net revenues in 2022. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Sales and Marketing In markets where we sell through commercial and institutional distribution channels, we employ sales professionals around the world who work with a combination of end-users, security professionals, architects, contractors, engineers and distribution partners to develop specific, custom-configured solutions for our end-users\u2019 needs. Our field sales professionals are assisted by specification writers who work with architects, engineers and consultants to help design door openings and security systems to meet end-users\u2019 functional, aesthetic and regulatory requirements. Both groups are supported by dedicated customer care and technical sales-support specialists worldwide. We also support our sales efforts with a variety of marketing efforts, including trade-specific advertising, cooperative distributor merchandising, digital marketing and marketing at a variety of industry trade shows. In markets in which we sell through retail and home-builder distribution channels, we have teams of sales, merchandising and marketing professionals who help drive brand and product awareness through our channel partners and to consumers. We utilize a variety of advertising and marketing strategies, including traditional consumer media, retail merchandising, digital marketing, retail promotions and builder and consumer trade shows, to support these teams.  We also work actively with several industry bodies around the world to help promote effective and consistent safety and security standards. For example, we are members of the American Association of Automatic Door Manufacturers (AAADM), Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA), Connectivity Standards Alliance, Construction Specification Institute, Door and Hardware Institute (DHI), FiRa Consortium, National Association of State Fire Marshals (NASFM), Partner Alliance for Safer Schools (PASS), Physical Security Interoperability Alliance (PSIA), Security Industry Association, Security Technology Alliance, Z-Wave Alliance, The European Federation of Associations of Locks and Builders Hardware Manufacturers (ARGE), ASSOFERMA (Italy), BHE (Germany) and UNIQ (France). Production and Distribution We manufacture products in several geographic markets around the world. We operate 29 principal production and assembly facilities \u2013 16 in our Allegion Americas segment and 13 in our Allegion International segment. We own 16 of these facilities and lease the others. Our strategy is to produce in the region of use, wherever appropriate, to allow us to be closer to the end-user and increase efficiency and timely product delivery. Much of our U.S. based residential portfolio is manufactured in the Baja region of Mexico under the Maquiladora, Manufacturing and Export Services Industry (\"IMMEX\") program. In managing our network of production and assembly facilities, we focus on continuous improvement in customer experience, employee health and safety, productivity, resource utilization and operational excellence. We distribute our products through a broad network of channel partners. In addition, third-party manufacturing and logistics providers perform certain manufacturing, storage and distribution services for us to support certain parts of our manufacturing and distribution network. Raw Materials We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners for much of our supply base. Our global and regional commodity teams work with production leadership, product management and materials management teams to procure materials for production. Where appropriate, we may enter into fixed-cost contracts to lower overall costs. We purchase a wide range of raw materials, including steel, zinc, brass and other non-ferrous metals, as well as other parts and components, such as electronic components, to support our production facilities. Through much of 2022, we continued to experience supply chain disruptions and delays, including logistical challenges; shortages in parts and materials (particularly shortages of electronic components); and increased material and other inflation. While these trends have negatively impacted our results of operations, we have taken multiple actions to address these challenges, including product redesigns, carrying increased levels of safety stock and working with our supplier base, including establishing new and diverse supplier relationships, to increase part and component availability and our overall supply chain agility. As a result of these actions, we have seen many of these supply chain related challenges improve over the second half of 2022, although shortages of electronic parts and components persist. See \"Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for a more detailed discussion of these trends and challenges. Intellectual Property Intellectual property, inclusive of certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, is important to our business.\u00a0We create, protect and enforce our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to try to ensure the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights. We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe such distinctive marks are an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us and in distinguishing our products from others. We consider our CISA, Interflex, LCN, Schlage, SimonsVoss, Von Duprin and other associated trademarks to be among our most valuable assets, and we have registered these trademarks in a number of countries. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Facilities We operate through a broad network of sales offices, engineering centers, 29 principal production and assembly facilities and several distribution centers throughout the world. Our active properties represent approximately 6.7 million square feet, of which approximately 41% is leased.

In addition, we invest in initiatives that continuously drive improvements in product cost, quality, safety and sustainability. Our research and development team is managed as a global, collaborative group to identify and develop new technologies and worldwide product platforms. Our regionally located resources leverage expertise in local standards and configurations and apply those to adapt products for the benefit of our customers. Further, we operate a global technology center in Bengaluru, India, which augments and supports our regional engineering and technology teams. Seasonality Our business experiences seasonality that varies by product and service line. For instance, as more construction and do-it-yourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters in the Northern Hemisphere, our security product sales related to those projects are typically higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. However, certain other businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth quarter due to demand for services and project timing.  Human Capital Our human capital strategy is based on our values and is foundational to achieving our business strategy. To ensure we attract and retain top talent, we strive for a diverse and inclusive culture that rewards performance, provides growth and development opportunities and supports employees through competitive compensation, benefits and numerous volunteer and charitable giving opportunities. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 12,300 employees worldwide, with approximately 46% employed within the U.S. and approximately 54% based outside the U.S. Among our U.S. based employees, approximately 15% were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. Outside the U.S., we have employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a works council. The vast majority of our employees work on a full-time basis. Our employee base is supplemented by contingent labor where business demand fluctuates or we experience short-term needs for specialized skills. We believe our relations with our workforce in both unionized and non-unionized settings are generally positive. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefit programs are tailored to be competitive in the geographies where we work, including a total rewards package (which varies by country/region) that includes hourly and salaried compensation, performance-based incentive and long-term equity incentive plans, retirement, insurance and government social welfare programs, disability and family leave,  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents health and wellness programs, education benefits to pursue degrees and certifications and additional offerings to support financial stability and personal planning. The Allegion Leadership Behaviors \u2013 break boundaries, innovate, be courageous, engage and develop, champion change and be inclusive \u2013 work in concert with our performance management system to reinforce our values and code of conduct in assessing how people lead and deliver top performance. Talent Attraction  Our employer brand strength creates a differentiated employee experience that attracts and retains the right talent for Allegion. Our talent attraction efforts are focused on and highlight a culture that reflects our core values, Allegion Leadership Behaviors and business objectives. These efforts begin well before people work for us. Around the world, our sites partner with schools and support teachers, providing mentoring, grants, scholarships, internships, co-op programs, classroom technology and on-site activities and full-time rotational programs after graduation. Our sites sponsor science, technology, engineering and math (\"STEM\") programs and competitions to spur interest in fields like robotics, IT and engineering. In the U.S., we also host annual Manufacturing Day events virtually and at several of our production and assembly facilities. These programs expose students to careers in manufacturing and technology and provide educators with programming to encourage academic excellence and social development while building a pipeline of talent for us.  We want to attract talent with core capabilities relevant to our long-term corporate business strategy: customer focus, innovation, partnering, pace and agility and collaboration. We use a variety of recruitment tactics to ensure a strong base of labor for manufacturing operations and to build the base of talent with these capabilities. Throughout the recruitment cycle, we provide a technology-enabled seamless experience for internal and external candidates and hiring managers. Talent Development and Succession Planning Talent development and succession planning are key components of the Allegion Operating System, our system of annual operation that supports governance, reporting processes and management of the business. Our performance management system includes annual performance reviews for all permanent salaried employees, where, in alignment with our values, an open feedback culture is encouraged, regardless of level or hierarchy. Inclusive talent development and succession planning takes place at all levels of the organization and is supported through the Allegion Leadership Behaviors, individual career mapping, assessment of performance and talent pipeline planning up to and including the executive leadership team (\"ELT\"). As part of their quarterly business review, the ELT reviews talent development, focusing on developing a diverse succession pipeline. These cross-functional reviews highlight individuals who are ready for new opportunities, individuals who are on a special assignment or project and individuals early in their career that demonstrate emerging leadership skills. Learning and Development  Opportunities for on-going learning and development are delivered to employees through structured coursework, on-site and expert-led training and experiential, applied development. The Allegion Academy is offered globally, supporting multiple languages and providing more than 20,000 self-guided online courses, as well as learning community channels on targeted skills and topics like inclusion and diversity. We offer programs to provide successive levels of development, including reskilling and upskilling existing employees, as well as strengths-based leadership curriculum and global programs for employee mentoring and coaching. Enterprise excellence initiatives and sprint teams expand skills in lean manufacturing and quality principles and lead to redesigning workflow to boost productivity and reduce waste. Engagement and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (\"DEI\")  Engagement and DEI are also parts of the Allegion Operating System. Engagement surveys provide a mechanism to gather direct employee feedback, give team leaders insights on potential areas of focus and allow leaders to prioritize and take action on their teams\u2019 foundational, inclusion, growth and development needs. Strengths-based leadership is an element of our commitment to inclusion: the more employees understand their own strengths, the better equipped they are to add value and appreciate the contributions of diverse members of their teams. Engagement and DEI are topics for learning communities, employee roundtables and ongoing, regular analysis and dialogue among people leaders, executive leadership and Board of Directors. We believe in fundamental standards that support our employees, including a commitment to building and maintaining diverse and inclusive workplaces, safe and healthy practices and competitive wages and benefits. We embrace all differences and similarities among colleagues and within the relationships we foster with customers, suppliers and the communities where we live and work. Employee led resource and affinity groups provide enrichment opportunities for women's leadership, early career professionals, allies and members of the LBGTQIA+, veteran and Hispanic communities, working parents, innovation, health and fitness, site-specific engagement and community volunteering and philanthropy. Whatever background, experience, race, color, national origin, religion, age, gender, gender identity, disability status, sexual orientation, protected veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law, we make sure that potential and current employees have every opportunity for application and the opportunity to give their best at work. The efforts of Allegion\u2019s DEI Steering Committee, our ELT and the employee-led Inclusion Council, are driving expectations and accountability while creating role models and change champions. Our DEI strategy has three core pillars: 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Learn & listen deeply: Learn to recognize biases and mitigate them. Seek to first understand an individual's perspective rather than respond or act; \u2022Unite widely: Create a workplace where all employees feel welcomed, respected and valued, enabling customers to more easily connect with our brands through our people; and  \u2022Take action: Identify the unique things that impact our organization, our communities and our industry.  During 2022, we updated our strategic action priorities, which center on: 1) Building and sustaining equitable policies and practices; 2) Creating an inclusive culture; and 3) Elevating the approach to DEI in our industry and having a positive impact on our communities. We are dedicated to fulfilling equal opportunity commitments in all decisions regarding all employment actions and at all levels of employment. In partnership with our Human Resources organization, our Equal Employment Opportunity Officer ensures that the applicable policy and procedures are appropriately established, implemented and disseminated, including those prohibiting discrimination, harassment, bullying and/or retaliation. Civic Involvement  Civic involvement is part of the value proposition we offer employees and supports DEI, growth and development. We provide multi-faceted support for our communities, guided by three philanthropic pillars: safety and security; wellness; and addressing the unique needs of the communities where we live, learn, work and visit. Corporate sponsorships and voluntary employee payroll deductions support a wide range of non-profits, including those that address housing and school security and safety; children and youth programs; education and scholarships for people of color and those who are economically disadvantaged and support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities; community safety nets for basic needs (e.g., food, shelter, transportation) for underserved people and to break the cycle of poverty; wellness, mental health, health research, emergency relief and blood supply initiatives; and programs to advance equality, justice and address systemic bias. In addition to corporate sponsorships, site leaders and employees are encouraged to organize local volunteer and fundraising activities, provide grants to local organizations and serve on boards and committees.  Respect for Human Rights Our respect for human rights is expressed in standards for our employees, our business partners, our customers and our communities. We uphold our Global Human Rights Policy, with standards that align with basic working conditions and human rights concepts advanced by international organizations such as the International Labor Organization and the United Nations. This policy also represents our own minimum standards for working conditions and human rights in our business and supply chains. In addition, we conduct risk assessments and continue to have conversations with the suppliers and companies we work with about the importance of human rights. Employee Health and Safety  Employee health and safety are top priorities, and we consistently rank as the safest among leading competitors on core measures such as the total recordable incident rate. \u2018Be safe, be healthy\u2019 is a core organizational value in our proactive safety culture and has guided our response throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to adapt to changing health conditions at a local level and support a wide range of health and safety measures, including encouraging preventative measures such as COVID-19 and influenza vaccines and booster shots. The ELT, with oversight from our Board of Directors, is responsible for risk management, employee accountability, safety hazard recognition and executing safety initiatives. We monitor leading and lagging indicators related to health and safety as part of our ongoing management of the Allegion Operating System and regularly update the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors on key developments and employee health and safety topics. In recognition of our efforts to integrate sound environmental, health and safety (\"EHS\") management with our business operations, in 2021, we received the renowned Robert W. Campbell Award from the National Safety Council.  Regulatory Matters We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., relating to EHS matters. We are committed to conducting our business in a safe, environmentally responsible and sustainable manner, in compliance with all applicable EHS laws and regulations, and in a manner that helps promote and protect the health and safety of our environment, associates, customers, contractors and members of our local communities worldwide. We operate with principles that support our proactive commitments, including: \u2022Integrating sound EHS and sustainability strategies in all elements of our business functions, including objectives and measurements; \u2022Conducting periodic, formal evaluation of our compliance status and annual review of objectives and targets; \u2022Creating a workplace culture where all employees are responsible for safety; \u2022Making continuous improvements in EHS and sustainability management systems and performance, including the reduction in the usage of natural resources, waste minimization, prevention of pollution and prevention of workplace accidents, injuries and risks; 13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Designing, operating and maintaining our facilities in a manner that minimizes negative EHS and sustainability impacts; \u2022Using materials responsibly, including the recycling and reuse of materials, where feasible; and \u2022Acting in a way that shows sensitivity to community concerns about EHS and sustainability issues. We recognize that these principles are critical to our future success. We have a dedicated environmental program designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate any identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities. We also regularly evaluate our remediation methods that are in addition to, or in replacement of, those we currently utilize based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes. We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have, from time to time, received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and similar state authorities. We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, our involvement is minimal. In estimating our liability, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties\u2019 financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future. For a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities, see Notes 2 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") factors important to our business are embedded into our values and our leadership's commitment to create a workplace culture committed to doing the right thing in the right way. Our Board of Directors oversees the Company's ESG strategies, goals and performance, and both our leadership and employees all have a responsibility to uphold excellence, as we believe our commitment to ESG matters helps advance engagement and business vitality. In 2022, Allegion was among the notable companies honored with a SEAL Business Sustainability Award, in recognition of our proactive water reduction project implemented across two of our production facilities in the Baja region of Mexico.
