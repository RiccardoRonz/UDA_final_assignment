{"cik": 319201, "item_1A": "ITEM  1.BUSINESS Specific industry and technical terms used in this section are defined in the subsection entitled \u201cGlossary,\u201d found at the end of this Item\u00a01. The Company KLA Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (\u201cKLA\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d and also referred to as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or similar references) is a supplier of industry-leading equipment and services that enables innovation throughout the electronics industry. We provide advanced process control and process-enabling solutions for manufacturing wafers, reticles/masks, chemicals/materials, integrated circuits (\u201cIC\u201d or \u201cchip\u201d), packaged ICs, printed circuit boards (\u201cPCB\u201d) and flat panel displays (\u201cFPD\u201d), as well as comprehensive support and services across our installed base. Our suite of advanced products, coupled with our unique yield management software and services, allow us to deliver the solutions our customers need to achieve their productivity goals by significantly improving yields, reducing waste, reducing risks and reducing costs. This improves their overall profitability and return on investment. KLA was formed as KLA-Tencor Corporation in April 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments Corporation and Tencor Instruments, two long-time leaders in the semiconductor capital equipment industry that began operations in 1975 and 1976, respectively. We are organized into three reportable segments: Semiconductor Process Control; Specialty Semiconductor Process; and PCB, Display and Component Inspection. Prior to July 1, 2022, we had a fourth segment, Other, but core assets from that segment were sold, making it non-operational and the segment was eliminated.  Within the Semiconductor Process Control segment, our comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and software products, as well as related services, help IC, wafer, reticle/mask and chemical/materials manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the entire fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production. These products and services are designed to provide comprehensive solutions to help customers accelerate development and production ramp cycles, achieve higher and more stable product yields and improve their overall profitability. Within the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, we develop and sell advanced vacuum deposition and etch process tools, which are used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers, including manufacturers of microelectromechanical systems (\u201cMEMS\u201d), radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) communication semiconductors, and power semiconductors for automotive and industrial applications. Within the PCB, Display and Component Inspection segment, we sell products and services that enable electronic device manufacturers to inspect, test and measure PCBs, IC substrates, FPDs and packaged ICs to verify their quality, pattern the desired electronic circuitry on the relevant substrate and perform three-dimensional shaping of metalized circuits on multiple surfaces.

The investor relations website is used to communicate with the public about us and our products, services and other matters.  Industry Our core focus is enabling technological advances and improving manufacturing yields in the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer - a round disk typically 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter, about as thick as a credit card and gray in color. The process of manufacturing wafers is highly sophisticated and involves the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon. The ingots are then sliced into wafers. Prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish. Other, more specialized wafers, such as epitaxial silicon (\u201cepi\u201d), silicon on insulator (\u201cSOI\u201d), gallium nitride (\u201cGaN\u201d) and silicon carbide (\u201cSiC\u201d) are also used in the semiconductor industry. 1 1 1 Table of Contents Table of Contents The manufacturing cycle of an IC is grouped into three phases: design, fabrication and testing. IC design involves the architectural layout of the circuit, as well as design verification and reticle generation. The fabrication of a semiconductor chip (or \u201csemiconductor\u201d) is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors, semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers. The deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns, remove portions of the film layers, and perform other functions such as heat treatment, measurement and inspection. Most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps, many performed multiple times. Most chips consist of two main structures: the lower structure, typically consisting of transistors or capacitors, which performs the \u201csmart\u201d functions; and the upper \u201cinterconnect\u201d structure, typically consisting of circuitry, which connects the components in the lower structure. When the layers on the wafer have been fabricated, each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality. The wafer is then cut into individual chips, and the chips that pass functional testing are packaged. Final testing is performed on all packaged chips. Packaged chips are then mounted onto PCBs for connection to the rest of the electronic system. Additionally, FPDs are manufactured using processes similar to ICs (e.g., film deposition, photolithography, etching) except using glass as the starting substrate. Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers. This is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ICs, products utilizing ICs and other electronic components. We do not consider our business to be seasonal. Still, our business has historically been cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers, and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets. Downturns in the semiconductor or other industries in which we operate, or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as customer consolidation, could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.  Companies anticipating future market demands by developing and advancing new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market. Accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of high-performance devices are critical goals of modern semiconductor and related electronics manufacturing. Ramping to high-volume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase IC manufacturers\u2019 revenue and profit for a given product. Leading semiconductor manufacturers invest in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies, some requiring new substrate and film materials, new geometries, new transistor architectures, new power distribution schemes, advanced multi-patterning optical and extreme ultraviolet (\u201cEUV\u201d) lithography, and advanced packaging techniques. As design rules decrease, yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects. Device performance characteristics (namely speed, capacity or power management) also become more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation. New process materials require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process. Moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face. The continuing evolution of semiconductors to smaller geometries and more complex multi-level circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices. Construction of an advanced IC fabrication facility today can cost well above $10 billion, substantially more than previous-generation facilities. In addition, chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment. The semiconductor capital equipment industry has been experiencing multiple growth drivers bolstered by demand for semiconductors from leading-edge foundry and logic manufacturers to support computational power and connectivity for markets such as artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) and 5G wireless technology and increasing investment by our customers in legacy nodes. The growth of virtual engagement and the pace of digitization has been driven by COVID-19 related travel restrictions and quarantines, work from home requirements, and advances in healthcare and industrial applications. These factors, together with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and intelligence in automobiles, are powering leading-edge design node technology investments and capacity expansions. Intertwined in these areas, spurred by the requirements of big data, is the growth in demand for memory chips. Regionalization of semiconductors has become a trend as access to semiconductors is viewed from the lens of national security. The People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d) continues to emerge as a major region for the manufacturing of logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world\u2019s largest consumer of ICs. The Chinese government initiatives are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity. Although China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector, Commerce has added certain China-based entities to the U.S. Entity List (a list of parties that are generally ineligible to receive U.S. regulated items without prior licensing from BIS, restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without a license. In addition, Commerce has imposed export licensing requirements on China-based customers that are military end users or engaged in military end uses. It also requires our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to certain entities on the U.S. Entity List. 2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents Research and Development The market for semiconductor and electronics industries is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation. These technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. We make significant investments in product R&D for the timely development of new products and enhancements necessary to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to R&D programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs. Our key R&D activities during the fiscal year ended June\u00a030, 2023 involved the development of process control and process-enabling solutions for a broad range of industries including semiconductors, PCBs and displays. For information regarding our R&D expenses during the last three fiscal years, see Item\u00a07 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is primarily due to our leading technology, which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product R&D. Even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry, we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development to enhance our competitive position. Customers We count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to compete successfully in Asia, one of the largest markets for our equipment. Our ability to compete in this area depends upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the U.S., and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region. For the fiscal years ended June\u00a030, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, primarily in the Semiconductor Process Control segment:Fiscal Year Ended June 30,202320222021Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

We have direct sales forces in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. We maintain an export compliance program designed to meet the requirements of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State and the trade regulations of the international jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition to sales and service offices in the U.S., we conduct sales, marketing and services out of subsidiaries or branches in many regions; some of the largest include China, Germany, Israel, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. We believe sales outside the U.S. will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues. International revenues accounted for approximately 88%, 90% and 89% of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended June\u00a030, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in Note 19 \u201cSegment Reporting and Geographic Information\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, restrictions on export technology, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations. In addition, international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business. Although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in non-U.S. dollar product sales through hedging activities, there can be no assurance that  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents such efforts will be adequate. These factors, as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in Item\u00a01A \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.

Services Our service programs enable our customers in all business sectors to maintain the high performance and productivity of our products through a flexible array of service options. Whether a manufacturing site is producing wafers, reticles, ICs, display or PCB products, our highly trained service teams collaborate with customers to determine the best products and services to meet technology and business requirements. Backlog Our backlog, which represents our remaining performance obligation (\u201cRPO\u201d) to deliver products and services, totaled $11.40 billion and $13.11 billion as of June\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received. We expect to recognize approximately 40% to 50% of these performance obligations as revenue beyond the next 12 months, but this estimate is subject to constant change depending on the following: Macro-economic factors and the effect on customer behavior: The supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic as well as elevated demand levels in recent years have led to customers agreeing to purchase equipment from us with lead times that are longer than our historical experience. However, more recently, we have seen the macro-driven slowdown have an impact on consumers\u2019 semiconductor device demand, causing the semiconductor industry to rebalance its supply chain and inventory levels. As a result, some of our customers began adjusting their capacity expansion-focused capital expenditure plans for calendar year 2023. As customers try to balance the evolution of their technological, production or market needs with the timing and content of orders placed with us, there is increased risk of order modifications, pushouts, or cancellations. This, in turn, makes it more difficult for us to navigate potential timing disparities between, on the one hand, our ability to manufacture, deliver and install products and, on the other hand, the requirements of our customers. It also has the potential to cause earnings volatility for us as it can affect our revenue recognition and increase the likelihood of inventory-related charges. In addition, because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders, our shipment backlog at any date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods. Export restrictions: Commerce and BIS have mandated the following (the \u201cBIS Rules\u201d): \u2022Requiring an export license from BIS for sale of anything to an entity on the U.S. Entity List of China-based entities, which is a list of parties that are generally ineligible to receive U.S.-regulated products and services without prior licensing, as well as for the use of certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to certain entities on the U.S. Entity List. \u2022Requiring an export license for sales to China-based customers that are military end users or engaged in military end uses, and for certain U.S. semiconductor and high-performance computing technology (including wafer fab  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents equipment), for the use of such technology for certain end uses in China, and for the provision of support by U.S. persons to certain advanced IC fabs located in China. We are taking appropriate measures to comply with these regulations and are applying for export licenses, when required, although there can be no assurance that export licenses will be granted. The possible negative effects on our future business of export licenses not being granted could be material and could result in a substantial reduction to our RPO or require us to return substantial deposits received from customers in China for purchase orders. Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies We perform system design, assembly and testing in-house and utilize an outsourcing strategy to manufacture components and major subassemblies. Our in-house manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies acquired through third-party vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products. Our principal manufacturing activities occur in the U.S., Singapore, Israel, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and China. Our supply chain strategy incorporates considerations for ethical labor practices, responsible minerals sourcing, and Responsible Business Alliance and SEMI guidelines. Some critical parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, \u201cparts\u201d) that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications, while other parts are standard commercial products. We use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials to manufacture and support our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, this is not always possible. Certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Through our business interruption planning, we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by, among other things, monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials, providing financial support and incentives to encourage vendors to increase capacity when required, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials, and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules. Although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources, or disruptions within our suppliers\u2019 often complex supply chains, could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers, damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Competition The worldwide market for technologically advanced process control, process-enabling and yield management solutions used by semiconductor and electronics manufacturers is highly competitive, with important competitive factors including system performance, ease of use, reliability, technical service and support, and overall cost of ownership. However, we believe that, while the competitive factors listed are important, the customers\u2019 overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated capabilities into their existing development and manufacturing processes to enhance productivity, improve yields and reduce waste. To remain competitive, we use significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product R&D. In each of our product markets, we have many competitors, including companies such as Applied Materials, Inc., ASML Holding N.V., Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Onto Innovation, Inc. and Lasertec, Inc., some of which may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics. We may also face future competition from new market entrants overseas or domestically. We maintain our market position by building long-term relationships with our customers to meet their dynamic needs, as well as anticipating future market demands and enabling our customers to accelerate adoption and production of new technologies, as discussed further in the \u201cIndustry\u201d section of this Item 1. Management believes that we are well positioned in the market with our industry-leading portfolio of products and services. However, any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share. Should this occur, it could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Acquisitions We continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. The inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Patents and Other Proprietary Rights 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents We protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of IP laws, including patent, copyright and trade secret. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through IP laws. In addition, from time to time we acquire license rights under U.S. and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties, and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other security measures. Although we consider patents and other IP significant to our business, no single patent, copyright or trade secret is essential to us as a whole or to any of our business segments.  No assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications, that license assignments will be made as anticipated, or that our patents, licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. No assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology. Government Regulations\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including, but not limited to, laws, rules and regulations related to anti-corruption, antitrust, data privacy requirements, employment, environmental, foreign exchange controls, health and safety requirements, immigration, import/export requirements, IP and tax. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate in the case of environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment, alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials. Our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations could subject us to future liabilities. For information about risks related to government regulations, see \u201cBacklog - Export restrictions\u201d above and Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Environmental, Social and Governance Initiatives KLA strives to proactively manage and address the ESG topics most important to our stakeholders. Guided by our values, we have integrated ESG considerations into many of our business practices and policies, and work together with our customers, peers, partners and suppliers to promote improvement in human rights, labor, environment, health and safety, anti-corruption, ethics and management system standards within our operations and our supply chain. Our ESG initiatives are another way KLA seeks to deliver long-term value for our stockholders and exemplify our core values.

We include details in our Global Impact Report that are not included in this Form 10-K because we seek to be responsive to various areas of interest of our stakeholders; however, such information generally does not, and is not expected to, have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position. In addition, no assurance can be given that our ESG initiatives will have the intended results or be able to be completed as currently envisioned, whether due to cost, feasibility or other constraints. Human Capital Management  At KLA, our people drive our success, and we celebrate the diversity of backgrounds and experiences that all employees bring to the table. We recognize that our competitive advantage is our people and the technology they develop. We believe it is critical to attract, motivate and retain a dedicated, talented, and innovative team of employees who exhibit our core values. As talent and retention continue to be a challenging issue for many companies, we strive to work proactively to address these concerns. We also aim to support employees\u2019 personal and professional growth. Our talent development programs focus on developing the whole person through comprehensive training offerings, employee engagement programs and health and wellness activities. We embrace our responsibility to lead through exceptional training programs and professional development and through enabling our employees to be safe, secure, healthy and feel included and empowered to bring their whole self to work.  Our Core Values At KLA, our core values \u2013 demonstrating perseverance; striving to be better; being honest, forthright, and consistent; building high-performing teams; and being indispensable to our customers \u2013 serve as a foundation for our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders and reflect a commitment to ethical business practices and corporate citizenship in the places where we do business. Our Workforce As of June\u00a030, 2023, we had approximately 15,000 regular full-time employees and approximately 210 part-time and temporary employees in facilities located in 18 regions. Approximately 30% of our regular full-time employees are located in the U.S., 22% in Europe and Middle Eastern countries and 48% in Asia Pacific and Japan, with approximately 21% engaged in manufacturing, 25% in R&D, 28% in customer service, 5% in sales and marketing and 19% in other roles. Except for our employees in Belgium (where a trade union delegation has been recognized) and our employees in the German operations of our MIE and Laser Imaging Systems business units (who are represented by employee works councils), none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.  In fiscal year 2023, our overall employee voluntary turnover rate was 5.1%. Compensation and Benefits At KLA, our talent is the heartbeat of our organization. We value our employees as individuals and aim to recognize and support their needs so they can bring their best selves to work every day. We engage with our employees about what they need to be successful in and out of the workplace. We seek to achieve our objective of attracting, retaining, and motivating our workforce by linking a significant portion of compensation to Company and business unit performance. We seek competitiveness and fairness in total compensation relative to peer comparisons and internal equity. We provide long-term incentives to a broad base of employees to share in our success through restricted stock units (\u201cRSU\u201d) and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d). We also provide bonus plans and profit sharing to employees who do not receive RSUs. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents In addition to providing our employees with competitive compensation packages, we have built out a robust suite of benefits to help foster the well-being of all employees. Our benefits are designed to meet the needs of employees and their families, including paid time off, parental leave, bereavement leave, health insurance coverage, flexible work arrangements, contributions to retirement savings and access to employee assistance and work-life programs. We also offer programs to employees to help improve their health and wellness habits. KLA\u2019s virtual and in-person wellness course offerings span both physical and mental health. We offer in-person and virtual workout classes as well as seminars on mindfulness, meditation and other wellness topics. We hold online fitness and well-being classes that include body-tune-up, yoga and nutrition as well as the maintenance of life balance and the importance of sleep, hydration and relaxation. Throughout our sites, we host a series of events and challenges, both virtually and in person, to encourage our employees to stay active. Our wellness program helps employees manage and improve their physical and mental health and build healthy lifestyle habits in engaging ways. We expanded hybrid work options and telecommuting. We support working parents faced with challenges balancing working from home and caring for their families\u2019 needs. We also offer courses on financial literacy and planning to help our employees prepare for their financial futures. Inclusion and Diversity The journey to becoming a truly inclusive and diverse global organization takes time, and we are deeply committed to this path. At KLA, Inclusion & Diversity (\u201cI&D\u201d) is a shared aspiration, commitment and responsibility, as well as a direct expression of our core values. In our drive to be better, we seek to create a more diverse workforce year over year. We do this because KLA, like society, benefits when we work with diverse teams to harness varying perspectives and talents in the furtherance of humanity. KLA is an equal opportunity employer and we are in compliance with affirmative action requirements applicable to federal contractors. We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field. Over the last fiscal year, we increased our I&D efforts in several ways. We continue to provide training with a focus on I&D. Managers and employees can hone their skills on mitigating unconscious bias, non-discrimination, anti-harassment and are introduced to models of intentional inclusion that emphasize key leadership qualities. In fiscal year 2022, we introduced a new campaign called Inclusion For All. This campaign engages all employees in KLA\u2019s inclusion and diversity efforts by providing tips and everyday actions that can have large impacts. This campaign supplements the formal training we offer around I&D, and the work of our Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERG\u201d). KLA currently has four ERGs with chapters all around the world to engage employees in service of our I&D and business goals, fostering an inclusive environment. WISE (Women in STEM, Empowered), is an employee-led group that includes people of all genders, who have joined to support the professional growth of women at KLA. WISE has chapters in the U.S., Israel, Europe and India with more chapters forming in other regions. Konexi\u00f3n, is our Hispanic/Latinx ERG where employees can interact and innovate through cultural sharing and understanding of the Hispanic/Latinx community. BELIEVE (Black Employees Leading in Inclusion, Excellence, Values and Education) supports the recruitment and advancement of Black talent while also promoting cultural awareness, understanding and allyship of the Black community. Both Konexi\u00f3n and BELIEVE have chapters throughout the U.S. Our newest ERG is PRISM (where Pride, Respect, Inclusion, and Solidarity Meet), and was started as a global ERG. PRISM\u2019s mission is to amplify KLA\u2019s commitment to equality and inclusion by encouraging a safe and open working environment for LGBTQ+ employees and allies. Celebrating our diversity through formal observations of cultural holidays is another way we advance inclusion at KLA. These celebrations are an important way for KLA employees to learn about different traditions, cultural norms and our own employees\u2019 experiences with different cultures. As of June\u00a030, 2023, our global workforce was 81% male and 19% female, and 8% of our workforce in the U.S. was composed of Black or African American, and/or Hispanic/Latinx employees. At the end of fiscal 2023, 30% of our Board of Directors were female and 30% of our Board of Directors were underrepresented minorities under the listing rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Learning and Development We offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at KLA. We emphasize stretch assignments, on-the-job development, as well as classroom and online training. Our employees have access to a wide range of programs, workshops, classes and resources to help them excel in their careers and share what they know with others. Our performance management process includes performance feedback against goals, a review of key competencies that are needed to be successful at KLA and career development discussions. 10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents We emphasize frequent 1-on-1 meetings between managers and employees and regular coaching and feedback sessions. Through coaching and mentorship programs, our employees are inspired to push the boundaries of their comfort zones and seek creative solutions. If our employees pursue external learning opportunities and education, we support that too, through tuition reimbursement. Through our partnerships with Stanford University and the University of Michigan, employees can pursue advanced degrees in engineering that are customized for KLA, and the skills and competencies required to support our customers. We also offer a competitive student loan reimbursement program in the U.S. We have a robust succession planning process especially targeted at director level positions and above. Our Enterprise Leadership Program, a comprehensive, two-year management training program that we offer, helps to prepare KLA employees to fill future leadership roles. In fiscal year 2023, several of our managers and leaders went through the program. Additionally, our Values in Action training which was also targeted at the director level and above provided further guidance on our values, business ethics and inclusion and diversity. Most of our employees are also required to take annual training courses and regular certifications related to their work, including those pertaining to the environment, data privacy and workplace health and safety. Employee Engagement We conduct regular employee surveys to check in with our global workforce and obtain input on several topics. The feedback we receive from these surveys helps us assess employee sentiment, identify areas of improvement and guides our decision-making as it relates to people management. In addition, our executives conduct regular quarterly webcasts that enable all employees to engage with senior leaders and ask questions in an open Q&A session.  As we began to emerge from the global pandemic in 2022, many employees sought connection as never before. Through our Employee Engagement Pulse Surveys, which had an 83% response rate in fiscal year 2023, we identified the top priorities in a post-pandemic world. We created action plans to act on these priorities and engaged our workforce in identifying potential solutions to address these top concerns. Even though our survey rated our level of engagement as being \u201cGood,\u201d we realize that we have opportunities for improvement, and we created new initiatives which consisted of global manager communications, individual and team coaching and a training titled \u201cEngaging with Engagement.\u201d Employee Health and Safety and Pandemic Response The health and safety of our employees is paramount to our success. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. We accomplish this through strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety, including recognition and control of workplace hazards, tracking injury and illness rates, utilizing a global travel health program and maintaining detailed emergency and disaster recovery plans. KLA\u2019s top priority during the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families, our customers and our community. The continuing demands of COVID-19 required us to build upon our global approach to Employee Health and Safety (\u201cEHS\u201d) with strong collaboration across the regions. This has resulted in the adoption of best practices for each of our sites, improving business resiliency and the health and safety of our employees worldwide. As COVID-19 restrictions alleviate, KLA has adjusted work practices and controls to promote employee safety as they return to the office and in conformance with the local regulations. KLA continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation in our communities in the event controls need to be reestablished to protect our employees and our business commitments. Our goal is always zero accidents across our facilities, and to achieve that, we conduct proactive risk assessments and audits to constantly improve our efforts. We implemented a global standard for our incidents to ensure consistency across our regions, and continually outperform industry averages for injury rates.  We made a commitment to globalize our ISO 45001 (Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems) certification and expand our ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems) certification beyond our larger sites. The goal is to execute these plans over the course of 2023-2024. In calendar 2022, we built the foundations for these systems as we move to integrate our EHS management systems globally. In the remainder of calendar 2023, that work continues as we are deploying the system elements across our key manufacturing locations.  We are committed to reducing safety risks across business units and at corporate sites worldwide. We revised our approach to risk assessments to \u201crisk rank\u201d our own operations. We are utilizing this system not only to measure our own performance, but also to help improve the performance of our supply chain and customers.\u202fAll new hires are required to complete a health and safety training program. In addition, our service technicians are required to achieve and maintain role- 11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents specific safety training certifications. Our excellent safety record, which is less than half of the semiconductor industry average, is a tribute to our employees\u2019 efforts, the breadth and depth of our training programs and our dedication to safety policy management.
