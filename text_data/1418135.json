In addition to our major brands above, we also own regional and smaller niche brands, such as Big Red, Sun Drop and Vernors. In the CSD market, we distribute finished beverages and manufacture beverage concentrates and fountain syrups. Our beverage concentrates, which are highly concentrated proprietary flavors used to make syrup or finished beverages, are used by our own Packaged Beverages segment, as well as sold to third party bottling companies through our Beverage Concentrates segment. According to IRi, we had a\u00a024.2%\u00a0share of the U.S. CSD market in\u00a02022\u00a0(measured by retail sales). We also manufacture fountain syrup that we sell to the foodservice industry directly and indirectly through bottlers or through other third parties. In the NCB market segment in the U.S., we participate primarily in the premium water category, including enhanced and flavored water, RTD tea, juice, juice drinks, and mixer categories. In addition to our major brands above, we also sell regional and smaller niche brands, such as Nantucket Nectars. We manufacture most of our NCBs as RTD beverages and distribute them through our own distribution network and through third parties or direct to our customers' warehouses. In addition to NCB beverages, we also manufacture Mott's apple sauce as a finished product. In Mexico and the Caribbean, we participate primarily in the carbonated mineral water, flavored CSDs, bottled water and vegetable juice categories. In Mexico, we manufacture and sell our brands through both our own manufacturing and distribution operations as well as third party bottlers. In the Caribbean, we distribute our products solely through third party distributors and bottlers. We also distribute certain products in other international jurisdictions through various third party bottlers and distributors. Our Keurig single serve brewers are aimed at changing the way consumers prepare and enjoy coffee and other beverages both at home and away from home in places such as offices, restaurants, cafeterias, convenience stores and hotels. We create value by developing and selling our Keurig single serve brewers and by expanding Keurig brewer household adoption, which grew to nearly 38 million U.S. households for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately 2\u00a0million U.S. households from the prior year, based on third party survey data and our own estimates. Expansion of Keurig system household adoption enables sales of specialty coffee and a variety of other specialty beverages in K-Cup pods (including hot and iced teas, hot cocoa and other beverages) for use with Keurig brewers. We also offer traditional whole bean and ground coffee in other package types, including bags, fractional packages and cans. We, together with our partners, are able to bring consumers high-quality coffee and other beverage experiences from the brands they love, all through the one-touch simplicity and convenience of Keurig brewers. We currently offer a portfolio of more than 125 owned, licensed, partner and private label brands, including the top ten best-selling coffee brands in the U.S. based on IRi. 2 2 2 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  PRODUCT AND PACKAGE INNOVATION We are focused on a robust innovation pipeline within our portfolio of products to build household penetration of our business. We regularly launch new brewers with new features and benefits, technological advances, sustainable attributes, and changes in aesthetics to provide a variety of options to suit individual consumer preferences. We also continuously innovate and renovate our portfolio of K-cup pods, CSDs and NCBs to provide an expansive array of flavors.  During 2022, we launched our K-Caf\u00e9 SMART single-serve coffee, latte and cappuccino maker, which combines our BrewID technology platform with a built-in milk frother to create a full range of hot, iced, and specialty coffee drinks. The K-Caf\u00e9 SMART also connects to our mobile app, which provides more than 80 easy-to-follow coffeehouse drink recipes. We also launched Keurig iQ, a proprietary database providing insights on K-Cup pod consumption and shopping behaviors that we believe will enhance our consumer experience. We additionally entered into new partnerships with BLK & Bold Specialty Beverages and Intelligensia Coffee to provide these premium brands in K-cup pod format. In our NCB portfolio, we launched Snapple Elements, a line of teas and juice drinks in three flavors: Rain (agave cactus juice drink), Fire (dragon fruit juice drink) and Air (prickly pear and peach white tea). We acquired the global rights to Atypique in 2022, which provides a range of RTD non-alcoholic cocktails, such as margaritas, gin & tonic and mojitos. We also invested in Nutrabolt, a global active health and wellness company with a portfolio of brands, including C4 Energy, a RTD performance energy drink; Tractor, which offers certified organic, non-GMO beverage solutions in the fountain foodservice business; and Athletic Brewing Company, a leading non-alcoholic craft beer maker. OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS As of December 31, 2022, our operating structure consists of four reportable segments: Coffee Systems, Packaged Beverages, Beverage Concentrates, and Latin America Beverages. Segment financial data, including financial information about foreign and domestic operations, is included in Note\u00a07 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Coffee Systems Our Coffee Systems segment is primarily a producer of innovative single serve brewers and specialty coffee in the U.S. and Canada.  Our Coffee Systems segment manufactures over 80% of the pods in the single-serve K-Cup pod format in the U.S., on a dollar share basis. We manufacture and sell 100% of the K-Cup pods of the following brands to retailers, away from home channel participants and end-use consumers: Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, The Original Donut Shop, McCaf\u00e9, Van Houtte, and REVV.  We manufacture and sell K-Cup pods for the following brands to our partners, who in turn sell them to retailers: Starbucks, Dunkin', Folgers, Tim Hortons, Peet's, Maxwell House, Eight O\u2019Clock, Newman\u2019s Own Organics, Caribou Coffee, Community Coffee, Intelligensia, and BLK & Bold, as well as private label arrangements. Generally, we are able to sell these brands to our away from home channel participants and end-use consumers. We also have agreements for manufacturing, distributing, and selling K-Cup pods for tea under brands such as Celestial Seasonings, Lipton and Tazo. We also produce and sell K-Cup pods for cocoa, including through a licensing agreement for the Swiss Miss brand, and hot apple cider, including under our own brand, Mott's. Our Coffee Systems segment manufactures its K-Cup pods in facilities in North America that include specialty designed proprietary high-speed packaging lines using freshly roasted and ground coffee as well as tea, cocoa and other products. We offer high-quality, responsibly sourced coffee, including certified single-origin, organic, flavored, limited edition and proprietary blends. We carefully select our coffee beans and appropriately roast the coffees to optimize their taste and flavor differences. We engineer and design most of our single serve brewers and utilize third-party contract manufacturers located in various countries in Asia for brewer appliance manufacturing. We distribute our brewers using third-party distributors, retail partners and through our website at www.keurig.com. In 2022, Walmart and Costco were the Coffee Systems segment's largest customers. The loss of one of those customers could have a material adverse effect on the Coffee Systems segment. Beverage Concentrates Our Beverage Concentrates segment is principally a brand ownership business where we manufacture beverage concentrates and syrups in our manufacturing facilities in St. Louis, Missouri, and Newbridge, Ireland, and sell them throughout the U.S. and Canada. Most of the brands in this segment are CSD brands. Key brands include Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Schweppes, Crush, A&W, Sunkist, 7UP, SunDrop, Squirt, Big Red, Hawaiian Punch and RC Cola. 3 3 3 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Beverage concentrates are shipped to third party bottlers, as well as to our own manufacturing systems, who combine them with carbonation, water, sweeteners and other ingredients, package the combined product in aluminum cans, PET bottles, and glass bottles, and sell them as a packaged beverage to retailers and, ultimately, the end consumer. Beverage concentrates are also manufactured into syrup, which is shipped to fountain customers, such as fast food restaurants, who mix the syrup with water and carbonation to create a finished beverage at the point of sale to consumers. Dr\u00a0Pepper represents most of our fountain channel volume.  Our Beverage Concentrates brands are sold by our bottlers through all major retail channels. As our Beverage Concentrates business is reliant upon a small number of customers, the loss of any of our bottlers in this segment could have a material adverse effect on the segment.  Packaged Beverages Our Packaged Beverages segment is a manufacturing and distribution business of both NCBs and CSDs. Our Packaged Beverages segment also includes a brand ownership business, primarily focusing on our NCB brands. In this segment, we primarily manufacture and distribute packaged beverages of our brands to retailers and, ultimately, the end consumer. Additionally, in order to maximize the size and scale of our manufacturing and distribution operations, we also distribute packaged beverages for our partner brands and manufacture packaged beverages for other third parties in the U.S. and Canada.  The larger CSD brands in this segment include Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, A&W, 7UP, Sunkist, Squirt, Big Red, RC Cola, and Vernors.\u00a0The larger NCB brands in this segment include Mott's, Snapple, Bai, Clamato, Core, Hawaiian Punch, Yoo-Hoo, evian, ReaLemon, Vita Coco and Mr and Mrs T mixers.  The majority of our\u00a0Packaged Beverages net sales come from the manufacturing and distribution of our own brands and the contract manufacturing of certain private label and emerging brand beverages. We also recognize net sales in this segment from the distribution of our partner brands such as evian, Vita Coco, Polar Beverages seltzer water, A Shoc energy drinks, and Peet's RTD coffee. We provide a route-to-market for our partner brands seeking effective distribution for their new and emerging brands. These brands give us exposure in certain markets to fast growing segments of the beverage industry with minimal capital investment. We sell our Packaged Beverages products through our DSD and our WD systems, both of which include sales to all major retail channels. In\u00a02022, Walmart was the Packaged Beverages segment's largest customer. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on the Packaged Beverages segment. Latin America Beverages Our Latin America Beverages segment is a brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business, with operations in Mexico representing approximately 90% of the segment's net sales. This segment participates mainly in the carbonated mineral water, flavored CSD, bottled water and vegetable juice categories. The largest brands include Pe\u00f1afiel, Clamato, Squirt, Mott's, Dr Pepper, Crush and Aguafiel. In 2022, Walmart was the Latin America Beverages segment's largest customer. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on the Latin America Beverages segment. OUR CUSTOMERS We primarily serve the following types of customers:  Retailers Retailers include supermarkets, hypermarkets, mass merchandisers, club stores, e-commerce retailers, office superstores, vending machines, fountains, grocery and drug stores, convenience stores and other small outlets. Retailers purchase finished beverages, K-Cup pods, appliances and accessories directly from us. Our portfolio of strong brands, operational scale and experience in the beverage industry has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with major retailers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In 2022, our largest retailer was Walmart, representing approximately 16% of our consolidated net sales. Bottlers and Distributors In the U.S. and Canada, we generally grant licenses for CSD brands and packages to bottlers for specific geographic areas that are exclusive and long-term, and they have historically been perpetual in many cases. These bottlers may be affiliated with Coca-Cola, with PepsiCo, or may be independent. These agreements prohibit bottlers and distributors from selling the licensed products outside their exclusive territory and selling any imitative products in that territory. Generally, we may terminate bottling and distribution agreements only for cause, change in control or breach of agreements and the bottler or distributor may terminate without cause upon giving certain specified notice and complying with other applicable conditions. Fountain agreements for bottlers generally are not exclusive for a territory, but do restrict bottlers from carrying imitative product in the territory.  4 4 4 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Certain NCB brands, such as Snapple, Bai, Core, Yoo-Hoo, Mistic and Nantucket Nectars are licensed for distribution in various territories to bottlers and a number of smaller distributors such as beer wholesalers, wine and spirit distributors, independent distributors and retail brokers.  Partners We have differentiated ourselves and the Keurig brand through our ability to create and sustain partnerships with other leading coffee, tea and beverage brand companies through multi-year licensing and manufacturing agreements that best suit each brand's interests and strengths. Typically, we manufacture pods on behalf of our partners, who in turn sell them to retailers. As of December 31, 2022, our partner brands included, but were not limited to, Starbucks, Kirkland Signature, Dunkin', Great Value, Peet's, Caribou Coffee, Eight O\u2019Clock, Folgers, Newman\u2019s Own Organics, Tim Hortons, Maxwell House, Kroger, Krispy Kreme, Community Coffee, Intelligensia, BLK & Bold, Celestial Seasonings, Lipton, and Tazo. Away from Home Channel Participants We distribute brewers, accessories and K-Cup pods (owned, licensed, and partner brands) to away from home channel participants, which include restaurants, hotel chains, and office coffee distributors.  End-use Consumers We have a robust e-commerce platform at www.keurig.com where end-use consumers can purchase brewers, accessories, K-Cup pods and other coffee products such as bagged traditional coffee and cold brew.  OUR COMPETITORS The beverage industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences. Competition is generally based on brand recognition, taste, quality, price, availability, selection and convenience, as well as factors related to corporate responsibility and sustainability. We compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources. In our bottling and manufacturing operations, we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers.  The following represents a list of our major competitors: CompetitorCategoriesCoca-ColaCSDs, NCBs, RTD CoffeeThe J.M. Smucker CompanyPackaged CoffeeThe Kraft Heinz CompanyPackaged CoffeeNestl\u00e9 S.A.NCBs, Packaged Coffee, Single-serve brewersPepsiCoCSDs, NCBs, RTD Coffee Although these companies offer competing brands in categories we participate in, they are also our partners and customers, as they purchase beverage concentrates or K-Cup pods directly from us. OUR MATERIAL RESOURCES  Our Raw Materials The principal raw materials we use in our business, which we commonly refer to as ingredients and materials, represent approximately 55% of our cost of sales and include green coffee, PET bottles and caps, including both virgin and rPET, aluminum cans and ends, sweeteners, paper products, K-Cup pod packaging materials, fruit, glass bottles and enclosures, juices, teas, water, CO2, and other ingredients. We also use post-consumer recycled materials in the manufacturing of our single serve brewers. The availability, quality and costs of many of these materials have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time.  When appropriate, we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process and transportation to our customers through the use of various commodity derivative contracts or supplier pricing agreements. The intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure, while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position.  Ingredients and materials, excluding green coffee. Under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials, the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs, such as aluminum in the case of cans and ends, natural gas in the case of glass bottles, resin in the case of pods, PET bottles and caps, corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging.  5 5 5 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Green coffee. We purchase green coffee through outside brokers. We also develop and pursue direct relationships with farms, estates, cooperatives, and cooperative groups in order to support our broader traceability and sustainable supply chain initiatives.  Energy and transportation costs. In addition to ingredients and packaging costs, we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs, which can also fluctuate substantially, due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution operations and the energy costs consumed in the production process. The fuel costs associated with our distribution operations are reflected within our SG&A expenses.  We are also significantly impacted by changes in other transportation costs, such as ocean freight and tariffs. Transportation costs associated with the transportation and import of certain raw materials and finished goods to our manufacturing and distribution facilities are reflected within cost of sales. Our Intellectual Property Trademarks and Patents We possess a variety of intellectual property rights that are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents and trade secrets to safeguard our proprietary rights, including our brands, our technologies, and ingredient and production formulas for our products. We own numerous trademarks in our portfolio within the U.S., Canada, Mexico and other countries. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.  In many countries outside the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the manufacturing and distribution rights to many of our CSD brands, including our Dr Pepper trademark and formula, are owned by third parties including, in certain cases, competitors such as Coca-Cola. We hold U.S. and international patents related to Keurig brewers and K-Cup pod technology. Of these, a majority are utility patents and the remainder are design patents. We view these patents as valuable assets but we do not view any single patent as critical to our success. We also have pending patent applications associated with Keurig brewers and K-Cup pod technology. We take steps that we believe are appropriate to protect such innovation.  Licensing Arrangements We license various trade names from our partners in order to manufacture K-Cup pods. Although these licenses vary in length and other terms, they generally are long-term, cover the entire U.S. and/or Canada and generally include an upfront payment to the partner in order to use their trade names to manufacture and/or distribute the K-Cup pods. For CSDs and NCBs, we license various trademarks from third parties, which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute certain products or brands throughout the U.S. and/or Canada and Mexico. For example, we license trademarks for Sunkist soda, Stewart's, Rose's and Margaritaville from third parties. Although these licenses vary in length and other terms, they generally are long-term, cover the entire U.S. and/or Canada and Mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor. For CSDs and NCBs in emerging and fast growing categories where we may not currently have a brand presence, we license various trademarks from third party partners, which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute certain products or brands throughout the U.S., Canada or Mexico. These partners view us as a distributor with strong route-to-market resources to grow their brands. Although these licenses vary in length and other terms, they generally are long-term, cover the entire U.S. and/or Canada and Mexico, and generally require a payment from the partner if the licensing agreement is terminated. In some instances, we make investments in these companies, which may include a path to acquire the company after a period of time based on a pre-determined formula. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio of partner brands included, but was not limited to, evian water, Polar Beverages seltzer water, Vita Coco coconut water, A Shoc energy drinks, and Peet's RTD Coffee. In December 2022, we also added Nutrabolt\u2019s C4 line of energy drinks to our portfolio, with distribution expected in early 2023.  6 6 6 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  OUR HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Our Employees We have nearly 28,000 employees, primarily located in North America. In the U.S., we have approximately 22,100 employees, of which approximately 5,300 employees are covered by union collective bargaining agreements. In Mexico, we have approximately 4,500 employees, of which approximately 3,000 are covered by union collective bargaining agreements. In Canada, we have approximately 1,400 employees, with approximately 500 covered by union collective bargaining agreements. We also have a small number of employees in Europe and Asia. Our collective bargaining agreements generally address working conditions, as well as wage rates and benefits, and expire over varying terms over the next several years. We generally believe that these agreements can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us as they expire and that we have good relationships with our employees and their representative organizations.  Our compensation programs are designed to ensure that we attract and retain the right talent. We generally review and consider median market pay levels when assessing total compensation, but pay decisions are based on a more comprehensive set of considerations such as company performance, individual performance, experience, and internal equity. We continually monitor key talent metrics including employee engagement and employee turnover.  Our employee benefits programs strive to deliver competitive benefits that are effective in attracting and retaining talent, that create a culture of well-being and inclusiveness, and that meet the diverse needs of our employees. Our total package of benefits is designed to support the physical, mental, and financial health of our employees, and we currently provide access to medical, dental, vision, life insurance and retirement benefits, as well as disability benefits, and assistance with major life activities such as adoption, childbirth, and eldercare, among other benefits.  Our Culture Together with our employees, we created a set of core values that are a unifying force for our team and are the cornerstone of KDP's culture. These core values are: \u2022Team First. Win together. Be the kind of person you want on your team. \u2022Deliver Big. Achieve our commitments. Then push beyond the expected. \u2022Think Bold. Challenge the usual. Dare to try something new. \u2022Be Fearless and Fair. Tell the truth with courage. Listen and act with respect.  Additionally, we have adopted a corporate code of conduct that applies to all of our employees, officers and our Board, which lays the foundation for ethical behavior for our team. Our code of conduct is available on our website at http://www.keurigdrpepper.com. Employee Health and Safety KDP uses a wide variety of strategies and programs to support the health and safety of our employees. From training on risks from non-routine tasks, such as unexpected maintenance on equipment, to installing automated systems to prevent trailers from shifting during loading and unloading, our Environmental Health & Safety team considers all aspects of what our employees may encounter and works to minimize risk. Key to these efforts are data and preventive actions. KDP measures Lost Time Incident Rate, a reliable indication of Total Recordable Injuries Rate severity, and uses a risk reduction process that thoroughly analyzes injuries and near misses. Diversity and Inclusion In 2020, we began to focus on accelerating our work in the area of diversity and inclusion, and we made significant progress, despite the pandemic. We approached this effort as we approach critical business priorities, using our playbook from integration and transformation initiatives. As part of this process, we established executive-level governance, including participation by our Chairman and CEO, as well as a Diversity and Inclusion leadership team, comprised of committed leaders from across KDP to help set priorities and lead two-way dialogue throughout the organization, and launched our Employee Resource Groups, among other initiatives.   7 7 7 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Global Employee Snapshot as of December 31, 2022  U.S. Employee Snapshot as of December 31, 2022  SEASONALITY OF OUR BUSINESS The beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. Our cold beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months, while hot beverage sales are generally higher during the cooler months. Overall beverage sales can also be influenced by the timing of holidays and weather fluctuations. Sales of brewers and related accessories are generally higher during the second half of the year due to the holiday shopping season. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS In the normal course of our business, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. Regulations apply to many aspects of our business, including our products and their ingredients, manufacturing, safety, labeling, transportation, recycling, advertising and sale. For example, our products and their manufacturing, labeling, marketing and sale in the U.S. are subject to various aspects of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Robinson-Patman Act, the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws, such as Proposition 65. Certain cities and municipalities within the U.S. have also passed various taxes on the distribution of sugar-sweetened and diet beverages, which are at different stages of enactment. In Canada, Mexico and the European Union, the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of many of our products are also subject to similar statutes and regulations. Various states, provinces and other authorities require deposits, eco-taxes, extended producer responsibility laws, or fees on certain products or packaging. Similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the U.S. and elsewhere. In Mexico, the government has encouraged the beverage industry to comply voluntarily with collection and recycling programs for plastic materials, and we are in compliance with these programs. 8 8 8 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY We are committed to acting responsibly, and our ambition is to ensure our beverages make a positive impact with every drink. Drink Well. Do Good. is our corporate responsibility platform. Under this platform, we focus on our greatest opportunities for impact in our supply chain, the environment, our people and communities, and on the health and well-being of our consumers. We are committed to transparency and disclosure of corporate responsibility strategies, programs, progress and governance. Our Corporate Responsibility Report, which is issued annually, is available on our website at www.keurigdrpepper.com.  Environment Circular Economy Sustainable packaging is a top priority for us, and we continue to innovate for circular solutions across our portfolio. We contribute to the circular economy via our public goals to convert our packaging to be recyclable or compostable and to use more post-consumer recycled content across our packaging portfolio, including plastics.  Improving packaging solutions for product quality, consumer use, recoverability and reuse requires collaboration of all parties along the value chain. Using our strength in forming partnerships, we collaborate closely with a number of stakeholders, including industry groups, non-governmental organizations and coalitions, to move our commitments beyond independent ambitions to collective action. Climate Change KDP is working to address climate change and build the resilience of our business and supply chain. Our approach includes a corporate policy, governance structures and transparency. Our targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and are in line with the reductions that are required to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. Our climate goals provide a path for us to reduce our share of greenhouse gas emissions from our 2018 baseline through continuation of existing efforts, like improving energy efficiency in our operations, and the development of new focus areas, such as packaging improvements and value chain engagement. We report non-financial data annually on our climate efforts to CDP Climate. Water Stewardship Water is a precious natural resource that is essential to our business. As water is the primary ingredient in most of our beverages, we have a particular responsibility to be good stewards of water use in our operations, our communities and throughout our supply chain. Our water stewardship goals are focused on safeguarding water resources and building healthy communities resilient to climate change. We conduct periodic water risk assessments of our operations and supply chain. To refine our understanding of challenges for our high water-risk sites, we assess each site in the context of the surrounding watershed, the local water issues and other local entities\u2019 interest and perspective on those issues. We have public goals and programs to both increase operational efficiency and to replenish water through conservation and restoration projects with conservation organizations in communities where we operate that have high water risk. We report non-financial data annually on our water stewardship efforts to CDP Water. Supply Chain We identify key suppliers, farmers and business partners to encourage sustainable practices across our supply chain. We are committed to responsibly sourcing coffee, cocoa, and other priority crops, relying on third-party certifications and verification programs to foster social, environmental and economic protections. We aim to responsibly source manufactured products by prioritizing and engaging key suppliers to implement and maintain effective social and environmental management systems in their own operations. We continue to build out new programs focused on supporting regenerative agriculture and conservation in our coffee, corn and apple supply chains, as well as advancing inclusion and improving livelihoods for the people in KDP\u2019s upstream supply chain. Our participation in the Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition continues to inform our efforts around an inclusive sourcing approach for KDP. Health and Well-Being We are committed to providing a balanced portfolio of beverage options and the resources consumers need to make informed choices for positive hydration, including an expansion of our product offerings that deliver nutritional and functional benefits, as well as reducing sugar and calories. We have dramatically transformed our portfolio over the past decade, offering a low- or no-calorie option for virtually every full-calorie brand in our portfolio, and we have also added smaller portion-size offerings. In 2022, we launched our updated KDP Product Facts website, found at www.kdpproductfacts.com, which contains important nutrition, certification, and allergen information to empower consumers to make informed decisions and find products that meet their needs. 9 9 9 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  OTHER INFORMATION Our website address is www.keurigdrpepper.com.
