{"cik": 906163, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business. General NVR, Inc., a Virginia corporation, was formed in 1980 as NVHomes, Inc. Our primary business is the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings, all of which are primarily constructed on a pre-sold basis. To more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations, we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business. We conduct our homebuilding activities directly. Our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary, NVR Mortgage Finance, Inc. (\u201cNVRM\u201d). Unless the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cNVR\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d include NVR, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are one of the largest homebuilders in the United States. We operate in thirty-five metropolitan areas in fifteen states, and Washington, D.C.  Our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings under three trade names: Ryan Homes, NVHomes and Heartland Homes. Our Ryan Homes product is marketed primarily to first-time and first-time move-up buyers. Ryan Homes operates in thirty-five metropolitan areas located in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Tennessee. Our NVHomes and Heartland Homes products are marketed primarily to move-up and luxury buyers. NVHomes operates in Delaware and the Washington, D.C., Baltimore, MD and Philadelphia, PA metropolitan areas. Heartland Homes operates in the Pittsburgh, PA metropolitan area.  During 2022, approximately 16% of our home settlements accounting for approximately 21% of our homebuilding revenue occurred in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  We generally do not engage in land development (see discussion below of our land development activities). Instead, we typically acquire finished building lots from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price finished lot purchase agreements (\u201cLPAs\u201d) that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the LPAs. The deposits required under the LPAs are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and typically range up to 10% of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots. We believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development. We may, at our option, choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these LPAs by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract. Our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these LPAs is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the LPAs. We do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these LPAs. None of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these LPAs have recourse to our general credit. We generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our five-year business plan. In addition to constructing homes primarily on a pre-sold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy, we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve. This strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets, which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets. Our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build. As a result, in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development. Once we acquire control of raw ground, we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into an LPA with the developer to purchase the finished lots or hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf. While joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots, we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so. We expect, however, to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using LPAs with forfeitable deposits. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of lots controlled.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, see Notes 3, 4 and 5 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding LPAs, joint ventures and land under development, respectively. In addition to building and selling homes, we provide a number of mortgage-related services through our mortgage banking operations. Through operations in each of our homebuilding markets, NVRM originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers. NVRM generates revenues primarily from origination fees, gains on sales of loans and title fees. NVRM sells almost all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis. Segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in Note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 1 1 1 Table of Contents Table of Contents Homebuilding Products We offer single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings with many different home designs. These home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options. Our homes combine traditional, transitional, cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities, generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1,000 to 10,000 finished square feet. During 2022, the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately $160,000 to $2.6 million and averaged $454,300. During 2021, our average price of homes settled was $403,900. Markets Our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions: Mid Atlantic:\u00a0Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware and Washington, D.C.North East:\u00a0New Jersey and Eastern PennsylvaniaMid East:\u00a0New York, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, Indiana and IllinoisSouth East:\u00a0North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida and Georgia  Backlog Backlog, which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer, totaled 9,162 units and approximately $4.3 billion at December\u00a031, 2022 compared to 12,730 units and approximately $5.8 billion at December\u00a031, 2021. The average price of homes in backlog increased to $472,200 at December\u00a031, 2022 from $454,200 at December\u00a031, 2021. Backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control, such as the customer\u2019s failure to obtain mortgage financing, inability to sell an existing home, job loss or a variety of other reasons. In any period, a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period, and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period. Expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period, our cancellation rate was 14.2%, 9.2% and 14.9% in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  During the four quarters of each of 2022, 2021 and 2020, approximately 4% in 2022, 3% in 2021 and 6% in 2020 of a reporting quarter\u2019s opening backlog cancelled during the quarter.  We can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods. Other than those units that are cancelled, and subject to potential construction delays due to continued supply chain disruptions, we expect to settle substantially all of our December\u00a031, 2022 backlog during 2023. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item\u00a01A and \u201cSeasonality\u201d in Item\u00a07 of this Form 10-K. Further discussion of settlements, new orders and backlog activity by our homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item\u00a07 of this Form 10-K. Construction We utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes. We use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors. Sales and Marketing Our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many built-in options and a landscaped lot. The garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review. Sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis. Regulation We and our subcontractors must comply with various federal, state and local zoning, building, environmental, advertising and consumer credit statutes, rules and regulations, as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities. All of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products, and in some instances, have delayed our developers\u2019 ability to deliver finished lots to us. Counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards. In addition, our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. To date, restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities. 2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents Competition and Market Factors The housing industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater financial resources than we do. We also face competition from the home resale market. Our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service and reputation. Historically, we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes. The housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels, prevailing economic conditions and interest rates. Other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include: the availability and the cost of land, labor and materials; changes in consumer preferences; demographic trends; and the availability of mortgage finance programs. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item\u00a01A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these risks. We are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials. Whenever possible, we utilize standard products available from multiple sources. In the past, such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply, however, increased construction activity and demand for building materials, coupled with the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to supply chain disruptions and longer construction cycle times during 2021 and 2022.  Mortgage Banking We provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations. Our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees. Because NVRM originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers, NVRM is dependent on our homebuilding segment. In 2022, NVRM closed approximately 17,000 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $6.3 billion as compared to approximately 17,700 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $6.1 billion in 2021.  NVRM\u2019s mortgage loans in process that had not closed had an aggregate principal balance of approximately $2.5 billion as of  December\u00a031, 2022 compared to approximately $3.9 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021.  NVRM sells almost all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis, typically within 30 days from the loan closing. NVRM is an approved seller/servicer for Fannie Mae (\u201cFNMA\u201d) and Freddie Mac (\"FHLMC\") mortgage loans and an approved seller/issuer of Ginnie Mae (\u201cGNMA\u201d), Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) and Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d) mortgage loans. Regulation NVRM is subject to the rules and regulations of FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC, VA and FHA. These rules and regulations restrict certain activities of NVRM. NVRM is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs. In addition, NVRM is subject to regulation at the state and federal level, including regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d) with respect to specific origination, selling and servicing practices. Competition and Market Factors NVRM\u2019s main competition comes from national, regional, and local mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, credit unions and banks in each of these markets. NVRM competes primarily on the basis of customer service, variety of products offered, interest rates offered, prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs.  Human Capital As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 6,550 full time employees, of whom approximately 5,500 worked in our homebuilding operations, and approximately 1,050 worked in our mortgage banking operations, compared to December\u00a031, 2021, when we had approximately 6,600 full time employees, of whom approximately 5,600 worked in our homebuilding operations, and approximately 1,000 worked in our mortgage banking operations.  None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our employees are our most important asset.  We are committed to hiring and developing an inclusive workplace with a strong diversity of backgrounds and perspectives. All of our employees must adhere to our code of ethics and standards of business conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior in the workplace.  Our compensation philosophy has been consistent for over 25 years and is designed to motivate and retain highly qualified and experienced employees.  We provide tools for the advancement of our employees by offering training and development opportunities that align with each employee\u2019s responsibilities and career path. We strive to promote employees from within our workforce, as we believe this provides both long-term success and continuity to our operations and growth for our employees. Our focus is demonstrated by the tenure of our executives and our regional and division leaders.   3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents Available Information We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).
