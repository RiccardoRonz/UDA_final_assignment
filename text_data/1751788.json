RAW MATERIALS The Company operates in an integrated manufacturing environment. Basic raw materials are processed through many stages to produce a number of products that are sold as finished goods at various points in those processes. The major raw material stream that feeds the production of the Company's finished goods is hydrocarbon-based raw materials. The Company purchases hydrocarbon-based raw materials including ethane, propane, butane, naphtha and condensate as feedstocks. These raw materials are used in the production of both saleable products and energy. The Company also purchases and sells certain monomers, primarily ethylene and propylene, to balance internal production and internal consumption. The Company purchases natural gas, primarily to generate electricity, and purchases electric power to supplement internal generation. In addition, the Company produces a portion of its electricity needs in Louisiana and Texas; Alberta, Canada; The Netherlands; and Germany.   The Company's primary source of these raw materials are natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\"), which are derived from natural gas and crude oil production, and naphtha, which is produced during the processing and refining of crude oil. Given recent advancements in shale gas, shale oil and conventional drilling techniques, the Company expects these raw materials to be in abundant supply. The Company's suppliers of these raw materials include regional, international and national oil and gas companies.  The Company purchases raw materials on both short- and long-term contracts. The Company had adequate supplies of raw materials in 2022 and expects to continue to have adequate supplies of raw materials in 2023.   INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION RESULTS See Note\u00a025 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding net sales, Operating EBIT and total assets by segment, as well as net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region.   SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS All products and services are marketed primarily through the Company\u2019s sales force, although in some instances more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. In 2022, no significant portion of the Company's sales was dependent upon a single customer.   PATENTS, LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS The Company continually applies for and obtains U.S. and foreign patents and has a substantial number of pending patent applications throughout the world. At December\u00a031, 2022, the Company owned approximately 3,700 active U.S. patents and 22,600 active foreign patents as follows:   Remaining Life of Patents Owned at Dec 31, 2022United StatesRest of WorldWithin 5 years600\u00a03,200\u00a06 to 10 years1,100\u00a07,000\u00a011 to 15 years1,500\u00a010,800\u00a016 to 20 years500\u00a01,600\u00a0Total3,700\u00a022,600\u00a0  The Company\u2019s primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect the results of its research for use in operations and licensing. The Company is party to a substantial number of patent licenses, including intellectual property cross-license agreements and other technology agreements, and also has a substantial number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries, including the \u201cDow in Diamond\u201d trademark. Although the Company considers that its patents, licenses and trademarks in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, it does not regard its business as being materially dependent on any single or group of related patents, licenses or trademarks. 14 14 14  Table of Contents Table of Contents  PRINCIPAL PARTLY OWNED COMPANIES The Company\u2019s principal nonconsolidated affiliates at December\u00a031, 2022, including direct and indirect ownership interest for each, are listed below:  Principal Nonconsolidated AffiliateCountryOwnership InterestBusiness DescriptionEQUATE Petrochemical Company K.S.C.C.

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY Dow is working to deliver a sustainable future by collaborating and innovating to expand its ability to make a positive impact on society and the planet. As a leading materials science company, Dow has the responsibility and opportunity to act and lead the industry in areas where Dow's science and innovation can make a difference. This means Dow is reducing its environmental footprint, developing and implementing circular economy solutions, and creating new materials that are more sustainable. Dow\u2019s sustainability strategy focuses on three areas, which address some of the most pressing challenges facing the planet and offer the most opportunity for Dow to use its science and global scale to make a positive impact.  Climate Protection \u2013 Dow is committed to protecting the planet by combating climate change, including contributing to a lower-carbon future, both in its operations and value chains. Dow\u2019s comprehensive strategy includes actions to optimize the Company's manufacturing facilities and processes for sustainability, increase clean energy in Dow's purchased power mix, collaborate with the Company's supply chain to address upstream carbon emissions, invest in transformative next-generation solutions for climate protection, and develop low carbon products, technologies and services.  Circular Economy \u2013 Dow is taking a leading role in driving a more circular economy by designing for circularity, transforming plastic waste and alternative feedstock into circular and renewable solutions, building new business models for circular materials, and partnering in an industrial ecosystem to end plastic waste.   Safer Materials \u2013 Dow is innovating new materials that offer a more favorable health and environmental profile over their life cycles compared to incumbent solutions. Dow believes that creating safer materials is a continuous journey and is possible through innovation, design and more predictive, enabling technologies. Dow\u2019s innovations must meet the needs of customers and society, and Dow is committed to continue to evolve its approach to safer materials in line with these expectations.  15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Climate Protection, Circular Economy and Safer Materials are critical to Dow\u2019s license to operate and represent areas where Dow is using its science, scale and global relationships across value chains to create shared opportunity for Dow and society. To accelerate the Company's sustainability commitments, Dow has implemented and continues to expand on its multi-decade targets intended to put the Company on a path to achieve carbon neutrality and eliminate plastic waste, which include the following: \u2022By 2030, Dow will reduce its net annual Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 5 million metric tons compared with its 2020\u00a0baseline, representing a 15 percent reduction from 2020 and a 30 percent reduction since 2005. \u2022By 2050, Dow intends to be carbon neutral (Scope 1+2+3 plus product benefits).   \u2022By 2030, Dow will transform plastic waste and other forms of alternative feedstock to commercialize 3\u00a0million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually. To do this, Dow will expand its efforts to stop the waste by building industrial ecosystems to collect, reuse or recycle waste and expand its portfolio to meet rapidly growing demand. Dow expects the waste required to produce this target will surpass and replace its original 1 million metric tons stop the waste goal.  The Company's progress in achieving these targets is reviewed regularly by management and with the Environment, Health, Safety & Technology Committee of the Dow Inc. Board of Directors (\"Board\").   Additional discussion of matters pertaining to the environment, including actions related to the Company's sustainability strategy, is included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors; Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

HUMAN CAPITAL Dow\u2019s ambition \u2013 to be the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world - starts with people. Dow employees create innovative and sustainable materials science solutions to advance the world. Every answer starts with asking the right questions. This is why the diverse, dedicated Dow team collaborates with customers and other stakeholders to find solutions to the world's toughest challenges. The Company's values of Respect for People, Integrity and Protecting Our Planet are fundamental beliefs that are ingrained in each action taken, can never be compromised and are the foundation of the Company's Code of Conduct.  The Company is dedicated to employee health and safety and is invested in fostering a culture of inclusion and continuous learning while supporting its employees through its Total Rewards plans and programs to ensure all Dow employees are respected, valued and encouraged to make their fullest contribution.   Safety, Employee Health and Well-Being A commitment to safety and employee health is ingrained in Dow\u2019s culture and central to how the Dow team works. Dow uses a comprehensive, integrated operating discipline management system that includes policies, requirements, best practices and procedures associated with health and safety. In 2022, the Company achieved an Occupational Safety and Health Administration Total Recordable Injury and Illness Rate of 0.16, based upon the number of incidents per 200,000 work hours for employees and contractors globally. This measure, along with a consistent set of globally applied, as well as locally defined, leading indicators of safety performance, are cornerstones of Dow's worker protection program. The Company maintains a robust, globally tracked near-miss program for situations that did not result in an injury, but could have been high consequence had circumstances been slightly different. This data is reviewed regularly by management and the Environment, Health, Safety & Technology Committee of the Board, is visible to all employees and is built into digital dashboards that include actual injury information for every Dow location around the world.   As part of the Company\u2019s total worker health strategy, employees have access to occupational health services at no cost through on-site, Company-managed clinics at its manufacturing locations or an offsite provider overseen by Dow Occupational Health. In addition to access for occupational health needs, the Company also has a comprehensive well-being strategy, which is framed across four dimensions \u2013 physical, mental, community and financial well-being \u2013 for an approach that is holistic, global, employee centered and outcome-driven. Key ambitions  16 16 16 Table of Contents Table of Contents  across the four dimensions focus on elements such as workplace stress, psychological safety, resiliency, workload, healthy eating and activities, and social community and inclusion opportunities.  Dow maintains active Crisis Management Teams at the corporate level and in each region where the Company operates to ensure appropriate plans are in place in the event of natural disasters or other emergencies.  Inclusion, Diversity & Equity At Dow, inclusion, diversity and equity (\u201cID&E\u201d) is a business imperative evidenced by inclusion serving as a core pillar of the Company's ambition statement. A strategic and intentional focus on ID&E not only enhances the employee experience and satisfaction, but it also supports innovation, customer experience and understanding of the communities the Company serves. In 2022, Dow advanced to #15 in the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity and for the second year in a row was named to the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For\u00ae list. These are significant accomplishments that represent only two of the many awards the Company received related to its efforts in ID&E.   Dow's strategic ID&E efforts are directed by its Chief Inclusion Officer and Office of Inclusion, which supports implementation throughout Dow\u2019s businesses, functions and regions. Three Inclusion Councils drive the ID&E strategy from the top of the Company down and across the enterprise: \u2022The President\u2019s Inclusion Council defines and supports Dow's ID&E strategy from the top. \u2022A Senior Leaders\u2019 Inclusion Council influences change through senior and mid-level business, geographic and functional leaders. \u2022A Joint Inclusion Council collaborates to drive maximum employee engagement through Employee Resource Group (\u201cERG\u201d) leadership.   Dow\u2019s 10 ERGs are representative of the Company\u2019s diverse workforce and help foster an inclusive workplace. Dow\u2019s ERGs are organized around historically underrepresented groups including women, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities and veterans, as well as groups both for professionals who are new to the Company and those who are 50 years or older. Senior leaders serve as executive sponsors for each ERG. In addition, Dow has a Paid Time Off Policy which provides employees time off to volunteer and engage in ERG activities. In 2022, 57 percent of Dow\u2019s workforce and 98 percent of Dow people leaders participated in at least one ERG.   Inclusion and diversity metrics, including ERG participation, global representation of women and U.S. ethnic minority representation in the United States, are published internally on a quarterly basis, are embedded in the same scorecard where Dow\u2019s financial and safety results are measured and are directly connected to leaders\u2019 annual performance and compensation. This data is reviewed regularly by management and with the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board.  Global pay disparity studies have been conducted at Dow for over 20 years to assess fair treatment between genders and between U.S. ethnic minorities and non-minorities and to ensure Dow\u2019s pay practices are being implemented as intended. As part of Dow\u2019s ID&E efforts, the Company will continue to conduct annual pay gap studies and actively engage with an external partner to further develop and continue to apply best practices.  Total Rewards To achieve Dow\u2019s ambition to be the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world, the Company invests in its people, who are at the heart of the Company, through its Total Rewards plans and programs. The Total Rewards plans and programs are structured to attract, retain and motivate Dow\u2019s employees. Dow\u2019s Total Rewards are designed to support all aspects of its employees \u2013 their compensation, future, health, life and career. The Company is committed to aligning its strategy and culture with the needs of its employees and optimizing the investment Dow makes in Total Rewards.    17 17 17 Table of Contents Table of Contents  As a global company with a diverse team, Dow aims to ensure employees have access to resources that allow them to meet their unique needs. That is why Dow has established three guiding principles that define its Total Rewards strategy: 1) ensuring programs are market competitive, while leading peer companies in equitable and inclusive offerings; 2) providing employees with offerings that align with their preferences; and 3) offering programs that promote fulfilling career and life experiences. Dow adapts its programs for geography-specific requirements, as well as cultural standards and expectations.  Employee Engagement, Learning and Development Throughout an employee\u2019s career, the Company supports development through a blend of learning approaches including in-person and virtual trainings, digital learning platforms, on-the-job training and a series of leadership development programs. Annually, all employees have the opportunity to provide feedback on employee experience and offer insights into how to improve Dow\u2019s working culture through a global employee opinion survey. A key component of the survey is an opportunity for employees to provide feedback on the effectiveness of their direct leader. In 2022, 72 percent of employees responded to the annual survey. The feedback received through this annual survey and additional quarterly checkpoint surveys is used to drive actions to improve the overall Dow experience for employees across the Company, as well as to support continuous improvement in leader effectiveness.  At December\u00a031, 2022, the Company permanently employed approximately 37,800 people on a full-time basis.       *U.S. Minority includes employees who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or two or more races.
