Marketing. Our insurance group\u2019s products are marketed principally through a group of licensed independent retail and wholesale brokers. Clients (insureds) are referred to our insurance group through a large number of international, national and regional brokers and captive managers who receive from the insured or insurer a set fee or brokerage commission usually equal to a percentage of gross premiums. Our insurance group may enter into contingent commission arrangements with some brokers that provided for the payment of additional commissions based on volume or profitability of business. Currently, some of our contracts with brokers provide for additional commissions based on volume. It is the practice for the brokers and producers to make the client aware of any contingent commissions arrangements that may be in place with us. We have also entered into service agreements with select international brokers that provide access to their proprietary industry analytics. In general, our insurance group has no implied or explicit commitments to accept business from any particular broker and neither brokers nor any other third parties have the authority to bind our insurance group, except in the case where underwriting authority may be delegated contractually to select program administrators.

ARCH CAPITAL72022 FORM 10-K ARCH CAPITAL72022 FORM 10-K  ARCH CAPITAL72022 FORM 10-K 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Maintain a low cost structure. Our reinsurance group believes that maintaining tight control over its staffing level and operating primarily as a broker market reinsurer permits it to maintain low operating costs relative to its capital and premiums.Our reinsurance group writes business on both a proportional and non-proportional basis and writes both treaty and facultative business. In a proportional reinsurance arrangement (also known as pro rata reinsurance, quota share reinsurance or participating reinsurance), the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured. The reinsurer pays the cedent a commission which is generally based on the cedent\u2019s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured (including commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative expenses) and may also include a profit factor. Non-proportional (or excess of loss) reinsurance indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified portion of losses on underlying insurance policies in excess of a specified amount, which is called a \u201cretention.\u201d Non-proportional business is written in layers and a reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a band of coverage up to a specified amount. The total coverage purchased by the cedent is referred to as a \u201cprogram.\u201d Any liability exceeding the upper limit of the program reverts to the cedent.The reinsurance group\u2019s treaty operations generally seek to write significant lines on less commoditized classes of coverage, such as specialty property and casualty reinsurance treaties. However, with respect to other classes of coverage, such as property catastrophe and casualty clash, the reinsurance group\u2019s treaty operations participate in a relatively large number of treaties where they believe that they can underwrite and process the business efficiently. The reinsurance group\u2019s property facultative operations write reinsurance on a facultative basis whereby they assume part of the risk under primarily single insurance contracts. Facultative reinsurance is typically purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties, for unusual risks or for amounts in excess of the limits on their reinsurance treaties.For additional information regarding the business written by the reinsurance group, please refer to note 4, \u201cSegment Information,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.Underwriting Philosophy. Our reinsurance group employs a disciplined, analytical approach to underwriting reinsurance risks that is designed to specify an adequate premium for a given exposure commensurate with the amount of capital it anticipates placing at risk. A number of our reinsurance group\u2019s underwriters are also actuaries. It is our reinsurance group\u2019s belief that employing actuaries on the front-end of the underwriting process gives it an advantage in evaluating risks and constructing a high quality book of business.As part of the underwriting process, our reinsurance group typically assesses a variety of factors, including:\u2022adequacy of underlying rates for a specific class of business and territory;\u2022the reputation of the proposed cedent and the likelihood of establishing a long-term relationship with the cedent, the geographic area in which the cedent does business, together with its catastrophe exposures, and our aggregate exposures in that area;\u2022historical loss data for the cedent and, where available, for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions, in order to compare the cedent\u2019s historical loss experience to industry averages; \u2022projections of future loss frequency and severity; and \u2022the perceived financial strength of the cedent. Marketing. Our reinsurance group generally markets its reinsurance products through brokers, except our property facultative reinsurance group, which generally deals directly with the ceding companies. Brokers do not have the authority to bind our reinsurance group with respect to reinsurance agreements, nor does our reinsurance group commit in advance to accept any portion of the business that brokers submit to them. Our reinsurance group generally pays brokerage fees to brokers based on negotiated percentages of the premiums written through such brokers. For information on major brokers, see note 18, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u2014Concentrations of Credit Risk,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.Risk Management and Retrocession. Our reinsurance group currently purchases a combination of per event excess of loss, per risk excess of loss, proportional retrocessional agreements and other structures that are available in the market. Such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses on, and in certain cases may also increase the underwriting capacity of, our reinsurance group. Our reinsurance group will continue to evaluate its retrocessional requirements based on its net appetite for risk. See note 8, \u201cReinsurance,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.For catastrophe exposed reinsurance business, our reinsurance group seeks to limit the amount of exposure it assumes from any one reinsured and the amount of the aggregate exposure to catastrophe losses from a single event in any one geographic zone.

Our reinsurance group generally pays brokerage fees to brokers based on negotiated percentages of the premiums written through such brokers. For information on major brokers, see note 18, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u2014Concentrations of Credit Risk,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Risk Management and Retrocession. Our reinsurance group currently purchases a combination of per event excess of loss, per risk excess of loss, proportional retrocessional agreements and other structures that are available in the market. Such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses on, and in certain cases may also increase the underwriting capacity of, our reinsurance group. Our reinsurance group will continue to evaluate its retrocessional requirements based on its net appetite for risk. See note 8, \u201cReinsurance,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For catastrophe exposed reinsurance business, our reinsurance group seeks to limit the amount of exposure it assumes from any one reinsured and the amount of the aggregate exposure to catastrophe losses from a single event in any one geographic zone.

ARCH CAPITAL92022 FORM 10-K ARCH CAPITAL92022 FORM 10-K  ARCH CAPITAL92022 FORM 10-K 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our mortgage group focuses on the following areas:\u2022Direct mortgage insurance in the United States. Under their monoline insurance licenses, each of Arch\u2019s eligible mortgage insurers may only offer private mortgage insurance covering first lien, one-to-four family residential mortgages. Nearly all of our mortgage insurance written provides first loss protection on loans originated by mortgage lenders and sold to the GSEs. Each GSE\u2019s Congressional charter generally prohibits it from purchasing a mortgage where the principal balance of the mortgage is in excess of 80% of the value of the property securing the mortgage unless the excess portion of the mortgage is protected against default by lender recourse, participation or by a qualified insurer. As a result, such \u201chigh loan-to-value mortgages\u201d purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac generally are insured with private mortgage insurance.Mortgage insurance protects the insured lender, investor or GSE against loss in the event of a borrower\u2019s default. If a borrower defaults on mortgage payments, private mortgage insurance reduces, and may eliminate, losses to the insured. Private mortgage insurance may also facilitate the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market because of the credit enhancement it provides. Our primary U.S. mortgage insurance policies predominantly cover individual loans and are effective at the time the loan is originated. We also may enter into insurance transactions with lenders and investors, under which we insure a portfolio of loans at or after origination. Although not currently a significant product, we may offer mortgage insurance on a \u201cpool\u201d basis in the future. Under pool insurance, the mortgage insurer provides coverage on a group of specified loans, typically for 100% of all contractual or policy-defined losses on every loan in the portfolio, subject to an agreed aggregate loss limit. Pool insurance may be in a first loss position with respect to loans that do not have primary mortgage insurance policies, or it may be in a second loss position, covering losses in excess of those covered by the primary mortgage insurance policy. \u2022Mortgage insurance and reinsurance in Europe and other countries where we identify profitable underwriting opportunities. Since 2011, Arch Insurance (EU) has offered mortgage insurance to European mortgage lenders in order to reduce lenders\u2019 credit risk and regulatory capital requirements associated with the insured mortgages. In certain European countries, lenders purchase mortgage insurance to facilitate regulatory compliance with respect to high loan-to-value residential lending. Arch Insurance (EU) offers mortgage insurance on both a \u201cflow\u201d basis to cover new originations and through structured transactions to cover one or more portfolios of previously originated residential loans. Increasingly, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Re Bermuda are providing protection to European banks on structured capital relief transactions. In Australia, Arch Indemnity provides lenders\u2019 mortgage insurance on a flow basis to cover new originations and offers coverage through structured transactions to cover one or more portfolios of previously originated residential loans.\u2022Reinsurance. Arch Re Bermuda provides quota share reinsurance covering U.S. and international mortgages. \u2022Other credit risk-sharing products. In addition to providing traditional mortgage insurance and reinsurance, we offer various credit risk-sharing products to government agencies and mortgage lenders. The GSEs have reduced their exposure to mortgage risk by shifting a portion of it to the private sector, creating opportunities for insurers to assume additional mortgage risk. In 2013, Arch Re Bermuda became the first (re)insurance company to participate in Freddie Mac\u2019s program to transfer certain credit risk in its single-family portfolio to the private sector. Since that time, Arch Re Bermuda and its affiliates have regularly participated in both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac single family and multifamily risk sharing programs.In 2019 we established Arch Credit Risk Services (Bermuda) (\u201cArch CRS\u201d) Ltd. Arch CRS is licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (\u201cBMA\u201d) as an insurance agent in Bermuda. Arch CRS offers mortgage credit assessment and underwriting advisory services with respect to participation in GSE credit risk transfer transactions. Underwriting Philosophy. Our mortgage group believes in a disciplined, analytical approach to underwriting mortgage risks by utilizing proprietary and third party models, including forecasting delinquency and future home price movements with the goal of ensuring that premiums are adequate for the risk being insured. Experienced actuaries and statistical modelers are engaged in analytics to inform the underwriting process. As part of the underwriting process, our mortgage group typically assesses a variety of factors, including the:\u2022ability and willingness of the mortgage borrower to pay its obligations under the mortgage loan being insured;\u2022characteristics of the mortgage loan being insured and the value of the collateral securing the mortgage loan;\u2022financial strength, quality of operations and reputation of the lender originating the mortgage loan;\u2022expected future home price movements which vary by geography; Our mortgage group focuses on the following areas:\u2022Direct mortgage insurance in the United States.

In the U.S., we employ a sales force to directly sell mortgage insurance products and services to our customers, which include mortgage originators such as mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and community banks. Our largest single mortgage insurance customer in the U.S. (including branches and affiliates) accounted for 7.1% and 6.3% of our gross premiums written for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No other customer accounted for greater than 2.8% of the gross premiums written for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The percentage of gross premiums written on our top 10 customers was 23.6% and 22.7% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In Europe, Bermuda and Australia, our products and services are/or will be distributed on a direct basis and through brokers. Each country represents a unique set of opportunities and challenges that require knowledge of market conditions and client needs to develop effective solutions.Risk Management. Exposure to mortgage risk is monitored globally and managed through underwriting guidelines, pricing, reinsurance, utilization of proprietary risk models, concentration limits and limits on net probable loss resulting from a severe economic downturn in the housing market. Exposure to climate risk has also been incorporated into the risk management framework of our mortgage group to monitor and manage our exposure to potential (i) losses related to the direct physical impact of extreme weather conditions or events in certain transactions; and/or (ii) adverse economic or housing market conditions caused by the physical impact of extreme weather conditions or events on a region or the financial impact of transitioning to a zero or low carbon economy on a region. Generally, mortgage insurance policies exclude direct physical losses resulting from physical damages, such as damaged caused by extreme weather events, though we do have some exposure to physical damage in certain GSE credit risk transfer (\u201cCRT\u201d) transactions. Additionally, we actively monitor developments in the housing market, financial regulation and public policy in the geographies where our mortgage group operates to facilitate implementation of laws, regulations and policies which support sustainable environmental behavior and mitigate the effects of climate change. For a discussion of our risk management policies, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\u2014Ceded Reinsurance\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to Our Industry, Business and Operations\u2014The failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\u201d Our mortgage group has ceded a portion of its premium on a quota share basis through certain reinsurance agreements and through aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreements which provide reinsurance coverage for delinquencies on portfolios of in-force policies issued between certain periods. See note 8, \u201cReinsurance,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further details.Reinsurance arrangements do not relieve our mortgage group from its primary obligations to insured parties. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets, predicated on the reinsurers\u2019 ability to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements. If the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements, our mortgage subsidiaries would be liable for such defaulted amounts. For our U.S. mortgage insurance business, in addition to utilizing reinsurance, we have developed a proprietary risk model that simulates the maximum loss resulting from severe economic events impacting the housing market. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Catastrophic Events and Severe Economic Events.\u201dClaims Management. With respect to our direct mortgage insurance business, the claims process generally begins with notification by the insured or servicer to us of a default on an insured loan. The insured is generally required to notify us of a default after the borrower misses two consecutive monthly payments. Borrowers default for a variety of reasons, including a reduction of income, unemployment, divorce, illness, inability to manage credit, rising interest rate levels and declining home prices. Upon notice of a default, in certain cases we may coordinate with loan servicers to facilitate and enhance retention workouts on insured loans. Retention workouts include payment forbearance, loan modifications and other loan repayment options, which may enable borrowers to cure mortgage defaults and retain ownership of their homes. If a retention workout is not viable for a borrower, our loss on a loan may be mitigated through a liquidation workout option, including a pre-foreclosure sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. In the U.S., our master policies generally provide that within 60 days of the perfection of a primary insurance claim, we have the option of: \u2022paying the insurance coverage percentage specified in the certificate of insurance multiplied by the loss amount; \u2022in the event the property is sold pursuant to an approved prearranged sale, paying the lesser of (i) 100% of the loss amount less the proceeds of sale of the property, or (ii) the specified coverage percentage multiplied by the loss amount; or  \u2022projections of future loss frequency and severity; and\u2022adequacy of premium rates.Sales and Distribution. In the U.S., we employ a sales force to directly sell mortgage insurance products and services to our customers, which include mortgage originators such as mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and community banks. Our largest single mortgage insurance customer in the U.S. (including branches and affiliates) accounted for 7.1% and 6.3% of our gross premiums written for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No other customer accounted for greater than 2.8% of the gross premiums written for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The percentage of gross premiums written on our top 10 customers was 23.6% and 22.7% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In Europe, Bermuda and Australia, our products and services are/or will be distributed on a direct basis and through brokers. Each country represents a unique set of opportunities and challenges that require knowledge of market conditions and client needs to develop effective solutions.Risk Management. Exposure to mortgage risk is monitored globally and managed through underwriting guidelines, pricing, reinsurance, utilization of proprietary risk models, concentration limits and limits on net probable loss resulting from a severe economic downturn in the housing market. Exposure to climate risk has also been incorporated into the risk management framework of our mortgage group to monitor and manage our exposure to potential (i) losses related to the direct physical impact of extreme weather conditions or events in certain transactions; and/or (ii) adverse economic or housing market conditions caused by the physical impact of extreme weather conditions or events on a region or the financial impact of transitioning to a zero or low carbon economy on a region. Generally, mortgage insurance policies exclude direct physical losses resulting from physical damages, such as damaged caused by extreme weather events, though we do have some exposure to physical damage in certain GSE credit risk transfer (\u201cCRT\u201d) transactions. Additionally, we actively monitor developments in the housing market, financial regulation and public policy in the geographies where our mortgage group operates to facilitate implementation of laws, regulations and policies which support sustainable environmental behavior and mitigate the effects of climate change.

By better reflecting the demographics in the markets in which we operate while also actively instilling norms for inclusive behavior, we leverage all the best contributions and thinking across our Company. To that end, we are committed to further integrating diversity and inclusion principles in our operations. In addition to \u201cembedding\u201d inclusion into our talent processes, e.g., promotion reviews, over 500 employees (mostly managers) have attended our intensive, six-week Fostering Inclusive Leadership program. Importantly, this program requires participants to complete a business-related project as well as attend group discussions, where participants focus on how to apply inclusive techniques into the work experience. Finally, in 2022 our six employee networks provided a forum for over 1,000 employees to share ideas, build community and belonging, provide leadership opportunities for members, and contribute meaningfully to business outcomes.

Our employees are our greatest asset, and we maintain a sharp focus on improving the ways we attract, develop and retain our high-performing talent. Our goal is to cultivate a workplace culture where all our employees can thrive by building awareness of inclusive practices and incorporating them into our regular course of business. We continue to enhance our talent acquisition process through a new model which will modernize our approach to talent acquisition for candidates and hiring managers, while providing an enhanced ability to proactively source and build pipelines for the best diverse talent. The model will help streamline this process across our Company by using a common platform and approach, which we can easily scale as we grow.We provide unique career growth opportunities through a combination of on-the-job training, exposure to top-notch colleagues who coach and mentor, and education and training programs designed to accelerate learning and applying new skills and behaviors. We offer competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits packages, including an employee share purchase plan, parental leave, generous contributions to retirement savings plans and programs to support employee mental and physical well-being. We recognize the financial burden of educational loans in the United States and have supported our employees with a student debt assistance program. Since the inception of the program in 2018, Arch has contributed $4.1 million to this program, including $0.9 million in 2022. We also match eligible contributions to qualified charitable organizations and employees are eligible to receive time-off to volunteer with an eligible non-profit organization. Our Arch Achieve program has recognized over 400 employees for excellence since its inception in 2009, and each recipient is awarded shares of our common stock (or a cash bonus in certain cases), to recognize their accomplishments.In 2022, our senior leadership team was able to meet in person to dive deep into our business strategy and recruitment and employee retention strategy and enhance opportunities for employee development and networking opportunities globally.In the U.S., we lowered the cost of benefits for many employees based on a tiered salary approach for the fall 2022 enrollment period. This is meant to address some of the impacts of inflation in 2023 for many employees who are hit the hardest by rising prices.We also encourage employees to continue their educational and professional development through tuition reimbursement plans. To attract the best talent to our industry, we offer internship programs and an Early Career Program with an Underwriting Track which provides participants with a robust introduction and real technical skills to build a successful career at Arch. As part of our talent attraction, we have targeted programs aimed at diversifying our workforce. Experienced professionals at Arch may participate in manager and leadership development programs and, for our mortgage insurance segment employees, we offer the opportunity to seek a Mortgage Bankers Association Certified Banker designation. RESERVESReserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses (\u201cLoss Reserves\u201d) represent estimates of what the insurer or reinsurer ultimately expects to pay on claims at a given time, based on facts and circumstances then known, and it is probable that the ultimate liability may exceed or be less than such estimates. Even actuarially sound methods can lead to subsequent adjustments to reserves that are both significant and irregular due to the nature of the risks written. Loss Reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty. For detail on our Loss Reserves by segment and potential variability in the reserving process, see the Loss Reserves section of \u201cSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d in Item 7.

The model will help streamline this process across our Company by using a common platform and approach, which we can easily scale as we grow.We provide unique career growth opportunities through a combination of on-the-job training, exposure to top-notch colleagues who coach and mentor, and education and training programs designed to accelerate learning and applying new skills and behaviors. We offer competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits packages, including an employee share purchase plan, parental leave, generous contributions to retirement savings plans and programs to support employee mental and physical well-being. We recognize the financial burden of educational loans in the United States and have supported our employees with a student debt assistance program. Since the inception of the program in 2018, Arch has contributed $4.1 million to this program, including $0.9 million in 2022. We also match eligible contributions to  wellness needs of our employees. We provided additional resources including webinars with a psychologist who specializes in building resilience and continued our Arch Cares program to provide financial support to employees affected by COVID-19.  An important part of our culture is building an inclusive, diverse workforce. By better reflecting the demographics in the markets in which we operate while also actively instilling norms for inclusive behavior, we leverage all the best contributions and thinking across our Company. To that end, we are committed to further integrating diversity and inclusion principles in our operations. In addition to \u201cembedding\u201d inclusion into our talent processes, e.g., promotion reviews, over 500 employees (mostly managers) have attended our intensive, six-week Fostering Inclusive Leadership program. Importantly, this program requires participants to complete a business-related project as well as attend group discussions, where participants focus on how to apply inclusive techniques into the work experience. Finally, in 2022 our six employee networks provided a forum for over 1,000 employees to share ideas, build community and belonging, provide leadership opportunities for members, and contribute meaningfully to business outcomes. Importantly, our networks include significant ally representation, which underscores the inclusive behavior of our people. Talent Acquisition, Development, Rewards and Retention.

Enterprise Risk Management (\u201cERM\u201d) is a key element in our philosophy, strategy and culture. We employ an ERM framework that includes underwriting, reserving, investment, credit and operational risks. Risk appetite and exposure limits are set by our executive management team, reviewed with the Board and its committees and routinely discussed with business unit management. These limits are articulated in our risk appetite statement, which details risk appetite, tolerances and limits for each major risk category, and are integrated into our operating guidelines. Exposures are aggregated and monitored periodically by our corporate risk management team. The reporting, review and approval of risk management information is integrated into our annual planning process, capital modeling and allocation, reinsurance purchasing strategy and reviewed at insurance business reviews, reinsurance underwriting meetings and board level committees.Risk Management Process and Procedures. The following narrative provides an overview of our risk management framework and our methodology for identifying, measuring, managing and reporting on the key risks affecting us. It outlines our approach to risk identification and assessment and provides an overview of our risk appetite and tolerance for each of the following major risks: underwriting (insurance) risk including pricing, reserving and catastrophe; investment including market and liquidity risks; group risk including strategic, governance, rating agency and capital market risk; credit risk; and operational risk, including regulatory, investor relations (reputational risk) and outsourcing risks. We view environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) \u2013 related risks not as standalone risks but as an integral part of our enterprise-wide risk management strategy. Consequently, evaluations of these risks are embedded throughout our risk management framework.The framework includes details of our risk philosophy and policies to address the material risks confronting us and the approach and procedures to control and or mitigate these risks. The actions and policies implemented to meet our business management and regulatory obligations form the core of this framework. We have adopted a holistic approach to risk management by analyzing risk from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective.Risk Identification and Assessment. The Finance, Investment and Risk Committee (\u201cFIR Committee\u201d), Audit Committee and Underwriting Oversight Committee of the Board oversee the top-down and bottom-up review of our risks.

Arch Capital\u2019s Chief Risk Officer (\u201cCRO\u201d) assists these committees in the identification and assessment of all key risks. The CRO is responsible for maintaining Arch Capital\u2019s risk register and continually reviewing and challenging risk assessments, including the impact of emerging risks and significant business developments. Any new high-level risks or change in inherent or residual designations are brought to the Board\u2019s or the relevant committee\u2019s attention.Risk Monitoring and Control. Arch Capital\u2019s risk management framework requires risk owners to monitor key risks on a continuous basis. The highest residual risks are actively managed by the Board and relevant committees. The remaining risks are managed and monitored at a process level by the risk owners and/or the CRO. Risk owners have ultimate responsibility for the day-to-day management of each designated risk, reporting to the CRO on the satisfactory management and control of the risk and timely escalation of significant issues that may arise in relation to that risk. The CRO is responsible for overseeing the monitoring of all risks across the business and for communicating to the relevant risk owners if she becomes aware of issues, or potential and actual breaches of risk appetite, relevant to the assigned risks. A key element of these monitoring activities is the periodic evaluation of our position relative to risk tolerances and limits approved by the Board. state government agencies that sponsor their own mortgage insurance programs.

Any new high-level risks or change in inherent or residual designations are brought to the Board\u2019s or the relevant committee\u2019s attention.Risk Monitoring and Control. Arch Capital\u2019s risk management framework requires risk owners to monitor key risks on a continuous basis. The highest residual risks are actively managed by the Board and relevant committees. The remaining risks are managed and monitored at a process level by the risk owners and/or the CRO. Risk owners have ultimate responsibility for the day-to-day management of each designated risk, reporting to the CRO on the satisfactory management and control of the risk and timely escalation of significant issues that may arise in relation to that risk. The CRO is responsible for overseeing the monitoring of all risks across the business and for communicating to the relevant risk owners if she becomes aware of issues, or potential and actual breaches of risk appetite, relevant to the assigned risks. A key element of these monitoring activities is the periodic evaluation of our position relative to risk tolerances and limits approved by the Board. (insurance) risk including pricing, reserving and catastrophe; investment including market and liquidity risks; group risk including strategic, governance, rating agency and capital market risk; credit risk; and operational risk, including regulatory, investor relations (reputational risk) and outsourcing risks. We view environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) \u2013 related risks not as standalone risks but as an integral part of our enterprise-wide risk management strategy. Consequently, evaluations of these risks are embedded throughout our risk management framework. The framework includes details of our risk philosophy and policies to address the material risks confronting us and the approach and procedures to control and or mitigate these risks. The actions and policies implemented to meet our business management and regulatory obligations form the core of this framework. We have adopted a holistic approach to risk management by analyzing risk from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective. Risk Identification and Assessment. The Finance, Investment and Risk Committee (\u201cFIR Committee\u201d), Audit Committee and Underwriting Oversight Committee of the Board oversee the top-down and bottom-up review of our risks. Given the nature and scale of our operations, these committees consider all aforementioned risks within the scope of the assessment.

Quarterly, the CRO compiles the results of the key risk review process into a report to the Board and relevant committees for review and discussion at their next meeting. The report includes an overview of selected key risks; a risk dashboard that depicts the status of risk limit and tolerance metrics; changes in the rating of high-level risks in the Arch Capital risk register; and summaries of our largest exposures and reinsurance recoverables. If necessary, risk management matters reviewed at the committee meetings are presented for discussion by the Board. The CRO is responsible for immediately escalating any significant risk matters to executive management, the respective Board Committee and/or the Board for approval of the required remediation. As part of our corporate governance, the Board and certain of its committees hold regular executive sessions with members of our management team. These sessions are intended to ensure an open and frank dialogue exists about various forms of risk across the organization.Implementation and Integration. We believe that an integrated approach to developing, measuring and reporting our Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (\u201cORSA\u201d) is an important part of the risk management framework. The ORSA process provides the link between Arch Capital\u2019s risk profile, its board-approved risk appetite including approved risk tolerances and limits, its business strategy and its overall solvency requirements. The ORSA is the entirety of the processes and procedures employed to identify, assess, monitor, manage, and report the short and long-term risks we face or may face and to determine the capital necessary to ensure that our overall solvency needs are met at all times. The ORSA also makes the link between actual reported results and the capital assessment.The ORSA is the basis for risk reporting to the Board and its committees and acts as a mechanism to embed the risk management framework within our decision making processes and operations. The Board has delegated responsibility for supervision and oversight of the ORSA to the FIR Committee. This oversight includes regular reviews of the ORSA process and output. An ORSA report is produced at least annually and the results of each assessment are reported to the Board. The Board actively participates in the ORSA process by steering how the assessment is performed and challenging its results. This assessment is also taken into account when formulating strategic decisions.The ORSA process and reporting are also important parts of our business strategy, tailored specifically to fit into our organizational structure and risk management system with the appropriate techniques in place to assess our overall solvency needs, taking into consideration the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the business.We also take the results of the ORSA into account within our system of governance, including long-term capital management, business planning and new product development. The results of the ORSA also contribute to various elements of our strategic decision-making including how best to optimize capital management, establishing the most appropriate premium levels and deciding whether to retain or transfer risks.

The minimum solvency margin, which varies depending on the class of the insurer, is determined as a percentage of either net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses (\u201cLAE\u201d) or premiums or pursuant to a risk-based capital measure. Arch Re Bermuda is also subject to an enhanced capital requirement (\u201cECR\u201d) which is established by reference to either the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement model (\u201cBSCR\u201d) or an approved internal capital model. The BSCR model is a risk-based capital model which provides a method for determining an insurer\u2019s capital requirements (statutory capital and surplus) by taking into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the insurer\u2019s business. The BMA has established a target capital level for each Class 4 insurer equal to 120% of its ECR. While a Class 4 insurer is not currently required to maintain its available statutory economic capital and surplus at this level, the target capital level serves as an early warning tool for the BMA, and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the target capital level will likely result in increased regulatory oversight. As a Class C insurer, Arch Re Bermuda is also required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus in respect of its long-term business at a level equal to or in excess of its long-term enhanced capital requirement that is established by reference to either the Class C BSCR model or an approved internal capital model.Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if it is in breach of its general business or long-term business enhanced capital requirements, minimum solvency margins or its general business minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividends would cause such a breach. If it has failed to meet its minimum solvency margins or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, Arch Re Bermuda will be prohibited, without the approval of the BMA, from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year. In addition, Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year\u2019s statutory balance sheet) unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins. Without the approval of the BMA, Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital as set out in its previous year\u2019s financial statements and any application for such approval must include an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins. Where such an affidavit is filed, it shall be available for public inspection at the offices of the BMA. Under the Bermuda Companies Act of 1981, as amended (the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d), Arch Re Bermuda may declare or pay a dividend out of distributable reserves only if it has reasonable grounds for believing that it is, or would after the payment be, able to pay its liabilities as they become due and if the realizable value of its assets would thereby not be less than its liabilities. Policyholder Priority. The Insurance Amendment (No. 2) Act 2018 amended the Insurance Act to provide for the prior payment of policyholders\u2019 liabilities ahead of general unsecured creditors in the event of the liquidation or winding up of an insurer. The amendments provide inter alia that, subject to certain statutorily preferred debts, the insurance debts of an insurer must be paid in priority to all other unsecured debts of the insurer. Insurance debt is defined as a debt to which an insurer is or may become liable pursuant to an insurance contract excluding debts owed to an insurer under an insurance contract where the insurer is the person insured.Group Supervision. The BMA acts as group supervisor of our group of insurance and reinsurance companies (\u201cGroup\u201d) and has designated Arch Re Bermuda as the designated insurer (\u201cDesignated Insurer\u201d). As our Group supervisor, the BMA performs a number of functions including: (i) coordinating the gathering and dissemination of relevant or essential information for going concerns and emergency situations, including the dissemination of information which is of importance for the supervisory task of other competent authorities; (ii) carrying out supervisory reviews and assessments of our Group; (iii) carrying out assessments of our Group's compliance with the rules on solvency, risk concentration, intra-group transactions and good governance procedures; (iv) planning and coordinating through regular meetings held at least annually (or by other appropriate means) with other competent authorities, supervisory activities in respect of our Group; both as a going concern and in emergency situations (v) coordinating any enforcement action that may need to be taken against our Group or any Group members; and (vi) planning and coordinating meetings of colleges of supervisors in order to facilitate the carrying out of these functions. As Designated Insurer, Arch Re Bermuda is required to facilitate compliance by our Group with the group insurance solvency and supervision rules.On an annual basis, the Group is required to file Group statutory financial statements, a Group statutory financial return, a Group capital and solvency return, audited Group financial statements, a Group Solvency Self-Assessment (\u201cGSSA\u201d), and a financial condition report with the BMA. The GSSA is designed to document our perspective on the capital resources necessary to achieve our business strategies and remain solvent, and to provide the BMA with insights on our risk management, governance procedures and documentation related to this process. In addition, the Designated Insurer is required to file quarterly group financial returns with the BMA. The Group is also required to maintain available Group statutory economic capital and  amount of relevant liabilities.

Our U.S. based insurance operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they are domiciled, licensed and/or approved to conduct business. The insurance laws and regulations of the state of domicile have the most significant impact on operations. We currently have U.S. insurance and/or reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in Delaware, North Carolina, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas and the District of Columbia and we may acquire insurers domiciled in other states in the future. State insurance regulation and supervision is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors. Generally, state regulatory authorities have broad regulatory powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, premium rates, policy forms, marketing practices, claims practices, investments, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, certain aspects of governance, ERM, amounts we are required to hold as reserves for future payments, minimum capital and surplus requirements, annual and other report filings and transactions among affiliates. Our U.S. based subsidiaries are required to file detailed quarterly and audited annual statutory financial statements with state insurance regulators. In addition, regulatory authorities conduct periodic financial, claims and market conduct examinations. Certain insurance regulatory requirements are highlighted below. In addition to regulation applicable generally to U.S. insurance and reinsurance companies, our U.S. mortgage insurance operations are affected by federal and state regulation relating to mortgage insurers, mortgage lenders, and the origination, purchase and sale of residential mortgages. Arch Insurance (U.K.) is also subject to certain governmental regulation and supervision in the states where it writes excess and surplus lines insurance.Holding Company Regulation. All states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. These regulations generally provide that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. Notice to the state insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system and certain transactions may not be consummated without the applicable insurance department\u2019s prior approval or non-disapproval after receiving notice. The holding company acts also prohibit any person from directly or indirectly acquiring control of a U.S. insurance or reinsurance company unless that person has filed an application with specified information with such company\u2019s domiciliary commissioner and has obtained the commissioner\u2019s prior approval. Under most states\u2019 statutes acquiring 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered an acquisition of control of the insurance company, although such presumption may be rebutted. State holding company acts and regulations also impose extensive informational requirements on parents and other affiliates of licensed insurers or reinsurers with the purpose of protecting them from enterprise risk, including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed companies and requiring a person divesting its controlling interest to make a confidential advance notice filing.The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) Insurance Holding Company System Model Act and Model Regulation includes provisions that, when adopted by states, will require the ultimate controlling person of an insurance holding company system to file an annual group capital calculation, unless the ultimate controlling person or its insurance holding company system is exempt from the filing requirement. The group capital calculation is designed to assist state insurance regulators in understanding the financial condition of non-insurance entities that are part of an insurance holding company system and the degree to which insurance companies are supporting those non-insurance entities.Regulation of Dividends and Other Payments from Insurance Subsidiaries. The ability of an insurer to pay dividends or make other distributions is subject to insurance regulatory limitations of the insurer\u2019s state of domicile.

The ORSA Model Act also provides that, no more than once a year, an insurer\u2019s domiciliary regulator may request that an insurer submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and/or the insurance group of which it is a member. States may impose additional internal review and regulatory filing requirements on licensed insurers and their parent companies. All states have enacted the ORSA Model Act or substantially similar legislation.Cybersecurity and Privacy. The NAIC has adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, requires insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to comply with certain requirements under state insurance laws, such as developing and maintaining a written information security program, conducting risk assessments and overseeing the data security practices of third-party vendors and meeting expanded breach notification requirements. This model law has been adopted in states in which our U.S. subsidiaries are licensed and operate. In addition, certain state insurance regulators are developing or have developed regulations that may impose regulatory requirements relating to cybersecurity on insurance and reinsurance companies (potentially including insurance and reinsurance companies that are not domiciled, but are licensed, in the relevant state). Many regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), the New York Department of Financial Services (\u201cNYDFS\u201d), and the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), have issued new guidance on managing cybersecurity risks which expand existing regulatory requirements. Additional guidance and rules relating cybersecurity that are applicable to us are expected, especially from NYDFS.In March 2022, the U.S. government passed the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, which will require companies deemed to be part of U.S. critical infrastructure to report any substantial cybersecurity incidents or ransom payments to the federal government within 72 and 24 hours, respectively. The implementing regulations are not expected for another two-to-three years. In addition, on March 9, 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to certain rules regarding cybersecurity disclosure in order to standardize and enhance disclosures made by public companies. Such rulemaking undertakes to expand security incident reporting requirements and may subject public companies to additional and uncertain requirements in the event of an actual or perceived security incident.Privacy legislation and regulation has also become an issue of increasing focus in many states. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), came into effect on January 1, 2020, and grants California consumers certain rights to, among other things, access and delete data about them subject to certain exceptions, as well as a private right of action related to cybersecurity breaches with statutory penalties. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed as part of the November 2020 ballot and became fully effective on January 1, 2023. The CPRA applies to some of our data collecting and processing activities, and it provides for additional consumer privacy rights, and additional regulatory obligations over certain data. It also created a new privacy focused California regulatory agency with enforcement authority, the California Privacy Protection Agency (\u201cCPPA\u201d). The CPPA is also currently finalizing proposed regulations implementing the CPRA, and  allowed if the reinsurer is licensed or \u201caccredited\u201d in the state in which the primary insurer is domiciled; or if none of the above applies, to the extent that the reinsurance obligations of the reinsurer are collateralized appropriately, typically through the posting of a letter of credit for the benefit of the primary insurer or the deposit of assets into a trust fund established for the benefit of the primary insurer. U.S. primary insurers also may receive credit for reinsurance ceded to unauthorized reinsurers without collateral or with less than 100% collateral under revisions to the NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785) and the Credit for Reinsurance Model Regulation (#786) (collectively, the \u201cNAIC Model Law and Regulation\u201d). All U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have adopted revisions to the NAIC Model Law and Regulation that allow full credit to U.S. ceding insurers for reinsurance ceded to reinsurers that have been approved as \u201ccertified reinsurers\u201d based upon less than 100% collateralization. As of February 23, 2023, Arch Re Bermuda is approved as a \u201ccertified reinsurer\u201d in 44 states with applications pending in 8 additional states and territories. In addition, 2019 amendments to the NAIC Model Law and Regulation eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements for reinsurers that (1) have their head office or are domiciled in member states of the EU, the U.K. and other jurisdictions deemed \u201creciprocal jurisdictions\u201d by the NAIC (although individual states may reject the designation of such other jurisdictions as a \u201creciprocal jurisdiction\u201d), and (2) have been approved as a \u201creciprocal jurisdiction reinsurer.\u201d The NAIC list of reciprocal jurisdictions includes Bermuda, Japan and Switzerland. All U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have adopted the 2019 amendments to the NAIC Model Law and Regulation. As of February 23, 2023, Arch Re Bermuda is approved as a \u201creciprocal jurisdiction reinsurer\u201d in 45 states with applications pending in 7 additional states and territories. Risk Management and ORSA. The NAIC Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Assessment Model Act (\u201cORSA Model Act\u201d) provides that domestic insurers, or their insurance group, must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to the ORSA Guidance Manual process. The ORSA Model Act also provides that, no more than once a year, an insurer\u2019s domiciliary regulator may request that an insurer submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and/or the insurance group of which it is a member. States may impose additional internal review and regulatory filing requirements on licensed insurers and their parent companies. All states have enacted the ORSA Model Act or substantially similar legislation.Cybersecurity and Privacy. The NAIC has adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, requires insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed  allowed if the reinsurer is licensed or \u201caccredited\u201d in the state in which the primary insurer is domiciled; or if none of the above applies, to the extent that the reinsurance obligations of the reinsurer are collateralized appropriately, typically through the posting of a letter of credit for the benefit of the primary insurer or the deposit of assets into a trust fund established for the benefit of the primary insurer.  U.S. primary insurers also may receive credit for reinsurance ceded to unauthorized reinsurers without collateral or with less than 100% collateral under revisions to the NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785) and the Credit for Reinsurance Model Regulation (#786) (collectively, the \u201cNAIC Model Law and Regulation\u201d).

States may impose additional internal review and regulatory filing requirements on licensed insurers and their parent companies. All states have enacted the ORSA Model Act or substantially similar legislation. Cybersecurity and Privacy. The NAIC has adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, requires insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed   under state insurance laws to comply with certain requirements under state insurance laws, such as developing and maintaining a written information security program, conducting risk assessments and overseeing the data security practices of third-party vendors and meeting expanded breach notification requirements. This model law has been adopted in states in which our U.S. subsidiaries are licensed and operate. In addition, certain state insurance regulators are developing or have developed regulations that may impose regulatory requirements relating to cybersecurity on insurance and reinsurance companies (potentially including insurance and reinsurance companies that are not domiciled, but are licensed, in the relevant state). Many regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), the New York Department of Financial Services (\u201cNYDFS\u201d), and the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), have issued new guidance on managing cybersecurity risks which expand existing regulatory requirements.

The American Data Privacy and Protection Act introduced in the U.S. Congress, if enacted, would also apply to our U.S. operations. Several states, including Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, have adopted new comprehensive data privacy legislation that is coming into effect in 2023. While these state laws provide consumer privacy rights and protections like those in the CCPA and CPRA, they exempt entities subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act from their requirements.Risk-Based Capital Requirements. Licensed U.S. property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies are subject to risk-based capital requirements that are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. The risk-based capital model for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: underwriting, which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; declines in asset values arising from credit risk; and declines in asset values arising from investment risks. An insurer will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending on how its statutory surplus compares to its risk-based capital calculation. Under the approved formula, an insurer\u2019s total adjusted capital is compared to its authorized control level risk-based capital. If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no company or regulatory action is necessary. Below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurer\u2019s domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to risk-based capital requirement decreases. The mildest regulatory action requires an insurer to submit a plan for corrective action; the most severe requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated. Our mortgage insurance operations are not currently subject to state risk-based capital requirements, but rather are subject to state risk to capital or minimum policyholder position requirements. The NAIC has established a Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Working Group which is engaged in developing changes to the Mortgage Guaranty Insurers Model Act, including the development of supplemental disclosures schedules unique to mortgage guaranty insurers. Guaranty Funds. Most states require all admitted insurance companies to participate in their respective guaranty funds which cover certain claims against insolvent insurers. Solvent insurers licensed in these states are required to cover the losses paid on behalf of insolvent insurers by the guaranty funds and are generally subject to annual assessments in the states by the guaranty funds to cover these losses. Mortgage guaranty insurance, among other lines of business, is typically exempt from participation in guaranty funds.Climate Change and Financial Risks. U.S. state insurance regulators have increased their oversight of insurance company governance, reporting and disclosure relating to the potential risks presented by climate change and one or more states may adopt climate-change-related requirements that impact our insurance and reinsurance companies. In 2020, NYDFS issued a circular letter stating that NYDFS expects insurers authorized in New York to integrate the consideration of climate risks into their governance frameworks, risk management processes and business strategies, including the designation of a board committee or member and senior management function to be accountable for the company\u2019s assessment and management of the financial risks from climate change. In 2021, NYDFS issued additional Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change that reiterates many of the principles outlined in the 2020 circular letter. New York and other states also require licensed insurers with countrywide premium written of at least $100 million to annually provide disclosure of their assessment and management of climate related risks.Federal Regulation. Although state regulation is the dominant form of regulation for insurance and reinsurance business, a number of federal laws affect and apply to the insurance industry. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank\u201d) created the Federal Insurance Office (\u201cFIO\u201d) within the Department of Treasury (\u201cU.S. Treasury\u201d), which is not a federal regulator or supervisor of insurance, but monitors the insurance industry for systemic risk, administers the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (\u201cTRIP\u201d), consults with the states regarding insurance matters, develops federal policy on aspects of international insurance matters, and is authorized to assist the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in negotiating \u201ccovered agreements\u201d between the U.S. and foreign governments that address insurance prudential measures. In 2022 and 2021, the FIO requested public comment on insurance responses to climate-related financial risks and catastrophic cyber incidents affecting critical infrastructure. This information gathering could culminate in recommendations for new legislation to the U.S. Congress. On October 18, 2022, the FIO issued a proposed data collection from insurers to assess climate related financial risk across the United States. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to Our Industry, Business and Operations\u2014We could face unanticipated losses from war, terrorism, cyber attacks, pandemics and political instability, and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\u201d for more information on TRIP. is mandated by the CPRA to adopt additional regulations that have yet to be proposed.A range of new cybersecurity and privacy laws are also under consideration in other states, as well as by the federal government.

ARCH CAPITAL212022 FORM 10-K ARCH CAPITAL212022 FORM 10-K  ARCH CAPITAL212022 FORM 10-K 21 Table of Contents Table of Contents Certain other federal laws also directly or indirectly impact mortgage insurers, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Truth In Lending Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Among other things, these laws and their implementing regulations prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business, require fairness and non-discrimination in granting or facilitating the granting of credit, govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information, define the manner in which companies may pursue collection activities, and require disclosures of the cost of credit and provide for other consumer protections.GSE Eligible Mortgage Insurer Requirements. GSEs impose requirements on private mortgage insurers so that they may be eligible to insure loans sold to the GSEs, known as the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (\u201cPMIERs\u201d). The PMIERs apply to our eligible mortgage insurers, but do not apply to Arch Mortgage Guaranty Company, which is not GSE-approved. The PMIERs impose limitations on the type of risk insured, the forms and insurance policies issued, standards for the geographic and customer diversification of risk, procedures for claims handling, acceptable underwriting practices, standards for certain reinsurance cessions and financial requirements, among other things. The financial requirements require an eligible mortgage insurer\u2019s available assets, which generally include only the most liquid assets of an insurer, to meet or exceed \u201cminimum required assets\u201d as of each quarter end. Minimum required assets are calculated from PMIERs tables with several risk dimensions (including origination year, original loan-to-value, original credit score of performing loans, and the delinquency status of non-performing loans). Russian Sanctions. The U.S. first imposed sanctions on the Russian Federation following its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Since February 2022, the U.S. has imposed additional sanctions on Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing hostilities. Given the evolving situation, we are closely monitoring developments and the sanctions imposed, to ensure our business remains in compliance with any applicable sanctions measures imposed.CanadaArch Insurance Canada and Arch Re Canada are subject to federal, as well as provincial and territorial, regulation in Canada in the provinces and territories in which they underwrite insurance/reinsurance. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (\u201cOSFI\u201d) is the federal regulatory body that, under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), prudentially regulates federal Canadian and non-Canadian insurance and reinsurance companies operating in Canada. Arch Insurance Canada is licensed to carry on insurance business by OSFI and in each province and territory. Arch Re Canada is licensed to carry on reinsurance business by OSFI and in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec.Under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), Arch Insurance Canada is required to maintain an adequate amount of capital in Canada, calculated in accordance with a test promulgated by OSFI called the Minimum Capital Test, and Arch Re Canada is required to maintain an adequate margin of assets over liabilities in Canada, calculated in accordance with a test promulgated by OSFI called the Branch Adequacy of Assets Test. OSFI has implemented a risk-based methodology for assessing insurance/reinsurance companies operating in Canada known as its \u201cSupervisory Framework.\u201d In applying the Supervisory Framework, OSFI considers the inherent risks of the business and the quality of risk management for each significant activity of each operating entity. Under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), approval of the Minister of Finance (Canada) is required in connection with certain acquisitions of shares of, or control of, Canadian insurance companies such as Arch Insurance Canada, and notice to and/or approval of OSFI is required in connection with the payment of dividends by or redemption of shares by Canadian insurance companies such as Arch Insurance Canada.United Kingdom General.

In May 2004, Arch Insurance (U.K.) was granted the relevant permissions for the classes of insurance business which it underwrites in the U.K. AMAL currently manages Arch Syndicate 2012 and Arch Syndicate 1955 pursuant to its authorizations by the U.K. regulators and Lloyd\u2019s. All U.K. companies are also subject to a range of statutory provisions, including the laws and regulations of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended) (the \u201cU.K. Companies Act\u201d).The objectives of the PRA are to promote the safety and soundness of all firms it supervises and to secure an appropriate degree of protection for policyholders. The objectives of the FCA are to ensure customers receive financial services and products that meet their needs, to promote sound financial systems and markets and to ensure that firms are stable and resilient with transparent pricing information and which compete effectively and have the interests of their customers and the integrity of the market at the heart of how they run their business.

Among other things, these laws and their implementing regulations prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business, require fairness and non-discrimination in granting or facilitating the granting of credit, govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information, define the manner in which companies may pursue collection activities, and require disclosures of the cost of credit and provide for other consumer protections.GSE Eligible Mortgage Insurer Requirements. GSEs impose requirements on private mortgage insurers so that they may be eligible to insure loans sold to the GSEs, known as the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (\u201cPMIERs\u201d). The PMIERs apply to our eligible mortgage insurers, but do not apply to Arch Mortgage Guaranty Company, which is not GSE-approved. The PMIERs impose limitations on the type of risk insured, the forms and insurance policies issued, standards for the geographic and customer diversification of risk, procedures for claims handling, acceptable underwriting practices, standards for certain reinsurance cessions and financial requirements, among other things. The financial requirements require an eligible mortgage insurer\u2019s available assets, which generally include only the most liquid assets of an insurer, to meet or exceed \u201cminimum required assets\u201d as of each quarter end. Minimum required assets are calculated from PMIERs tables with several risk dimensions (including origination year, original loan-to-value, original credit score of performing loans, and the delinquency status of non-performing loans).

The U.K. government commenced a post-Brexit review of Solvency II in June 2020. The response to the review, published in early July 2021, suggested that there will likely be changes in the U.K. Solvency II framework, including the removal of certain prescriptive requirements. In parallel, the PRA also undertook a review of Solvency II and, launched a quantitative study which contained both quantitative studies and qualitative questions intended to guide future reforms of Solvency II in the U.K. Additionally, the U.K. government had undertaken a Future Regulatory Framework Review to determine how the financial services regulatory framework should adapt to the U.K.\u2019s new position outside of the EU. On April 28, 2022, HM Treasury announced a third consultation period for Solvency II, which will inform the design of the final reform package.

The result of these reviews by the U.K. government may have an impact on whether the U.K. is granted Solvency II equivalence status by the EU in any of the three areas to which equivalence applies.Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (\u201cFSCS\u201d) is a scheme established under FSMA to compensate eligible policyholders of insurance companies who may become insolvent. The FSCS is funded by the levies that it has the power to impose on all insurers. Arch Insurance (U.K.) could be required to pay levies to the FSCS.Restrictions on Acquisition of Control. Under FSMA, the prior consent of the PRA or FCA, as applicable, is required, before any person can become a controller or increase its control over any regulated company, including Arch Insurance (U.K.), or over the parent undertaking of any regulated company. Therefore, the PRA's or FCA's prior consent, as applicable, is required before any person can become a controller of Arch Capital. Prior consent is also required from Lloyd\u2019s before any person can become a controller or increase its control over a corporate member or a managing agent or a parent undertaking of a corporate member or managing agent. A controller is defined for these purposes as a person who holds (either alone or in concert with others) 10% or more of the shares or voting power in the relevant company or its parent undertaking.Restrictions on Payment of Dividends.

Lloyd\u2019s Brussels is seeking to ensure that the claims it pays and complaints it processes preserve the objectives of policyholder protection and market discipline under the Insurance Distribution Directive. The U.K. government established a Temporary Permissions Regime (\u201cTPR\u201d) which came into force with effect from January 1, 2021, which allows EEA firms such as Arch Re Europe and Arch Insurance (EU), covered by a passport prior to that date, who wish to continue carrying out business in the U.K. in the longer term, to operate in the U.K. for a limited period while they seek authorization or recognition from the U.K. regulators. However, no TPR-equivalent regime is in place for U.K. firms who wish to continue carrying out business in the EEA. In the absence of a TPR-equivalent regime for U.K. firms, the ability of U.K. firms (including, Arch Insurance (U.K.), AMAL and Castel) to continue doing business in the EEA depends on applicable EEA state local law and regulation.

The report also found an absence of EU equivalence decisions over financial services, which will determine how London will fit into the EU market post-Brexit. Overall, the EA Committee called on the U.K. government to step up its political and diplomatic engagement with the EU regarding financial services.

As part of those efforts, on January 17, 2022, the U.K. passed mandatory climate related financial disclosure requirements under the Companies (Strategic Report) (Climate-related Financial Disclosure) Regulations 2022. The regulations apply to large companies (including some of our U.K. entities) for financial years starting on or after April 6, 2022. The regulations generally align risk disclosures (aligned with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d)).In 2021, the U.K. government published its Greening Finance Roadmap to Sustainable Investing (the \u201cRoadmap\u201d), which announced proposals to extend the scope of the U.K.\u2019s sustainable finance framework beyond climate change. Further to the Roadmap, the FCA issued a consultation paper in November 2022 on its proposed regime of Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (\u201cSDR\u201d), which would require corporate disclosures, asset manager and asset owner disclosures, and investment product disclosures covering a broader range of sustainability topics. The SDR rules are expected to be finalized in the first half of 2023, with disclosures applying from 2024 and reporting commencing in 2025.In October 2022, the Green Technical Advisory Group (\"GTAG\") published its advice to the U.K. government on the development of the U.K. Green Taxonomy. Whilst not binding, the GTAG advice gives a likely indication as to what the U.K. Green Taxonomy may look like and how it might differ from the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy Regulation (\u201cEU Taxonomy\u201d). The GTAG report notes that the primary focus of the U.K. Green Taxonomy should be on investors and financial market participants and, as many U.K. financial market participants will also be subject to the EU Taxonomy, the U.K. should ensure close alignment with the EU Taxonomy so as to limit divergence and market fragmentation. If the GTAG advice is adopted, the U.K. Green Taxonomy should align with the EU Taxonomy except where doing so impact the simplicity or usability of the activity classification system or increases the risk of greenwashing.On December 14, 2022, the U.K. Government said it would delay secondary legislation under the taxonomy regulations (originally anticipated by the end of 2022).

The CBI regulates insurance and reinsurance companies and intermediaries authorized in Ireland. Our three Irish operating subsidiaries are Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Underwriters Europe Limited (\u201cArch Underwriters Europe\u201d). Arch Re Europe was licensed and authorized by the CBI as a non-life reinsurer in October 2008 and as a life reinsurer in November 2009. Arch Insurance (EU) was licensed and authorized by the CBI as a non-life insurer in December 2011. As part of our Brexit plan, Arch Insurance (EU) received approval from the CBI to expand the nature of its business in 2019 and commenced writing expanded insurance lines in the EEA in 2020 with the Part VII Transfer completed at the end of December 2020. Arch Underwriters Europe was registered by the CBI as an insurance and reinsurance intermediary in July 2014. Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Underwriters Europe are subject to the supervision of the CBI and must comply with Irish insurance acts and regulations as well as with directions and guidance issued by the CBI.Arch Re Europe and Arch Insurance (EU) are required to comply with Solvency II requirements. See \u201cEuropean Union \u2014Insurance and Reinsurance Regulatory Regime\u201d below for additional details. As an intermediary, Arch Underwriters Europe is subject to a different regulatory regime and is not subject to solvency capital rules but must comply with requirements such as to maintain professional indemnity insurance and to have directors that are fit and proper. Our Irish subsidiaries are also subject to the general body of Irish company laws and regulations including the provisions of the Companies Act 2014.Financial Resources. Arch Re Europe and Arch Insurance (EU) are required to meet economic risk-based solvency requirements imposed under Solvency II. Solvency II, together with European Commission \u201cdelegated acts\u201d and guidance issued by EIOPA sets out classification and eligibility requirements, including the features which capital must display in order to qualify as regulatory capital.Restrictions on Acquisitions. Under Irish law, the prior consent of the CBI is required before any person can acquire or increase a qualifying holding in an Irish insurer or reinsurer, including Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Re Europe, or their parent undertakings. A qualifying holding is defined for these purposes as a direct or indirect holding that represents 10% or more of the capital of, or voting rights, in the undertaking or makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of the undertaking.Restrictions on Payment of Dividends. Under Irish company law, Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Underwriters Europe are permitted to make distributions only out of profits available for distribution. A company\u2019s profits available for distribution are its accumulated, realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. Further, the CBI has powers to intervene if a dividend payment were to lead to a breach of regulatory capital requirements. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CBI issued guidance in April 2020, based on guidance issued by EIOPA, that insurance firms postpone any payment of dividend distributions or similar transactions until they can forecast their costs and future revenues with a greater degree of certainty. However, the CBI modified its guidance, with effect from October, 1 2021, so that the general restrictions on the payment of dividend distributions or variable remuneration are no longer in place. The CBI still requires (re)insurance firms to notify it in advance of any proposed distribution.European Union Considerations.

Solvency II took effect in full on January 1, 2016. Solvency II imposes economic risk-based solvency requirements across all EU Member States and consists of three pillars: Pillar I-quantitative capital requirements, based on a valuation of the entire balance sheet; Pillar II-qualitative regulatory review, which includes governance, internal controls, enterprise risk management and supervisory review process; and Pillar III-market discipline, which is accomplished through reporting of the insurer\u2019s financial condition to regulators and the public. Solvency II is supplemented by European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 (the \u201cDelegated Regulation\u201d), other European Commission \u201cdelegated acts\u201d and binding technical standards, and guidelines issued by EIOPA. The Delegated Regulation sets out more detailed requirements for individual insurance and reinsurance undertakings, as well as for groups, based on the overarching provisions of Solvency II, which together make up the core of the single prudential rulebook for insurance and reinsurance undertakings in the EU. In December 2020, EIOPA provided an opinion to the European Commission in relation to the review of the Solvency II regime. This review was initiated by the European Commission to determine if the Solvency II regime remains fit for purpose. In its opinion, EIOPA confirms that the overall Solvency II framework is working well from a prudential perspective, suggesting that there are no fundamental changes needed but that a number of amendments are required to ensure the regime continues as a well-functioning risk-based regime. In September 2021, the European Commission published legislative proposals for amendments to the Solvency II Directive arising out of EIOPA's review of the Solvency II regime. The proposed amendments cover a number of areas including proportionality, quality of supervision, sustainability risks and group and cross-border supervision. The European Parliament and the Council will consider the proposed amendments and it is anticipated that the amendments will be approved and in force by 2023 or 2024.In addition to the above Solvency II reform proposals, the European Commission continues to promote the development of the Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive (\u201cIRRD\u201d).

EIOPA has also indicated that, on a case by case basis, groups subject to this worldwide supervision may be exempted from any EEA sub-group supervision, where this results in more efficient supervision of the group and does not impair EEA supervisors in respect of their individual responsibilities.The Insurance Distribution Directive (\u201cIDD\u201d) was published in February 2016. EEA Member States were required to transpose the IDD by October 1, 2018. It replaces the existing Insurance Mediation Directive. The IDD applies to all distributors of insurance and reinsurance products (including insurers and reinsurers selling directly to customers) and strengthens the regulatory regime applicable to distribution activities through increased transparency, information and conduct requirements. The principal impact of the IDD is on the insurance market, however, requirements that apply across insurance and reinsurance include more specific conditions regarding knowledge and continuing professional development requirements for those involved in distribution of (re)insurance products. The IDD continues the existing ability for intermediaries established in a Member State of the EU to establish branches and provide services to all EEA states. Arch Underwriters Europe, being established in Ireland and authorized by the CBI, is able, subject to regulatory notifications and there being no objection from the CBI, to establish branches and provide services in all EEA states.Privacy. The European General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cEU GDPR\u201d) came into effect on May 25, 2018. The EU GDPR governs the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data, and its scope extends to certain entities not established in the EEA if they process personal data or offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, EEA data subjects. The EU GDPR contains a number of requirements regarding the processing of personal data about individuals, including mandatory security breach reporting, new and strengthened individual rights, evidenced data controller accountability for compliance with the GDPR principles (including fairness and transparency), maintenance of data processing activity records and the implementation of \u201cprivacy by design,\u201d including through the completion of mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessments in connection with higher risk data processing activities. In addition, the EU GDPR increases scrutiny of transfers of personal data to jurisdictions which the European Commission does not recognize as having \u201cadequate\u201d data protection laws. In particular, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU (Court of Justice) in Schrems II invalidated the European Union-United States (EU-U.S.) Privacy Shield on the grounds that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield failed to offer adequate protections to EU personal information transferred to the U.S. While the Court of Justice upheld the use of other data transfer mechanisms, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d), the decision has led to some uncertainty regarding the use of such mechanisms for data transfers to the U.S. and the Court of Justice made clear that reliance on SCCs alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. The European Data Protection Board issued additional guidance regarding international transfers which may require us to implement additional safeguards to further enhance the security of data transferred out of the EEA and the European Commission published new versions of the SCCs in June 2021, which place onerous obligations on the parties. On October 7, 2022, the U.S. President introduced an Executive Order to facilitate a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework which will act as a successor to the invalidated EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. If approved by the European Commission and implemented, the agreement will facilitate the transatlantic flow of personal data and provide additional safeguards to any existing data transfer mechanisms (including SCCs) for companies transferring personal data from the EU to the U.S. However, before entities rely on the new EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, there are still legislative and regulatory steps that must be undertaken both in the U.S. and in the EU. Therefore, at present SCCs are still the primary safeguard available for personal data transfers from the EU to the U.S.The EU GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches and violations (up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of global turnover). The EU GDPR allows data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the EU GDPR.Following the end of the Transition Period on December 31, 2020, GDPR was implemented in the U.K. (the \u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d) with similar fines for non-compliance. The requirements of the U.K. GDPR are virtually identical to those of the EU GDPR, including the prohibition on the transfer of personal data from the U.K. to other countries that are not recognized as having \u201cadequate\u201d data protection laws, including the U.S., in a similar manner to the EU. Transfers of personal data from the U.K. to the EEA are unrestricted and do not require additional safeguards. In June, 2021 the European Commission formally adopted an adequacy  contracts concluded by insurance undertakings in the EEA with reinsurers having their head office in a country whose solvency regime has been determined to be equivalent to Solvency II shall be treated in the same manner as reinsurance contracts with undertakings in the EEA authorized under Solvency II. From January 1, 2016, Bermuda was deemed by the European Commission to be equivalent for Solvency II purposes. Solvency II also includes specific measures providing for the supervision of insurance and reinsurance groups.

However, the European Commission retains the power to suspend, repeal or amend the adequacy decision if the U.K. deviates from the level of protection currently in place. In addition, the U.K. government has published its own form of SCCs, known as the International Data Transfer Agreement and International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU SCCs. The U.K. Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has also published its version of the transfer impact assessment and revised guidance on international transfers, although entities may choose to adopt either the EU or U.K. style transfer impact assessment. In terms of international data transfers between the U.K. and U.S., it is understood that the U.K. and the U.S. are negotiating an adequacy agreement.ESG Considerations. A comprehensive package of measures to facilitate the progression towards sustainable economic activities was approved in principle by the European Commission in April 2021. In August 2021, two delegated regulations (the \u201cEC Regulations\u201d) amending sectoral legislation, including the Solvency II Directive and the Insurance Distribution Directive, were published. The EC Regulations focus on the integration of sustainability into key activities including product oversight and governance, risk management and suitability assessment procedures. The EC Regulations apply from August 2022. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (\u201cCSRD\u201d), which replaces the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (\u201cNFRD\u201d), was published in the Official Journal of the EU in November 16, 2022 and enters into effect on January 5, 2023. Certain of our European subsidiaries are subject to NFRD. The CSRD expands the scope of sustainability reporting obligations to any European listed company or any company (including (re)insurers) meeting certain criteria. Companies which are already subject to NFRD must start reporting relevant information for financial years starting on or after January 1, 2024 beginning in 2025. Reporting obligations for other companies fulfilling certain criteria will commence in 2026 for financial years starting on or after January 1, 2025. In addition, the reporting standards under the CSRD, which provides in-scope companies with the technical detail on the information that will need to be disclosed and reported, are currently anticipated to be adopted by the European Commission by June 2023.An additional ESG framework, the EU Taxonomy, came into force in July 2020, with in-scope companies required to comply with certain reporting obligations from January 1, 2022. The EU Taxonomy (which is a classification standard for reporting) sets out six environmental objectives with which companies' economic activities must comply if they are to be described as environmentally sustainable. These six environmental objectives are: (1) climate change mitigation, (2) climate change adaptation, (3) sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, (4) transition to a circular economy, (5) pollution prevention and control and (6) the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. In addition, reporting obligations apply to in-scope companies regarding (1) the financial products they provide and (2) the environmental sustainability of an in-scope company's activities, which is to be disclosed in non-financial statements that are currently required under the NFRD (and subsequently under the CSRD once it is implemented). Certain of our European entities will fall within the scope of certain reporting obligations following the implementation of the CSRD.In February 2022, the European Commission adopted a proposal for the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (\u201cCSDD\u201d) and negotiation is ongoing. While the main focus of this proposal is on conducting due diligence on human rights and environmental impacts within a company and across its value chain, there are also additional sustainability requirements for certain in scope entities. As the CSDD is at an early proposal stage, its applicability to certain of our European entities is unclear, but we will monitor the development of the CSDD closely.In tandem with all of the above, EIOPA continues to engage with stakeholders in the (re)insurance sector and publish detailed guidelines, recommendations and expectations relating to ESG matters and how these should be managed and considered by the (re)insurance sector.Russian Sanctions. Since February 2022, the EU has imposed sanctions on the Russian Federation in response to the crisis in Ukraine. Given the evolving situation, we are closely monitoring developments and the sanctions imposed, to ensure our European entities remain in compliance with any sanctions measures imposed.Cyber Risk. Cyber risk and information security is an area of increasing focus for the EU. The Digital Operational Resilience Act (\u201cDORA\u201d) entered into force in January 2023. The core aim of DORA is to prevent and mitigate cyber threats and sets uniform requirements for the security of network and information systems of financial sector entities (including (re)insurers) as well as critical third parties which provide ICT (information and communication technology)-related services, such as cloud platforms or data analytics services. In scope entities will be required to comply with the obligations set out under DORA from January 2025.In addition to the above, EIOPA continues to publish detailed guidelines, recommendations and expectations relating to cyber matters and how these should be managed and considered by the (re)insurance sector. decision for the U.K., meaning data can flow freely from the EU to the U.K. This adequacy decision will remain in place for four years (until June 27, 2025) after which the adequacy decision may be renewed if the U.K. continues to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

Legislative, judicial or administrative changes or interpretations may be forthcoming that could be retroactive and could affect the tax consequences to us or to holders of our shares.Taxation of Arch CapitalBermuda. Under current Bermuda law, Arch Capital is not subject to tax on income or profits, withholding, capital gains or capital transfers. Arch Capital has obtained from the Minister of Finance under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda an assurance that, in the event that Bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits, income, any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance, the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to Arch Capital or to any of our operations or our shares, debentures or other obligations until March 31, 2035. Given the limited duration of the Minister of Finance's assurance, we could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after that date. This assurance will be subject to the proviso that it is not to be construed so as to prevent the application of any tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda (we are not so currently affected) or to prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the Land Tax Act 1967 of Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any property leased to us or our insurance subsidiary. We pay annual Bermuda government fees, and our Bermuda insurance and reinsurance subsidiary pays annual insurance license fees. In addition, all entities employing individuals in Bermuda are required to pay a payroll tax and other sundry taxes payable, directly or indirectly, to the Bermuda government.United States. Arch Capital and its non-U.S. subsidiaries believe they have conducted their operations and currently intend to conduct their operations going forward in a manner that has not caused them and will not cause them to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and, therefore, has not been and will not be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes (other than U.S. excise taxes on insurance and reinsurance premiums and withholding taxes on dividends and certain other U.S. source investment income). However, because definitive identification of activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. is not provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), U.S. Treasury regulations (\u201cTreasury Regulations\u201d) or court decisions, there can be no assurance that our position on being engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. is correct. A foreign corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as the branch profits tax, on its income, which is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under the permanent establishment provisions of a tax treaty. Such income tax, if imposed, would be based on effectively connected income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a domestic corporation, except that deductions and credits generally are not permitted unless the foreign corporation has timely filed a U.S. federal income tax return in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations. Penalties may be assessed for failure to file tax returns. In addition, in such case, a 30% branch profits tax would be imposed on net income after subtracting the regular corporate tax and making certain other adjustments.Under the income tax treaty between Bermuda and the U.S. (the \u201cTreaty\u201d), Arch Capital's Bermuda insurance subsidiaries will be subject to U.S. income tax on any insurance premium income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business only if that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the U.S. No Treasury Regulations interpreting the Treaty have been issued. While there can be no assurances, Arch Capital does not believe that any of its Bermuda insurance subsidiaries has a permanent establishment in the U.S. Such subsidiaries would not be entitled to the benefits of the Treaty if (i) 50% or less of Arch Capital's shares were beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by Bermuda residents or U.S. citizens or residents, or (ii) any such subsidiary's income were used in substantial part to make disproportionate distributions to, or to meet certain liabilities to, persons who are not Bermuda residents or U.S. citizens or residents. While Arch Capital believes that its Bermuda insurance subsidiaries have been eligible for Treaty benefits to date, there can be no assurance that this is the case or that the Bermuda insurance subsidiaries will continue to be eligible for Treaty benefits.The Treaty clearly applies to premium income but may be construed as not protecting investment income. If Arch Capital\u2019s Bermuda insurance subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business and were entitled to the benefits of the Treaty in general, but the Treaty were not found to protect investment income, a portion of such subsidiaries\u2019 investment income could be subject to U.S. federal income tax.Non-U.S. insurance companies carrying on an insurance business within the U.S. have a certain minimum amount of effectively connected net investment income, determined in accordance with a formula that depends, in part, on the amount of U.S. risk insured or reinsured by such companies.

Under the Tax Cuts Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a 10% U.S. Shareholder also includes any U.S. Person who is considered to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the value of our shares or those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries (as applicable). As a result, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the voting cut-back limitation contained in our bye-laws that limits the votes conferred by the Controlled Shares (as defined in our bye-laws) of any U.S. Person to 9.9% of the total voting power of all our shares entitled to vote will not prevent any U.S. holder from being treated as a 10% U.S. Shareholder. Due to the repeal of Section 958(b)(4) of the Code under the Tax Cuts Act, all non-U.S. subsidiaries directly or indirectly owned by Arch Capital are treated as constructively owned by its U.S. subsidiaries, and therefore are treated as CFCs.Status as a CFC would not cause us or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Such status also would have no adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for any U.S. holder that is not a 10% U.S. Shareholder with respect to us or any such non-U.S. subsidiary (as applicable). If we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are or were a CFC with respect to any taxable year, a U.S. holder that is considered a 10% U.S. Shareholder would be subject to current U.S. federal income taxation (at ordinary income tax rates) to the extent of all or a portion of the undistributed earnings and profits of Arch Capital and our subsidiaries attributable to \u201csubpart F income\u201d (including certain insurance premium income and investment income) or global intangible low-taxed income and may be taxable at ordinary income tax rates on any gain recognized on a sale or other disposition (including by way of repurchase or liquidation) of our common shares or preferred shares to the extent of the current and accumulated earnings and profits attributable to such common shares or preferred shares. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a helpful limitation, which provides that a U.S. shareholder would not be subject to the current inclusion rules of Subpart F for a taxable year unless the non-U.S. corporation was a CFC for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during such taxable year, will no longer apply.Related Person Insurance Income Rules. In general, with respect to RPII (a limited category of insurance income, as defined below), the CFC rules are expanded in two significant respects. First, in determining CFC status, as well as determining which U.S. shareholders are subject to current taxation with respect to a CFC\u2019s RPII (whether or not currently distributed), all U.S. shareholders (as opposed to only 10% U.S. Shareholders) are taken into account. Second, the amount of stock in a foreign corporation that all U.S. shareholders, in the aggregate, must own for such corporation to be treated as a CFC is reduced from more than 50% (by  preferred shares exceed our earnings and profits, they will be treated first as a return of the U.S. holder's basis in our common shares and our preferred shares to the extent thereof, and then as gain from the sale of a capital asset.United States\u2014Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition. Subject to the discussions below relating to the potential application of the CFC, RPII and PFIC rules, U.S holders of common shares and preferred shares generally will recognize capital gain or loss, if any, for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of common shares or preferred shares, as applicable.United States\u2014Redemption of Preferred Shares. A redemption of the preferred shares will be treated under Section 302 of the Code as a dividend to the extent we have earnings and profits allocable to such shares, unless the redemption satisfies one of the tests set forth in Section 302(b) of the Code enabling the redemption to be treated as a sale or exchange, subject to the discussion herein relating to the potential application of the CFC, RPII and PFIC rules. Under the relevant Code Section 302(b) tests, the redemption should be treated as a sale or exchange only if it (1) is substantially disproportionate, (2) constitutes a complete termination of the holder's stock interest in us or (3) is \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend.\u201d In determining whether any of these tests are met, shares considered to be owned by the holder by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the Code, as well as shares actually owned, must generally be taken into account. It may be more difficult for a U.S. holder who owns, actually or constructively by operation of the attribution rules, any of our other shares to satisfy any of the above requirements. The determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of Section 302(b) of the Code is satisfied with respect to a particular holder of the preferred shares depends on the facts and circumstances as of the time the determination is made.Taxation of Our U.S. ShareholdersControlled Foreign Corporation Rules. We or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries generally will be treated as a CFC with respect to any taxable year if at any time during such taxable year, one or more \u201c10% U.S. Shareholders\u201d (as defined below) collectively own more than 50% of us or such non-U.S. subsidiary (as applicable) by vote or value (taking into account shares actually owned by such U.S. holder as well as shares attributed to such U.S. holder under the Code or the Treasury Regulations thereunder). Moreover, with respect to insurance income (including reinsurance income), the \u201cmore than 50%\u201d requirement described in the preceding sentence is replaced with a more expansive \u201cmore than 25%\u201d requirement. For taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, a 10% U.S. Shareholder means any U.S. Person who was considered to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting  preferred shares exceed our earnings and profits, they will be treated first as a return of the U.S. holder's basis in our common shares and our preferred shares to the extent thereof, and then as gain from the sale of a capital asset. United States\u2014Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition. Subject to the discussions below relating to the potential application of the CFC, RPII and PFIC rules, U.S holders of common shares and preferred shares generally will recognize capital gain or loss, if any, for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of common shares or preferred shares, as applicable. United States\u2014Redemption of Preferred Shares. A redemption of the preferred shares will be treated under Section 302 of the Code as a dividend to the extent we have earnings and profits allocable to such shares, unless the redemption satisfies one of the tests set forth in Section 302(b) of the Code enabling the redemption to be treated as a sale or exchange, subject to the discussion herein relating to the potential application of the CFC, RPII and PFIC rules.

The determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of Section 302(b) of the Code is satisfied with respect to a particular holder of the preferred shares depends on the facts and circumstances as of the time the determination is made. Taxation of Our U.S. Shareholders Controlled Foreign Corporation Rules. We or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries generally will be treated as a CFC with respect to any taxable year if at any time during such taxable year, one or more \u201c10% U.S. Shareholders\u201d (as defined below) collectively own more than 50% of us or such non-U.S. subsidiary (as applicable) by vote or value (taking into account shares actually owned by such U.S. holder as well as shares attributed to such U.S. holder under the Code or the Treasury Regulations thereunder). Moreover, with respect to insurance income (including reinsurance income), the \u201cmore than 50%\u201d requirement described in the preceding sentence is replaced with a more expansive \u201cmore than 25%\u201d requirement. For taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, a 10% U.S. Shareholder means any U.S. Person who was considered to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting   power of our shares or those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries (as applicable). Under the Tax Cuts Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a 10% U.S. Shareholder also includes any U.S. Person who is considered to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the value of our shares or those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries (as applicable). As a result, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the voting cut-back limitation contained in our bye-laws that limits the votes conferred by the Controlled Shares (as defined in our bye-laws) of any U.S. Person to 9.9% of the total voting power of all our shares entitled to vote will not prevent any U.S. holder from being treated as a 10% U.S. Shareholder. Due to the repeal of Section 958(b)(4) of the Code under the Tax Cuts Act, all non-U.S. subsidiaries directly or indirectly owned by Arch Capital are treated as constructively owned by its U.S. subsidiaries, and therefore are treated as CFCs.Status as a CFC would not cause us or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Such status also would have no adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for any U.S. holder that is not a 10% U.S. Shareholder with respect to us or any such non-U.S. subsidiary (as applicable). If we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are or were a CFC with respect to any taxable year, a U.S. holder that is considered a 10% U.S. Shareholder would be subject to current U.S. federal income taxation (at ordinary income tax rates) to the extent of all or a portion of the undistributed earnings and profits of Arch Capital and our subsidiaries attributable to \u201csubpart F income\u201d (including certain insurance premium income and investment income) or global intangible low-taxed income and may be taxable at ordinary income tax rates on any gain recognized on a sale or other disposition (including by way of repurchase or liquidation) of our common shares or preferred shares to the extent of the current and accumulated earnings and profits attributable to such common shares or preferred shares.

Second, the amount of stock in a foreign corporation that all U.S. shareholders, in the aggregate, must own for such corporation to be treated as a CFC is reduced from more than 50% (by  power of our shares or those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries (as applicable). Under the Tax Cuts Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a 10% U.S. Shareholder also includes any U.S. Person who is considered to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the value of our shares or those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries (as applicable).

Second, the amount of stock in a foreign corporation that all U.S. shareholders, in the aggregate, must own for such corporation to be treated as a CFC is reduced from more than 50% (by  ARCH CAPITAL342022 FORM 10-K ARCH CAPITAL342022 FORM 10-K  ARCH CAPITAL342022 FORM 10-K 34 Table of Contents Table of Contents vote or value), and more than 25% (by vote or value) with respect to insurance income generally, to 25% or more (by vote or value). Generally, RPII is insurance income (including reinsurance income) of a foreign corporation with respect to which the insured is a United States shareholder of the foreign corporation or a related person to such a shareholder.Under one exception to the foregoing RPII rules, U.S. shareholders are not required to include a CFC\u2019s RPII currently in income if the CFC\u2019s gross RPII is less than 20% of its total gross insurance income for the taxable year in question (the \u201cRPII 20% gross income exception\u201d). Under current law, we currently expect each of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to satisfy the RPII 20% gross income exception, and therefore we currently do not expect any U.S. shareholder to be required to include RPII in income (although there can be no assurance that this is or will continue be the case). However, proposed Treasury Regulations issued on January 24, 2022, if finalized in their current form, would for the first time (on a prospective basis) expand the definition of RPII to include certain intercompany insurance income (including reinsurance income) in a manner that could cause certain of our foreign subsidiaries not to satisfy the RPII 20% gross income exception. In such event, (1) as noted above, all U.S. shareholders (not just 10% U.S. Shareholders) would be required to include RPII in income currently, whether or not distributed, and (2) as noted below, U.S. shareholders that are tax exempt entities would be required to treat such RPII inclusions as unrelated business taxable income. Current and prospective U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the potential impact of these proposed Treasury Regulations.Section 953(c)(7) of the Code generally provides that Section 1248 of the Code (which generally would require a U.S. holder to treat certain gains attributable to the sale, exchange or disposition of common shares or preferred shares as a dividend) will apply to the sale or exchange by a U.S. shareholder of shares in a foreign corporation that is characterized as a CFC under the RPII rules if the foreign corporation would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a U.S. corporation, regardless of whether the U.S. shareholder is a 10% U.S. Shareholder or whether the corporation qualifies for the RPII 20% gross income exception. Although existing Treasury Regulations do not address the question, proposed Treasury Regulations issued in April 1991 create some ambiguity as to whether Section 1248 and the requirement to file Form 5471 would apply when the non-U.S. corporation has a foreign insurance subsidiary that is a CFC for RPII purposes and that would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation. We believe that Section 1248 and the requirement to file Form 5471 will not apply to a less than 10% U.S. Shareholder because Arch Capital is not directly engaged in the insurance business. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will interpret the proposed Treasury Regulations in this manner or that the Treasury will not take the position that Section 1248 and the requirement to file Form 5471 will apply to dispositions of our common shares or our preferred shares.If the IRS or U.S. Treasury were to make Section 1248 of the Code and the Form 5471 filing requirement applicable to the sale of our shares, we would notify shareholders that Section 1248 of the Code and the requirement to file Form 5471 will apply to dispositions of our shares. Thereafter, we would send a notice after the end of each calendar year to all persons who were shareholders during the year notifying them that Section 1248 of the Code and the requirement to file Form 5471 apply to dispositions of our shares by U.S. holders. We would attach to this notice a copy of Form 5471 completed with all our information and instructions for completing the shareholder information.Tax-Exempt Shareholders. Tax-exempt entities may be required to treat certain Subpart F insurance income, including RPII, that is includible in income by the tax-exempt entity as unrelated business taxable income. Current and prospective U.S. holders that are tax exempt entities should consult their own tax advisors as to the potential impact of the unrelated business taxable income provisions of the Code.Passive Foreign Investment Companies. Sections 1291 through 1298 of the Code contain special rules applicable with respect to foreign corporations that are PFICs. In general, a foreign corporation will be a PFIC if 75% or more of its income constitutes \u201cpassive income\u201d or 50% or more of its assets produce passive income. If we were to be characterized as a PFIC, U.S. holders would be subject to a penalty tax at the time of their sale of (or receipt of an \u201cexcess distribution\u201d with respect to) their common shares or preferred shares imposed at the highest applicable rate under the Code for the applicable tax year. In general, a shareholder receives an \u201cexcess distribution\u201d if the amount of the distribution is more than 125% of the average distribution with respect to the shares during the three preceding taxable years (or shorter period during which the taxpayer held the stock). In general, the penalty tax is equivalent to an interest charge on taxes that are deemed due during the period the shareholder owned the shares, computed by assuming that the excess distribution or gain (in the case of a sale) with respect to the shares was taxable in equal portions throughout the holder\u2019s period of ownership. The interest charge is equal to the applicable rate imposed on underpayments of U.S. federal income tax for such period. A U.S. shareholder may avoid some of the adverse tax consequences of owning shares in a PFIC by making a qualified electing fund (\u201cQEF\u201d) election. A QEF election is revocable only with the consent of the IRS and has the following consequences to a shareholder: vote or value), and more than 25% (by vote or value) with respect to insurance income generally, to 25% or more (by vote or value). Generally, RPII is insurance income (including reinsurance income) of a foreign corporation with respect to which the insured is a United States shareholder of the foreign corporation or a related person to such a shareholder.Under one exception to the foregoing RPII rules, U.S. shareholders are not required to include a CFC\u2019s RPII currently in income if the CFC\u2019s gross RPII is less than 20% of its total gross insurance income for the taxable year in question (the \u201cRPII 20% gross income exception\u201d).

A QEF election is revocable only with the consent of the IRS and has the following consequences to a shareholder: ARCH CAPITAL352022 FORM 10-K ARCH CAPITAL352022 FORM 10-K  ARCH CAPITAL352022 FORM 10-K 35 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022For any year in which Arch Capital is not a PFIC, no income tax consequences would result. \u2022For any year in which Arch Capital is a PFIC, the shareholder would include in its taxable income a proportionate share of the net ordinary income and net capital gains of Arch Capital and certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries.For taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, the determination of whether the active insurance company exception applies to an insurance company was made on a case-by-case basis and the analysis was inherently subjective. Under the Tax Cuts Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the active insurance company exception applies only if (i) the company would be taxed as an insurance company were it a U.S. corporation and (ii) either (A) loss and loss adjustment expense and certain reserves constitute more than 25% of the company\u2019s gross assets for the relevant year or (B) loss and loss adjustment expenses and certain reserves constitute more than 10% of the company\u2019s gross assets for the relevant year and, based on the applicable facts and circumstances, the company is predominantly engaged in an insurance business and the failure of the company to satisfy the preceding 25% test is due solely to run-off related or other specified circumstances involving the insurance business. The PFIC statutory provisions contain a look-through rule that states that, for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a PFIC, such foreign corporation shall be treated as if it \u201creceived directly its proportionate share of the income\u201d and as if it \u201cheld its proportionate share of the assets\u201d of any other corporation in which it owns at least 25% of the stock. We believe that we were not a PFIC for any taxable year ended on or before December 31, 2022 and we currently are not expecting to become a PFIC for any subsequent taxable year. However, due to the complexity and uncertainty of the PFIC rules and the limited guidance interpreting them, there can be no assurance that we have not been a PFIC to date or that we will not become a PFIC at some time in the future.On December 4, 2020, the IRS issued certain final Treasury Regulations (the \u201c2020 final PFIC insurance regulations\u201d) and revised proposed Treasury Regulations (the \u201c2020 proposed PFIC insurance regulations\u201d) regarding the application of the insurance company exception. While we believe that the 2020 final PFIC insurance regulations and the 2020 proposed PFIC insurance regulations should not adversely impact the our ability to satisfy the insurance company exception and avoid being treated as a PFIC, there can be no assurance that such exception will in fact apply and/or will continue to apply at all times in the future. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor as to the effects of these rules.United States Taxation of Non-U.S. ShareholdersTaxation of Dividends. Cash distributions, if any, made with respect to common shares or preferred shares held by a holder that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. holder (a \u201cNon-U.S. holder\u201d) generally will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax.Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition. Non-U.S. holders of common shares or preferred shares generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to gain recognized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of such shares unless such gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. holder or such person is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year the gain is recognized and certain other requirements are satisfied.Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. Non-U.S. holders of common shares or preferred shares will not be subject to U.S. information reporting or backup withholding with respect to dispositions of common shares effected through a non-U.S. office of a broker, unless the broker has certain connections to the U.S. or is a U.S. person. No U.S. backup withholding will apply to payments of dividends, if any, on our common shares or our preferred shares.FATCA Withholding. Sections 1471 through 1474 to the Code, known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (\u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a withholding tax of 30% on U.S.-source interest, dividends and certain other types of income, which is received by a foreign financial institution (\u201cFFI\u201d), unless such FFI enters into an agreement with the IRS to obtain certain information as to the identity of the direct and indirect owners of accounts in such institution.\u00a0In addition, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on the above payments to certain non-financial foreign entities which do not (i) certify to each applicable withholding agent that they have no \u201csubstantial U.S. owners\u201d (i.e., a U.S. 10% direct or indirect shareholder), or (ii) provide such withholding agent with the certain information as to the identity of such substantial U.S. owners. The U.S. has entered into intergovernmental agreements to implement FATCA (\u201cIGAs\u201d) with a number of jurisdictions. Bermuda has signed an IGA with the U.S. Different rules than those described above may apply under such an IGA.Although dividends with respect to our common shares or preferred shares generally will be treated as foreign source for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes, it is unclear whether, for FATCA purposes, some or all of our dividends may be recharacterized as U.S. source dividends.
