Business   Introduction  We are an international producer and marketer of beer, wine, and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy with powerful, consumer-connected, high-quality brands like Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, the Robert Mondavi Brand Family, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner Wine Company, High West, Casa Noble, and Mi CAMPO. In the U.S., we are one of the top growth contributors at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. We are the third-largest beer company in the U.S. and continue to strengthen our leadership position as the #1 high-end beer supplier and the #1 share gainer across the U.S. beer market. Within wine and spirits, we are making solid progress in refining our brand portfolio to shift to a higher-end focused business to deliver net sales growth and margin expansion. The strength of our brands makes us a supplier of choice to many of our consumers and our customers, which include wholesale distributors, retailers, and on-premise locations. We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.  Our mission is to build brands that people love because we believe elevating human connections is Worth Reaching For. It is worth our dedication, hard work, and calculated risks to anticipate market trends and deliver more for our consumers, shareholders, employees, and industry. This dedication is what has driven us to become one of the fastest-growing, large CPG companies in the U.S. at retail. Our core values guide our pursuits:  People \u2013 True strength is achieved when everyone has a voice. That is why we build our culture on a foundation that encourages inclusion and diversity in background and thought and aspire to foster an environment where everyone feels empowered to bring their true selves and different points of view to drive us forward Customers \u2013 We relentlessly work to anticipate what consumers want today, tomorrow, and well into the future Entrepreneurship \u2013 As an industry leader, we act with a bold, calculated approach to realize our vision and unlock new growth opportunities Quality \u2013 Our promise is to pursue quality in our processes and products by continuously seeking to enhance what we do and how we do it Integrity \u2013 It is about more than achieving goals. How we achieve them is also important. We aspire to act with high moral and ethical standards and always do the right thing, even when it is the hard thing  Headquartered in Victor, New York, we are a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945.  Strategy  Our overall strategic vision is to consistently deliver industry-leading total stockholder returns over the long-term through a focus on these key pillars:  \u2022continue building strong brands people love with advantaged routes to market; \u2022build a culture that is consumer-obsessed and leverages robust innovation capabilities to stay on the forefront of consumer trends; \u2022deploy capital in line with disciplined and balanced priorities; and \u2022deliver on impactful ESG initiatives that we believe are not only good business, but also good for the world.  We will continue to strive for success by ensuring consumer-led decision making drives all aspects of our business; building a diverse talent pipeline with best-in-class people development; investing in infrastructure that supports and enables our business, including data systems and architecture; and exemplifying intentional and proactive fiscal management. We place focus on positioning our portfolio on higher-margin, higher-growth categories of the beverage alcohol industry to align with consumer-led premiumization trends, which we believe will continue to drive faster growth rates across beer, wine, and spirits. To continue capitalizing on consumer-led premiumization trends, become more competitive, and grow our business, we have employed a strategy  Constellation Brands, Inc.

BUSINESSTable of Contents Table of Contents dedicated to organic growth and supplemented by targeted investments and acquisitions. We also believe a key component to driving faster growth rates is to invest and strengthen our leadership position within the DTC and 3-tier eCommerce channels. We have launched a multi-year Digital Business Acceleration initiative, which we believe will enable us to drive results by enhancing our technology capabilities in key areas. In Fiscal 2023, we focused on procurement, end-to-end supply chain planning, and marketing optimization. We believe our continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet provides a solid financial foundation to support our broader strategic initiatives. As a result of this strategy, we have realized impacts on each segment of our business.  In our beer business, we focus on strengthening our leadership position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market and continuing to grow our brands through maintenance of leading margins, enhancements to our results of operations and operating cash flow, and exploring new avenues for growth. This includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the U.S. through expanding distribution for key brands, including within the 3-tier eCommerce channel, as well as investing in the next increment of capacity additions required to sustain our momentum. We continue to focus on consumer-led innovation by creating new line extensions behind celebrated, trusted brands and package formats that are intended to meet emerging needs.  In our wine and spirits business, we continue to focus on higher-end brands, improving margins, and creating operating efficiencies. We continue to refine our portfolio primarily through an enhanced focus on higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. Our business is organized into two distinct commercial teams, one focused on our fine wine and craft spirits brands and the other focused on our mainstream and premium brands. While each team has its own distinct strategy, both remain aligned to the goal of accelerating performance by growing organic net sales and expanding margins. In addition, we are advancing our aim to become a global, omni-channel competitor in line with consumer preferences. Our business continues to progressively expand into DTC channels (including hospitality), 3-tier eCommerce, and international markets, while continuing to grow in U.S. 3-tier brick-and-mortar distribution.  We complement our strategy with our investment in Canopy by expanding our portfolio into adjacent categories. Canopy is a leading cannabis and CPG company with operations in Canada, the U.S., Germany, and certain other global markets. This investment is consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, address, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics. Our strategic relationship with Canopy is designed to help position it to be successful in cannabis production, branding, and intellectual property. We expect this relationship to continue through the completion of the Canopy Transaction including the conversion of our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares. For further information on our plan to convert our Canopy common stock ownership, see \u201cCanopy segment\u201d below.  For further information on our strategy, see \u201cOverview\u201d within MD&A.

The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. Our ownership interest in Canopy allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, and, therefore, we account for our investment in Canopy under the equity method.

In the past 10 years we have increased our production capacity in Mexico by fourfold allowing us the opportunity to further expand our leadership position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. Since the 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, we have invested approximately $6.4\u00a0billion in the Mexico Beer Projects, with over $750\u00a0million spent during Fiscal\u00a02023. During Fiscal 2023, our brewery optimization and productivity initiatives unlocked incremental capacity from our existing footprint, increasing total capacity from approximately 39\u00a0million hectoliters to approximately 42 million hectoliters. We expect to spend an additional $4.0\u00a0billion to $4.5\u00a0billion over Fiscal 2024 through Fiscal 2026. Expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities continue at our breweries in Mexico to support expected future business needs.

We are also building on the success of our leading import brand families through our innovation strategy. Our Modelo Chelada brands have become an important growth contributor to our portfolio as the leading chelada in the U.S. beer market. In Fiscal 2023, we continued to build on this successful innovation platform with the launch of a (i)\u00a0multipack of Modelo Chelada Lim\u00f3n y Sal, (ii)\u00a0Modelo Chelada variety pack, (iii)\u00a0new Modelo Chelada flavor, Naranja Picosa, and (iv) Vicky Chamoy, Victoria\u2019s first line extension.

Marketing and distribution  To focus on their respective product categories, build brand equity, and increase sales, we employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales, and customer service functions for our Beer and Wine and Spirits segments. These functions engage in a range of marketing activities and strategies, including market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, on-premise activations, and public relations.  When we advertise our products to consumers, we use a combination of methods to forecast the number of advertising impressions made on individuals at or above the legal drinking age. Through our media placement agencies, we leverage recognized audience measurement services such as Nielsen and ComScore to measure audience composition data on a regular and frequent basis. This data helps us to ensure that our advertising placements are purchased in media outlets and audience buying platforms (i.e., programmatic digital buys) that are primarily targeted toward legal drinking age consumers and, when appropriate, specifically targeted to audiences that are age-verified as of the legal drinking age. Our Global Code of Responsible Practices for Beverage Alcohol Advertising and Marketing provides the fundamental framework for responsible brand advertising and marketing that helps ensure our messages are directed at legal drinking age consumers.

In collaboration with Responsibility.org we updated our brand websites to redirect a visitor who self-identifies as being under the legal drinking age to Responsibility.org for information on prevention of underage drinking, ending drunk driving, and drinking responsibly.  In Fiscal 2023, we had zero: \u2022instances of non-compliance with industry or regulatory labeling and/or marketing codes; and \u2022monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with marketing and/or labeling practice.  In the U.S., our products are primarily distributed by wholesale distributors, which generally have separate distribution networks for (i)\u00a0our beer portfolio and (ii)\u00a0our wine and spirits portfolio. In addition, in states where the government acts as the distributor, we distribute our products through state alcohol beverage control agencies, which set the retail prices of our products. As is the case with all other beverage alcohol companies, products sold through these agencies are subject to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell our products in that agency\u2019s state. State governments can also affect prices paid by consumers for our products through the imposition of taxes.  Trademarks and distribution agreements  Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license. We also have various licenses and distribution agreements for the sale, or the production and sale, of our products, and products of others. These licenses and distribution agreements have varying terms and durations.  Within the Beer segment, we have an exclusive sub-license to use trademarks related to our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. This sub-license agreement is perpetual.  Competition  The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and reputation, and distribution strength. Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence, and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do.

In the adult-use market, Canopy competes on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition, consistency, and variety of cannabis products whereas these same competitive factors apply in the medicinal market as well as physician familiarity.  Production  As of February\u00a028, 2023, our production capacity at our Mexican breweries was approximately 42 million hectoliters. By the end of Fiscal 2026, we expect to increase our capacity in Mexico to approximately 67 to 72\u00a0million hectoliters to support the growth of our Mexican beer brands.

In March\u00a02023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Daleville Facility. For further information on this transaction, refer to (i)\u00a0\u201cOverview\u201d within MD&A and (ii)\u00a0Note 5.  In the U.S., we operate 12 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma, Monterey, and San Joaquin regions of California as well as the Willamette Valley region of Oregon. We also operate two wineries in New Zealand and five wineries in Italy. Grapes are normally crushed in August through November in the U.S. and Italy, and in February through May in New\u00a0Zealand and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk. The inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each year\u2019s grape harvest and are reduced as sold throughout the year.  We currently operate five distilleries in the U.S. for the production of our spirits: two facilities for High West whiskey and one facility each for Copper & Kings American brandies, Nelson\u2019s Green Brier bourbon and whiskey products, and Austin Cocktails RTDs. The requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of our spirits are purchased from various suppliers.  Certain of our wines and spirits must be aged for multiple years. Therefore, our inventories of wines and spirits may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businesses.  Resources and availability of production materials  The principal components in the production of our Mexican and craft beer brands include water; agricultural products, such as yeast and grains; and packaging materials, which include glass, aluminum, and cardboard.For our Mexican beer brands, packaging materials are the largest cost component of production, with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials.For Fiscal 2023, the package format mix of our Mexican beer volume sold in the U.S. was as follows: The principal components in the production of our Mexican and craft beer brands include water; agricultural products, such as yeast and grains; and packaging materials, which include glass, aluminum, and cardboard.For our Mexican beer brands, packaging materials are the largest cost component of production, with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials.

We also have long-term glass supply agreements with other glass producers.  The current Mexican breweries each receive water originating from separate and distinct aquifers. We believe we have adequate access to water to support these breweries\u2019 ongoing requirements, as well as future requirements after the completion of planned expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities. These breweries employ comprehensive water management practices that focus on water efficiency and wastewater treatment operations to reuse water consumed as part of the production process.  The principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain, and packaging materials, primarily glass.  Most of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by grower purchases from each year\u2019s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through November in the U.S. and Italy and begins in February and runs through May in New Zealand. We receive grapes from approximately 590 independent growers located in the U.S. and 50\u00a0independent growers in New Zealand and Italy. We enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies year-to-year and is largely based on then-current market prices.  Constellation Brands, Inc.

BUSINESSTable of Contents Table of Contents As of February\u00a028, 2023, we owned or leased approximately 18,200 acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under development, in the U.S., New Zealand, and Italy. This acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production. However, most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higher-end wines. We continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings, to supplement our grape supply.  All of our owned and leased vineyards in California (U.S.) routinely adhere to documented water management plans as required by Sustainable Grape Growing Certifications including the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance and Fish Friendly Farming. We use the guidance of these plans to identify the designated beneficial use of the water body based on grape growing goals set before the growing season that account for soil types, slopes, irrigation water availability and quality, and energy efficiency.  We believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations. However, when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the world.  The distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits, and bulk spirits, which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market. We believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time.  We utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate bottles and other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels, and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products. After grape purchases, glass bottles are the largest component of our cost of product sold. In the U.S., the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers. We have traditionally obtained, and continue to obtain, our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under long-term supply arrangements. Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations. We have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this time.  Government regulations  We are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Where we produce products, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and may be required to obtain environmental and alcohol beverage permits and licenses to operate our facilities. Where we market and sell products, we may be subject to laws and regulations on brand registration, packaging and labeling, distribution methods and relationships, pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising, and public relations. The countries in which we operate impose duties, excise taxes, and other taxes on beverage alcohol products, and on certain raw materials used to produce our beverage alcohol products, in varying amounts. We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership, or control.  We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We also believe that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows.  Seasonality  The beverage alcohol industry is subject to seasonality in each major category. As a result, in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases, our beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, which correspond to the Spring and Summer periods in the U.S. Our wine and spirits sales are typically highest during the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying.

Critical local projects have been identified through community collaboration and input and guidance from third-party water restoration organizations. For example, and as outlined above, as part of our efforts to improve access to water, the Nava Brewery coordinated with the Coahuila state government to improve both the water infrastructure and availability in the city of Zaragoza, a neighboring community near the Nava Brewery. This two-phase project was completed in Fiscal\u00a02023 and improves accessibility to quality water for local residents. In Obregon, we have worked with local organizations to construct three dams along the Yaqui Valley irrigation canal that help improve water management efficiency, recovering volumes of water year over year. These efforts continue to play a vital role in the sustainability of the region. This is in addition to other benefits we provide, including local job creation and fueling economic development. We are currently working with local authorities in areas near the Veracruz Brewery to identify and implement similar initiatives.
