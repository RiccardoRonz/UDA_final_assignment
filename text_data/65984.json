{"cik": 65984, "item_1A": "Item 1.  Business  RISK FACTORS SUMMARY  Entergy\u2019s business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could affect its ability to successfully implement its business strategy and affect its financial results.  Carefully consider all of the information in this report and, in particular, the following principal risks and all of the other specific factors described in Item 1A. of this report, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d before deciding whether to invest in Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries.  Utility Regulatory Risks  \u2022The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal, potentially resulting in lengthy litigation, and uncertainty as to ultimate results. \u2022Entergy\u2019s business could experience adverse effects related to changes to state or federal legislation or regulation. \u2022The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. \u2022The Utility operating companies are subject to risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. \u2022The continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures taken are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. \u2022A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and its Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. \u2022Weather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors may have a material impact on electricity and gas usage and otherwise materially affect the Utility operating companies\u2019 results of operations.  Nuclear Operating, Shutdown, and Regulatory Risks  \u2022The results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy could be materially affected by the following: \u25e6inability to consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors; \u25e6refueling outages that last materially longer than anticipated or unplanned outages; \u25e6risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication); \u25e6the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants; \u25e6risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants; \u25e6the costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants; \u25e6the potential requirement to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act and/or by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance; \u25e6the risk that the decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts; and \u25e6new or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel.  General Business Risks  \u2022Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies.\u202f\u202fDisruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 246 246 246 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \u2022A downgrade in Entergy\u2019s or its Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 credit ratings could, among other things, negatively affect Entergy\u2019s and its Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 ability to access capital and the cost of such capital. \u2022Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity or the inability to meet their stated goals or commitments, among other potential causes. \u2022Changes in tax legislation and taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy\u2019s and the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \u2022Entergy and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to successfully execute on their business strategies, including their ability to complete capital projects, other capital improvements, and strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, and, as a result, they may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated results of such strategies. \u2022Failure to attract, retain, and manage an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively affect Entergy or its subsidiaries\u2019 results of operations. \u2022Entergy and Entergy\u2019s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, may incur substantial costs (i) to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters or (ii) related to reliability standards. \u2022Entergy could be negatively affected by the effects of climate change, including physical risks, such as increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes and other severe weather, and transition risks, such as environmental and regulatory obligations intended to combat the effects of climate change, including by compelling greenhouse gas emission reductions or reporting, or increasing clean or renewable energy requirements, or placing a price on greenhouse gas emissions. \u2022Entergy and its subsidiaries are dependent on the continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses. \u2022Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices. \u2022The Utility operating companies and Entergy\u2019s non-regulated operations are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations. \u2022Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. \u2022The litigation environment in the states in which the Registrant Subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. \u2022Terrorist attacks, physical attacks, cyber attacks, system failures, or data breaches of Entergy\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 or their suppliers\u2019 physical infrastructure or technology systems may adversely affect Entergy\u2019s results of operations. \u2022Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs. \u2022Significant increases in commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses may adversely affect Entergy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \u2022The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans\u2019s results of operations and liquidity. \u2022System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on sales to affiliated companies for all of its revenues.  Certain contractual arrangements relating to System Energy, the affiliated companies, and these revenues are the subject of ongoing litigation and regulatory proceedings.  The aggregate amount of refunds claimed in these proceedings substantially exceeds the current net book value of System Energy.  In the event of an adverse decision in one or more of these proceedings requiring the payment of substantial additional refunds, System Energy would be required to seek financing to pay such refunds, which financing may not be available on terms acceptable to System Energy, or may not be available at all, when required.  If one or more of the foregoing events occurs, System Energy may be required to explore other options or protections available to it to extend, restructure, or retire its indebtedness and to prioritize its obligations. \u2022Entergy\u2019s non-regulated operations are subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory, or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. \u2022As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock, and has provided, and may continue to provide, capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries, which would reduce the funds available to meet its other financial obligations. 247 247 247  Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  ENTERGY\u2019S BUSINESS  Entergy is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 24,000 MW of electric generating capacity, including approximately 5,000 MW of nuclear power.  Entergy delivers electricity to 3 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy had annual revenues of $13.8 billion in 2022 and had approximately 12,000 employees as of December\u00a031, 2022.  Entergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.  \u2022The Utility business segment includes the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operation of a small natural gas distribution business. \u2022The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment includes the ownership, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating plants to wholesale customers.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides services to other nuclear power plant owners and owns interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers.  See \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business\u201d for discussion of the shutdown and sale of each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants.  With the sale of Palisades in June 2022, Entergy completed its multi-year strategy to exit the merchant nuclear power business.  Upon completion of all transition activities, effective January 1, 2023, Entergy Wholesale Commodities is no longer a reportable business segment.  See Note 13 to the financial statements for financial information regarding Entergy\u2019s business segments.  Strategy  Entergy\u2019s strategy is to operate and grow its utility business, creating sustainable value for its customers, employees, communities, and owners.  Entergy\u2019s strategy to achieve its stakeholder objectives has a few key aspects.  First, Entergy invests in the Utility for the benefit of its customers, which supports steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends.  Second, Entergy manages risks by ensuring its Utility investments are customer-centric, supported by progressive regulatory constructs, and executed with disciplined project management.  Third, Entergy is committed to delivering sustainable outcomes for all of its stakeholders by focusing on continually improving key elements of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), including reducing carbon emissions and improving resilience for Entergy and its customers.\u00a0 Entergy also executed the wind down of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant nuclear generation business, which was effectively complete by the end of 2022.   Utility  The Utility business segment includes five retail electric utility subsidiaries: Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas.\u00a0\u00a0These companies generate, transmit, distribute, and sell electric power to retail and wholesale customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans also provide natural gas utility services to customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0Also included in the Utility is System Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation that owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf.\u00a0\u00a0System Energy sells its power and capacity from Grand Gulf at wholesale to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.\u00a0\u00a0The five retail utility subsidiaries are each regulated by the FERC and by state utility commissions, or, in the case of Entergy New Orleans, the City Council.\u00a0\u00a0System Energy is regulated by the FERC because all of its transactions are at wholesale.\u00a0\u00a0The Utility has a diverse power generation portfolio, including increasingly carbon-free energy sources, which is consistent with Entergy\u2019s strong support for the environment. 248 248 248 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy   Customers  As of December\u00a031, 2022, the Utility operating companies provided retail electric and gas service to customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, as follows: \u00a0\u00a0Electric CustomersGas Customers\u00a0Area Served(In Thousands)(%)(In Thousands)(%)Entergy ArkansasPortions of Arkansas730\u00a024\u00a0%\u00a0\u00a0Entergy LouisianaPortions of Louisiana1,101\u00a037\u00a0%95\u00a047\u00a0%Entergy MississippiPortions of Mississippi461\u00a015\u00a0%\u00a0\u00a0Entergy New OrleansCity of New Orleans 211\u00a07\u00a0%109\u00a053\u00a0%Entergy TexasPortions of Texas499\u00a017\u00a0%\u00a0\u00a0Total customers\u00a03,002\u00a0100\u00a0%204\u00a0100\u00a0%  Electric and Natural Gas Energy Sales  Electric Energy Sales  The total electric energy sales of the Utility operating companies are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with the peak sales period normally occurring during the third quarter of each year.\u00a0\u00a0On June 24, 2022, Entergy reached a 2022 peak demand of 22,301 MWh, compared to the 2021 peak of 22,051 MWh recorded on August 23, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0Selected electric energy sales data for 2022 is shown in the table below: \u00a0Entergy ArkansasEntergy LouisianaEntergy MississippiEntergy New OrleansEntergy TexasSystem EnergyEntergy (a)\u00a0(GWh)Sales to retail customers22,473\u00a057,532\u00a013,038\u00a05,706\u00a021,380\u00a0\u2014\u00a0120,129\u00a0Sales for resale:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Affiliates1,906\u00a05,416\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0279\u00a07,739\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Others6,520\u00a03,423\u00a02,914\u00a02,298\u00a0813\u00a0\u2014\u00a015,968\u00a0Total30,899\u00a066,371\u00a015,952\u00a08,004\u00a022,472\u00a07,739\u00a0136,097\u00a0Average use per residential customer (kWh)13,478\u00a014,874\u00a014,791\u00a012,818\u00a015,444\u00a0\u2014\u00a014,479\u00a0  (a)Includes the effect of intercompany eliminations.

See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of ongoing proceedings at the FERC challenging System Energy\u2019s authorized return on common equity and capital structure.  Entergy Arkansas  Formula Rate Plan  Between base rate cases, Entergy Arkansas is able to adjust base rates annually, subject to certain caps, through formula rate plans that utilize a forward test year.  Entergy Arkansas is subject to a maximum rate change  251 251 251 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  of 4% of the filing year total retail revenue.  In addition, Entergy Arkansas is subject to a true-up of projection to actuals netted with future projection.  In response to Entergy Arkansas\u2019s application for a general change in rates in 2015, the APSC approved the formula rate plan tariff proposed by Entergy Arkansas including its use of a projected year test period and an initial five-year term.  The initial five-year term expired in 2021.  As granted by Arkansas law, Entergy Arkansas obtained APSC approval of the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five-year term, through 2026.  If Entergy Arkansas\u2019s formula rate plan were terminated, Entergy Arkansas could file an application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism.  Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery  Entergy Arkansas\u2019s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased power costs in monthly bills.\u00a0\u00a0The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar year.\u00a0\u00a0The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.\u00a0\u00a0In December 2007 the APSC issued an order stating that Entergy Arkansas\u2019s energy cost recovery rider will remain in effect, and any future termination of the rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and hearing.  Production Cost Allocation Rider  Entergy Arkansas has in place an APSC-approved production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of System Agreement proceedings.  Entergy Louisiana  Formula Rate Plan  Entergy Louisiana historically sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using a historic test year.  The form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the LPSC in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in February 2013.  The formula rate plan was most recently extended through the test year 2022; certain modifications were made in that extension, including a decrease to the allowed return on equity, narrowing of the earnings \u201cdead band\u201d around the mid-point allowed return on equity, elimination of sharing above and below the earnings \u201cdead band,\u201d and the addition of a distribution cost recovery mechanism.  The formula rate plan continues to include exceptions from the rate cap and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities and purchase power agreements approved by the LPSC, certain transmission investments, and most recently, certain distribution investments, among other items.  In the event that the electric formula rate plan is not renewed or extended or otherwise replaced, Entergy Louisiana would revert to the more traditional rate case environment with a rate case filing occurring as soon as mid-2023.  Fuel Recovery  Entergy Louisiana\u2019s rate schedules include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power costs.\u00a0\u00a0The fuel adjustment clause contains a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings related to audits of Entergy Louisiana\u2019s fuel adjustment clause filings. 252 252 252 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy   To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Louisiana historically hedged approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year.\u00a0\u00a0The hedge quantity was reviewed on an annual basis.  In January 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC to suspend these seasonal hedging programs and implement financial hedges with terms up to five years for a portion of its natural gas exposure, which was approved in November 2018.  Entergy Louisiana\u2019s gas rates include a purchased gas adjustment clause based on estimated gas costs for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.  Retail Rates - Gas  In accordance with the settlement of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana\u2019s gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2012, in August 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted for consideration a proposal for implementation of an infrastructure rider to recover expenditures associated with strategic plant investment and relocation projects mandated by local governments.  After review by the LPSC staff and inclusion of certain customer safeguards required by the LPSC staff, in December 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint settlement for implementation of an accelerated gas pipe replacement program providing for the replacement of approximately 100 miles of pipe over the next ten years, as well as relocation of certain existing pipe resulting from local government-related infrastructure projects, and for a rider to recover the investment associated with these projects.  The rider allows for recovery of approximately $65 million over ten years.  The rider recovery will be adjusted on a quarterly basis to include actual investment incurred for the prior quarter and is subject to the following conditions, among others:  a ten-year term; application of any earnings in excess of the upper end of the earnings band as an offset to the revenue requirement of the infrastructure rider; adherence to a specified spending plan, within plus or minus 20% annually; annual filings comparing actual versus planned rider spending with actual spending and explanation of variances exceeding 10%; and an annual true-up.  The joint settlement was approved by the LPSC in January 2015.  Implementation of the infrastructure rider commenced with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of April 2015.  In April 2022 Entergy Louisiana submitted for consideration a proposal to extend the infrastructure rider to address replacement of an additional 187 miles of pipe.  In December 2022 Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted an uncontested settlement that extends the rider for an additional ten years beginning after the end of the current term of the rider in 2025.  The extension is subject to the same customer safeguards and conditions as the original term of the rider.  The extension allows for recovery of approximately $95 million over ten years.  In February 2023, the uncontested settlement was approved by the LPSC.  Storm Cost Recovery  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Louisiana\u2019s filings to recover storm-related costs.  Other  In March 2016 the LPSC opened two dockets to examine, on a generic basis, issues that it identified in connection with its review of Cleco Corporation\u2019s acquisition by third party investors.\u00a0 The first docket is captioned \u201cIn re: Investigation of double leveraging issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities,\u201d and the second is captioned \u201cIn re: Investigation of tax structure issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities.\u201d\u00a0 In April 2016 the LPSC clarified that the concerns giving rise to the two dockets arose as a result of its review of the structure of the Cleco-Macquarie transaction and that the specific intent of the directives is to seek more information regarding intra-corporate debt financing of a utility\u2019s capital structure as well as the use of investment tax credits to mitigate the tax  253 253 253 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  obligation at the parent level of a consolidated entity.\u00a0 No schedule has been set for either docket, and limited discovery has occurred.  In December 2019 an LPSC commissioner issued an unopposed directive to staff to research customer-centered options for all customer classes, as well as other regulatory environments, and recommend a plan for how to ensure customers are the focus.  There was no opposition to the directive from other commissioners but several remarked that the intent of the directive was not initiated to pursue retail open access.  In furtherance of the directive, the LPSC issued a notice of the opening of a docket to conduct a rulemaking to research and evaluate customer-centered options for all electric customer classes as well as other regulatory environments in January 2020.  To date, the LPSC staff has requested multiple rounds of comments from stakeholders and conducted one technical conference.  Topics on which comments have been filed include full and limited retail access, demand response, sleeved power purchase agreements, and energy efficiency.  Neither the LPSC or the LPSC staff have made recommendations or adopted any rules.  Entergy Mississippi  Formula Rate Plan  Since the conclusion in 2015 of Entergy Mississippi\u2019s most recent base rate case, Entergy Mississippi has set electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan.  Between base rate cases, Entergy Mississippi is able to adjust base rates annually, subject to certain caps, through formula rate plans that utilize forward-looking features.  In addition, Entergy Mississippi is subject to an annual \u201clook-back\u201d evaluation.  Entergy Mississippi is allowed a maximum rate increase of 4% of each test year\u2019s retail revenue.  Any increase above 4% requires a base rate case.  If Entergy Mississippi\u2019s formula rate plan were terminated without replacement, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan.  In August 2012 the MPSC opened inquiries to review whether the then current formulaic methodology used to calculate the return on common equity in both Entergy Mississippi\u2019s formula rate plan and Mississippi Power Company\u2019s annual formula rate plan was still appropriate or could be improved to better serve the public interest.  The intent of this inquiry and review was for informational purposes only; the evaluation of any recommendations for changes to the existing methodology would take place in a general rate case or in the existing formula rate plan proceeding.  In March 2013 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed its consultant\u2019s report which noted the return on common equity estimation methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company are commonly used throughout the electric utility industry.  The report suggested ways in which the methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company might be improved, but did not recommend specific changes in the return on common equity formulas or calculations at that time.  In June 2014 the MPSC expanded the scope of the August 2012 inquiry to study the merits of adopting a uniform formula rate plan that could be applied, where possible in whole or in part, to both Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company in order to achieve greater consistency in the plans.  The MPSC directed the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff to investigate and review Entergy Mississippi\u2019s formula rate plan rider schedule and Mississippi Power Company\u2019s Performance Evaluation Plan by considering the merits and deficiencies and possibilities for improvement of each and then to propose a uniform formula rate plan that, where possible, could be applicable to both companies.  No procedural schedule has been set.  In October 2014 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff conducted a public technical conference to discuss performance benchmarking and its potential application to the electric utilities\u2019 formula rate plans.  The docket remains open.  In December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi\u2019s proposed revisions to its formula rate plan to provide for a mechanism in the formula rate plan, the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, to recover the non-fuel related costs of additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi as well as to allow similar cost recovery treatment for other capacity acquisitions that are approved by the MPSC.  The MPSC must approve recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment for each new resource.  In addition, the MPSC approved revisions to the formula rate plan which allows Entergy Mississippi to begin billing rate adjustments effective April  254 254 254 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  1 of the filing year on a temporary basis subject to refund or credit to customers, subject to final MPSC order.  The MPSC also authorized Entergy Mississippi to remove vegetation management costs from the formula rate plan and recover these costs through the establishment of a vegetation management rider.  Fuel Recovery  Entergy Mississippi\u2019s rate schedules include energy cost recovery riders to recover fuel and purchased power costs.\u00a0\u00a0The energy cost rate for each calendar year is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery of the energy costs as of the 12-month period ended September 30.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Mississippi\u2019s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC.  The energy cost recovery riders allow interim rate adjustments depending on the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.  To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Mississippi hedges approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year.\u00a0\u00a0The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.  Storm Cost Recovery  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of recovery of Entergy Mississippi\u2019s storm-related costs.  Entergy New Orleans  Formula Rate Plan  As part of its determination of rates in the base rate case filed by Entergy New Orleans in 2018, in November 2019, the City Council issued a resolution resolving the rate case, with rates to become effective retroactive to August 2019.  The resolution allows Entergy New Orleans to implement a three-year formula rate plan, beginning with the 2019 test year as adjusted for forward-looking known and measurable changes, with the filing for the first test year to be made in 2020.  As part of a settlement of Entergy New Orleans\u2019 appeal of the Council\u2019s decision in its 2018 base rate case, Entergy New Orleans agreed to postpone the filing of its first test year formula rate plan to 2021 and, in return, to be provided an additional test year for the three-year cycle.  Accordingly, Entergy New Orleans will submit its final formula rate plan filing of the three-year cycle in April 2023 unless the formula rate plan is extended or renewed.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion.  Fuel Recovery  Entergy New Orleans\u2019s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.  Entergy New Orleans\u2019s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.  To help stabilize gas costs, Entergy New Orleans seeks approval annually from the City Council to continue implementation of its natural gas hedging program consistent with the City Council\u2019s stated policy objectives.\u00a0 The program uses financial instruments to hedge exposure to volatility in the wholesale price of natural gas purchased to  255 255 255 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  serve Entergy New Orleans gas customers.\u00a0 Entergy New Orleans hedges up to 25% of actual gas sales made during the winter months.  Storm Cost Recovery  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy New Orleans\u2019s filings to recover storm-related costs.  Entergy Texas  Base Rates  The base rates of Entergy Texas are established largely in traditional base rate case proceedings.  Between base rate proceedings, Entergy Texas has available rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain incremental costs.  Entergy Texas is required to file full base rate case proceedings every four years and within eighteen months of utilizing its generation cost recovery rider for investments above $200 million.  Fuel Recovery  Entergy Texas\u2019s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including interest, that are not included in base rates.\u00a0\u00a0Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix.\u00a0\u00a0The amounts collected under Entergy Texas\u2019s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT every three years, at a minimum.  In the course of this reconciliation, the PUCT determines whether eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and reasonable and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts entered into during the reconciliation period.\u00a0\u00a0The PUCT fuel cost proceedings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.  At the PUCT\u2019s April\u00a02013 open meeting, the PUCT Commissioners discussed their view that a purchased power capacity rider was good public policy.  The PUCT issued an order in May 2013 adopting the rule allowing for a purchased power capacity rider, subject to an offsetting adjustment for load growth.  The rule, as adopted, also includes a process for obtaining pre-approval by the PUCT of purchased power agreements.  No Texas utility, including Entergy Texas, has exercised the option to recover capacity costs under the new rider mechanism, but Entergy Texas will continue to evaluate the benefits of utilizing the rider to recover future capacity costs.  Other Cost Recovery  As discussed above, Entergy Texas has available rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain incremental costs.  These riders include a transmission cost recovery factor rider mechanism for the recovery of transmission-related capital investments, a distribution cost recovery factor rider mechanism for the recovery of distribution-related capital investment, and a generation cost recovery rider mechanism for the recovery of generation-related capital investments.  In June 2009 a law was enacted in Texas containing provisions that allow Entergy Texas to take advantage of a cost recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission charges.  This mechanism was previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to Entergy Texas.  In September 2011 the PUCT adopted a proposed rule implementing a distribution cost recovery factor to recover capital and capital-related costs related to distribution infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0The distribution cost recovery factor permits utilities once per year to implement an increase or decrease in rates above or below amounts reflected in base rates to reflect distribution-related depreciation expense, federal income tax and other taxes, and return on  256 256 256 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  investment.\u00a0\u00a0The distribution cost recovery factor rider may be changed a maximum of four times between base rate cases.  In September 2019 the PUCT initiated a rulemaking to promulgate a generation cost recovery rider rule, implementing legislation passed in the 2019 Texas legislative session intended to allow electric utilities to recover generation investments between base rate proceedings.\u00a0 The PUCT approved the final rule in July 2020.  Storm Cost Recovery  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Texas\u2019s filings to recover storm-related costs.  Electric Industry Restructuring  In June 2009 a law was enacted in Texas that required Entergy Texas to cease all activities relating to Entergy Texas\u2019s transition to competition.\u00a0\u00a0The law allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC) Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas from joining another power region.\u00a0\u00a0The law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist.\u00a0\u00a0Under the law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to competition plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT\u2019s certification of a qualified power region for Entergy Texas.  The law further amended already existing law that had required Entergy Texas to propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive generation.\u00a0\u00a0The amending language in the law provides, among other things, that:\u00a01) the tariff shall not be implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall \u201cpurchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer;\u201d and 3)\u00a0Entergy Texas shall provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of service.\u00a0\u00a0The law directs that the PUCT may not issue an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction.  The PUCT determined that unrecovered costs that may be recovered through the rider consist only of those costs necessary to implement and administer the competitive generation program and do not include lost revenues or embedded generation costs.\u00a0\u00a0The amount of customer load that may be included in the competitive generation service program is limited to 115 MW.  System Energy  Cost of Service  The rates of System Energy are established by the FERC, and the costs allowed to be charged pursuant to these rates are, in turn, passed through to the participating Utility operating companies through the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which has monthly billings that reflect the current operating costs of, and investment in, Grand Gulf.  Retail regulators and other parties may seek to initiate proceedings at FERC to investigate the prudence of costs included in the rates charged under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures, allowed rates of return and rate base, and previously incurred capital expenditures.  The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy\u2019s uncertain tax positions, sale leaseback arrangement, authorized return on equity and capital structure, and a separate proceeding for a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  In addition, certain of the Utility operating companies\u2019 retail regulators have filed a complaint at FERC challenging the 2012 extended power uprate of Grand Gulf and the operation and management of the plant, particularly during the time period 2016 - 2020.  Beginning in 2021, System Energy implemented billing protocols to provide retail regulators with  257 257 257 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  information regarding rates billed under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  Entergy cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings, and an adverse outcome in any of them could have a material adverse effect on Entergy\u2019s or System Energy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings.  Franchises  Entergy Arkansas holds exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 308 incorporated cities and towns in Arkansas.\u00a0\u00a0These franchises generally are unlimited in duration and continue unless the municipalities purchase the utility property.\u00a0\u00a0In Arkansas, franchises are considered to be contracts and, therefore, are governed pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement and applicable statutes.  Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 175 incorporated municipalities and in the unincorporated areas of approximately 59 parishes of Louisiana.\u00a0 Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide natural gas service to customers in the City of Baton Rouge and in East Baton Rouge Parish.\u00a0 Municipal franchise agreement terms range from 25 to 60 years while parish franchise terms range from 25 to 99 years.  Entergy Mississippi has received from the MPSC certificates of public convenience and necessity to provide electric service to areas within 45 counties, including a number of municipalities, in western Mississippi.\u00a0\u00a0Under Mississippi statutory law, such certificates are exclusive.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Mississippi may continue to serve in such municipalities upon payment of a statutory franchise fee, regardless of whether an original municipal franchise is still in existence.  Entergy New Orleans provides electric and gas service in the City of New Orleans pursuant to indeterminate permits set forth in city ordinances.\u00a0\u00a0These ordinances contain a continuing option for the City of New Orleans to purchase Entergy New Orleans\u2019s electric and gas utility properties.  Entergy Texas holds a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT to provide electric service to areas within approximately 27 counties in eastern Texas and holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 70 incorporated municipalities.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Texas typically obtains 25-year franchise agreements as existing agreements expire.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Texas\u2019s electric franchises expire over the period 2023-2058.  The business of System Energy is limited to wholesale power sales.\u00a0\u00a0It has no distribution franchises.  258 258 258 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  Property and Other Generation Resources  Owned Generating Stations  The total capability of the generating stations owned and leased by the Utility operating companies and System Energy as of December\u00a031, 2022 is indicated below: \u00a0Owned and Leased Capability MW(a)CompanyTotalCT / CCGT (b)Legacy Gas/OilNuclearCoalHydroSolarEntergy Arkansas5,276\u00a01,567\u00a0522\u00a01,822\u00a01,192\u00a073\u00a0100\u00a0Entergy Louisiana10,829\u00a05,595\u00a02,766\u00a02,129\u00a0339\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Entergy Mississippi2,857\u00a01,738\u00a0707\u00a0\u2014\u00a0310\u00a0\u2014\u00a0102\u00a0Entergy New Orleans663\u00a0636\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a027\u00a0Entergy Texas3,190\u00a0980\u00a01,960\u00a0\u2014\u00a0250\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0System Energy1,260\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a01,260\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Total24,075\u00a010,516\u00a05,955\u00a05,211\u00a02,091\u00a073\u00a0229\u00a0  (a)\u201cOwned and Leased Capability\u201d is the dependable load carrying capability as demonstrated under actual operating conditions based on the primary fuel (assuming no curtailments) that each station was designed to utilize. (b)Represents Simple Cycle Combustion Turbine units and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine units.  Summer peak load for the Utility has averaged 21,602 MW over the previous decade.  The Utility operating companies\u2019 load and capacity projections are reviewed periodically to assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity and interconnections.  These reviews consider existing and projected demand, the availability and price of power, the location of new load, the economy, Entergy\u2019s clean energy and other public policy goals, environmental regulations, and the age and condition of Entergy\u2019s existing infrastructure.  The Utility operating companies\u2019 long-term resource strategy (Portfolio Transformation Strategy) calls for the bulk of capacity needs to be met through long-term resources, whether owned or contracted.  Over the past decade, the Portfolio Transformation Strategy has resulted in the addition of about 8,975 MW of new long-term resources and the deactivation of about 4,881 MW of legacy generation.  As MISO market participants, the Utility operating companies also participate in MISO\u2019s Day Ahead and Real Time Energy and Ancillary Services markets to economically dispatch generation and purchase energy to serve customers reliably and at the lowest reasonable cost.  259 259 259 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  Other Generation Resources  RFP Procurements  The Utility operating companies from time to time issue requests for proposals (RFP) to procure supply-side resources from sources other than the spot market to meet the unique regional needs of the Utility operating companies.  The RFPs issued by the Utility operating companies have sought resources needed to meet near-term MISO reliability requirements as well as long-term requirements through a broad range of wholesale power products, including long-term contractual products and asset acquisitions.  The RFP process has resulted in selections or acquisitions, including, among other things:  \u2022Entergy Louisiana\u2019s construction of the 980 MW, combined-cycle, gas turbine J. Wayne Leonard Power Station (previously referred to as the St. Charles generating facility) at its existing Little Gypsy electric generating station.  The facility began commercial operation in May 2019; \u2022Entergy Louisiana\u2019s construction of the 994 MW, combined-cycle, gas turbine Lake Charles generating facility at its existing Nelson electric generating station site.  The facility began commercial operation in March 2020; \u2022Entergy Texas\u2019s construction of the 993 MW, combined-cycle, gas turbine Montgomery County Power Station at its existing Lewis Creek electric generating station.  The facility began commercial operation in January 2021; \u2022Entergy New Orleans\u2019s construction of the 20 MW solar photovoltaic facility, New Orleans Solar Station, located at the NASA Michoud Facility.  The facility began commercial operation in December 2020;  \u2022In December 2020, Entergy Texas selected the self-build alternative, Orange County Advanced Power Station, out of the 2020 Entergy Texas combined-cycle, gas turbine RFP.  Regulatory approval was received in November 2022 and construction has commenced.  The facility is expected to be in service by mid-2026; \u2022In March 2019, Entergy Arkansas signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 100 MW to-be-constructed solar photovoltaic energy facility, Searcy Solar facility, sited on approximately 800 acres in White County near Searcy, Arkansas.  Entergy Arkansas received regulatory approval from the APSC in April 2020, and closed on the acquisition, through use of a tax equity partnership, in December 2021.  The Searcy Solar facility was placed in service in January 2022; \u2022In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 100 MW to-be-constructed solar photovoltaic energy facility, Sunflower Solar facility, sited on approximately 1,000 acres in Sunflower County, Mississippi.  Entergy Mississippi received regulatory approval from the MPSC in April 2020, and the Sunflower Solar facility began commercial operation in September 2022; \u2022In June 2020, Entergy Arkansas signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 100 MW to-be-constructed solar photovoltaic energy facility, Walnut Bend Solar facility, that will be sited on approximately 1,000 acres in Lee County, Arkansas.  In July 2021 the APSC issued an order approving the acquisition of the Walnut Bend Solar facility.  The counter-party notified Entergy Arkansas that it was terminating the project, though it was willing to consider an alternative for the site.  Entergy Arkansas disputed the right of termination.  Negotiations are ongoing, including with respect to cost and schedule and to updates arising as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and the updates would require additional APSC approval.  At this time the project, if approved, is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2024; \u2022In September 2020, Entergy Arkansas signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 180 MW to-be-constructed solar photovoltaic energy facility, West Memphis Solar facility, that will be sited on approximately 1,500 acres in Crittenden County, Arkansas.  In October 2021 the APSC issued an order approving the acquisition of the West Memphis Solar facility.  The counter-party notified Entergy Arkansas that it was seeking changes to certain terms of the build-own-transfer agreement, including both cost and schedule.  In January 2023, Entergy Arkansas made a supplemental filing with the APSC.  Following APSC supplemental approval, full notice to proceed will be issued with closing expected to occur in 2024; 260 260 260 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  \u2022In November 2021, Entergy Louisiana signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 150 MW to-be-constructed solar photovoltaic energy facility, St. Jacques facility, that will be sited in St. James Parish near Vacherie, Louisiana.  In September 2022 the LPSC voted to approve the order including the St. Jacques facility; however, project details could be adjusted pending a final St. James Parish ruling on land use permit requirements.  Closing is expected to occur in 2025 dependent upon the final St. James Parish ruling; and \u2022In August 2022, Entergy Arkansas signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 250 MW to-be-constructed solar photovoltaic energy facility, Driver Solar facility, that will be sited near Osceola, Arkansas.  Also in August 2022, Entergy Arkansas received necessary approvals for the Driver Solar facility, and Entergy Arkansas has issued the counter-party full notice to proceed to begin construction.  The parties are evaluating the effects of certain matters related to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, including the viability of a tax equity partnership.  Closing is expected to occur by the end of 2024.  The RFP process has also resulted in the selection, or confirmation of the economic merits of, long-term purchased power agreements (PPAs), including, among others:  \u2022River Bend\u2019s 30% life-of-unit PPA between Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans for 100 MW related to Entergy Louisiana\u2019s unregulated portion of the River Bend nuclear station, which portion was formerly owned by Cajun;   \u2022Entergy Arkansas\u2019s wholesale base load capacity life-of-unit PPAs executed in 2003 totaling approximately 220 MW between Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana (110 MW) and between Entergy Arkansas and Entergy New Orleans (110 MW) related to the sale of a portion of Entergy Arkansas\u2019s coal and nuclear base load resources (which had not been included in Entergy Arkansas\u2019s retail rates); \u2022In September 2012, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana executed a 20-year agreement for 28 MW, with the potential to purchase an additional 9 MW when available, from Rain CII Carbon LLC\u2019s petroleum coke calcining facility in Sulphur, Louisiana.

The  263 263 263 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  Utility operating companies have also entered into various limited- and long-term contracts in recent years as a result of bilateral negotiations.  The Washington Parish Energy Center is a 361 MW natural gas-fired peaking power plant approximately 60 miles north of New Orleans on a site Entergy Louisiana purchased from Calpine in 2019.  In May 2018, Entergy Louisiana received LPSC approval of its certification application for this simple-cycle power plant to be developed pursuant to an agreement between Calpine and Entergy Louisiana.  Calpine began construction on the plant in early 2019 and Entergy Louisiana purchased the plant upon completion in November 2020.  The Hardin County Peaking Facility, an existing 147 MW simple-cycle gas-fired peaking power plant in Kountze, Texas, previously owned by East Texas Electric Cooperative, was acquired by Entergy Texas in June 2021.  The facility has been in operation since January 2010.  Power Through Programs  In December 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to amend its certificate of convenience and necessity to own and operate up to 75 MW of natural gas-fired distributed generation to be installed at commercial and industrial customer premises.  Under this proposal, Entergy Texas would own and operate a fleet of generators ranging from 100 kW to 10 MW that would supply a portion of Entergy Texas\u2019s long-term resource needs and enhance the resiliency of Entergy Texas\u2019s electric grid.  This fleet of generators would also be available to customers during outages to supply backup electric service as part of a program known as \u201cPower Through.\u201d  In its 2021 session, the Texas legislature modified the Texas Utilities Code to exempt generators under 10 megawatts from the requirement to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity.  In addition, the PUCT announced an intent to conduct a broad rulemaking related to distributed generation and recommended that utilities with pending applications addressing distributed generation withdraw them.  Accordingly, Entergy Texas withdrew its application for a certificate of convenience and necessity and associated tariff from the PUCT without prejudice to refiling.  Entergy Texas continues to deploy certain customer-sited distributed generators under an existing PUCT-approved tariff.  In August 2022, Entergy Texas filed an application for PUCT approval of voluntary Rate Schedule Utility Owned Distributed Generation (UODG) through which it would charge host customers for back-up service from customer-sited Power Through generators.  Based on the exemption enacted by the Texas legislature in 2021, Entergy Texas\u2019s application was not required to, and did not, seek an amendment to its certificate of convenience and necessity in order to continue deploying Power Through generators.  In October 2022 two intervenors filed requests for a hearing on Entergy Texas\u2019s application.  In October 2022 the PUCT staff filed a request that the proceeding be referred to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  In January 2023 the PUCT announced an intent to develop certain broadly applicable reliability metrics against which to measure distributed generation resources and directed Entergy Texas to withdraw its application.  However, the PUCT did allow Entergy Texas to continue its pilot program for Power Through generators.  Entergy Texas has withdrawn its application and is considering next steps.  In August 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC an application for authority to deploy natural gas-fired distributed generation.  The application was supported by a number of letters of interest from Entergy Arkansas customers.  In December 2021 the APSC general staff requested briefing, which Entergy Arkansas opposed.  In January 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed to support the establishment of a procedural schedule with a hearing in April 2022.  Also in January 2022, the APSC granted the general staff\u2019s request for briefing but on an expedited schedule; briefing concluded in February 2022.  Based on testimony filed to date the APSC general staff, Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Sierra Club, and Audubon oppose Entergy Arkansas\u2019s proposed \u201cPower Through\u201d offering, which has been demonstrated to be in high demand by interested customers, some of which directly have filed public comments encouraging the APSC to approve the application.  A paper hearing was held in August and September 2022 with Entergy Arkansas responding to several written commissioner questions.  The parties are awaiting a decision from the APSC.  264 264 264 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  In July 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application for authority to deploy natural gas-fired distributed generation.  The application was supported by a number of letters of interest from Entergy Louisiana customers.  In October 2021, a procedural schedule was established with a hearing in April 2022.  Staff and certain intervenors filed direct testimony in December 2021, and cross-answering testimony was filed in January 2022.  Entergy Louisiana filed rebuttal testimony in February 2022.  The parties reached an uncontested settlement which, among other things, recommended approval of 120 MW of natural gas fired distributed generation and an additional 30 MW of solar and battery distributed generation, for a total distributed generation program of 150 MW.  Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, Entergy Louisiana may seek to expand the distributed generation program following the earlier of two years after issuance of an order approving the settlement or the installation of 60 MW of distributed generation pursuant to this program.  The settlement was approved by the LPSC in November 2022.  Interconnections  The Utility operating companies\u2019 generating units are interconnected to a transmission system operating at various voltages up to 500 kV.\u00a0\u00a0These generating units consist of steam-turbine generators fueled by natural gas and coal, combustion-turbine generators, and reciprocating internal combustion engine generators that are fueled by natural gas, generators powered by pressurized and boiling water nuclear reactors and inverter-based resources interconnecting both solar photovoltaic systems and energy storage devices that operate in the MISO wholesale electric market.  Additionally, some of the Utility operating companies also offer customer services and products that include resources interconnected to both the distribution and transmission systems that also participate in the wholesale market.  Entergy\u2019s Utility operating companies are MISO market participants and the companies\u2019 transmission systems are interconnected with those of many neighboring utilities.\u00a0\u00a0MISO is an essential link in the safe, cost-effective delivery of electric power across all or parts of 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba.  In addition, the Utility operating companies are members of SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), the Regional Entity with delegated authority from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) for the purpose of proposing and enforcing Bulk Electric System reliability standards within 16 central and southeastern states.

Although based on current economics the Utility does not expect fuel oil use in 2023, it is possible that various operational events including weather or pipeline maintenance may require the use of fuel oil.  Natural Gas  The Utility operating companies have long-term firm and short-term interruptible gas contracts for both supply and transportation.  Over 50% of the Utility operating companies\u2019 power plants maintain some level of long-term firm transportation.  Short-term contracts and spot-market purchases satisfy additional gas requirements.   267 267 267 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  Entergy Texas owns a gas storage facility and Entergy Louisiana has a firm storage service agreement that provide reliable and flexible natural gas service to certain generating stations.  Many factors, including wellhead deliverability, storage, pipeline capacity, and demand requirements of end users, influence the availability and price of natural gas supplies for power plants.  Demand is primarily tied to weather conditions as well as to the prices and availability of other energy sources.  Pursuant to federal and state regulations, gas supplies to power plants may be interrupted during periods of shortage.  To the extent natural gas supplies are disrupted or natural gas prices significantly increase, the Utility operating companies may in some instances use alternate fuels, such as oil when available, or rely to a larger extent on coal, nuclear generation, and purchased power.  Coal  Entergy Arkansas has committed to six two- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 85% of the total coal supply needs in 2023.  These contracts are staggered in term so that not all contracts have to be renewed the same year.  If needed, additional Powder River Basin (PRB) coal will be purchased through contracts with a term of less than one year to provide the remaining supply needs.  Based on the high cost of alternate sources, modes of transportation, and infrastructure improvements necessary for its delivery, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Entergy Arkansas during 2023.  Coal will be transported to Arkansas via an existing Union Pacific transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy Arkansas\u2019s rail transportation requirements for 2023.  Entergy Louisiana has committed to four two- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 90% of Nelson Unit 6 coal needs in 2023.  If needed, additional PRB coal will be purchased through contracts with a term of less than one year to provide the remaining supply needs.  For the same reasons as the Entergy Arkansas plants, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Nelson Unit 6 during 2023.  Coal will be transported to Nelson via an existing transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy Louisiana\u2019s rail transportation requirements for 2023.  Coal transportation delivery rates to Entergy Arkansas- and Entergy Louisiana-operated coal-fired units became constrained and were unable to fully meet supply needs and obligations beginning in August 2021.  Deliveries remained constrained through 2022 with modest improvement expected later in 2023.  Both Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana control enough railcars to satisfy the rail transportation requirement.  The operator of Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3, Louisiana Generating, LLC, has advised Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas that it has adequate rail car and barge capacity to meet the volumes of PRB coal requested for 2023, but is also currently experiencing delivery constraints.  Entergy Louisiana\u2019s and Entergy Texas\u2019s coal nomination requests to Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3 are made on an annual basis.  Nuclear Fuel  The nuclear fuel cycle consists of the following:  \u2022mining and milling of uranium ore to produce a concentrate; \u2022conversion of the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride gas; \u2022enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride gas; \u2022fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies for use in fueling nuclear reactors; and \u2022disposal of spent fuel.  The Registrant Subsidiaries that own nuclear plants, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, are responsible through a shared regulated uranium pool for contracts to acquire nuclear material to be used in fueling Entergy\u2019s Utility nuclear units.\u00a0\u00a0These companies own the materials and services in this shared regulated  268 268 268 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  uranium pool on a pro rata fractional basis determined by the nuclear generation capability of each company.\u00a0\u00a0Any liabilities for obligations of the pooled contracts are on a several but not joint basis.\u00a0\u00a0The shared regulated uranium pool maintains inventories of nuclear materials during the various stages of processing.\u00a0\u00a0The Registrant Subsidiaries purchase enriched uranium hexafluoride for their nuclear plant reload requirements at the average inventory cost from the shared regulated uranium pool.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Operations, Inc. contracts separately for the fabrication of nuclear fuel as agent on behalf of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries that owns a nuclear plant.\u00a0\u00a0All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and the owner of a nuclear power plant.  Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, the Utility nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable or fixed prices through most of 2027.  Entergy\u2019s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners, including their ability to work through supply disruptions caused by global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or national events, such as political disruption.\u00a0\u00a0There are a number of possible supply alternatives that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, including potentially drawing upon Entergy\u2019s inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, some nuclear fuel contracts are on a non-fixed price basis subject to prevailing prices at the time of delivery.  The effects of market price changes may be reduced and deferred by risk management strategies, such as negotiation of floor and ceiling amounts for long-term contracts, buying for inventory or entering into forward physical contracts at fixed prices when Entergy believes it is appropriate and useful.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S.  Entergy\u2019s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers.  There are fewer of these providers than for uranium.  For conversion and enrichment services, like uranium, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures as needed to ensure supply of enriched uranium for the reliable fabrication of nuclear fuel.  For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the effective performance of the fabricator of that plant\u2019s nuclear fuel, therefore, Entergy provides additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight for the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have made arrangements to lease nuclear fuel and related equipment and services.\u00a0\u00a0The lessors, which are consolidated in the financial statements of Entergy and the applicable Registrant Subsidiary, finance the acquisition and ownership of nuclear fuel through credit agreements and the issuance of notes.\u00a0\u00a0These credit facilities are subject to periodic renewal, and the notes are issued periodically, typically for terms between three and seven years.  Natural Gas Purchased for Resale  Entergy New Orleans has several suppliers of natural gas.  Its system is interconnected with one interstate and three intrastate pipelines.  Entergy New Orleans has a \u201cno-notice\u201d service gas purchase contract with Symmetry Energy Solutions which guarantees Entergy New Orleans gas delivery at specific delivery points and at any volume within the minimum and maximum set forth in the contract amounts.  The Symmetry Energy Solutions gas supply is transported to Entergy New Orleans pursuant to a transportation service agreement with Gulf South Pipeline Co.  This service is subject to FERC-approved rates.  Entergy New Orleans also makes interruptible spot market purchases.  Entergy Louisiana purchased natural gas for resale in 2022 under a firm contract from Sequent Energy Management L.P.  The gas is delivered through a combination of intrastate and interstate pipelines. 269 269 269 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy   As a result of the implementation of FERC-mandated interstate pipeline restructuring in 1993, curtailments of interstate gas supply could occur if Entergy Louisiana\u2019s or Entergy New Orleans\u2019s suppliers failed to perform their obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements.  Gulf South Pipeline Co. could curtail transportation capacity only in the event of pipeline system constraints.  Federal Regulation of the Utility  State or local regulatory authorities, as described above, regulate the retail rates of the Utility operating companies.\u00a0\u00a0The FERC regulates wholesale sales of electricity rates and interstate transmission of electricity, including System Energy\u2019s sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of federal regulation proceedings.  Transmission and MISO Markets  In December 2013 the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO.  Although becoming a member of MISO did not affect the ownership by the Utility operating companies of their transmission facilities or the responsibility for maintaining those facilities, MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies.  MISO also exercises functional control of transmission planning and congestion management and provides schedules and pricing for the commitment and dispatch of generation that is offered into MISO\u2019s markets, as well as pricing for load that bids into the markets.  The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules.  Each Utility operating company has its own transmission pricing zone and a formula rate template (included as Attachment O to the MISO tariff) used to establish transmission rates within MISO.  The terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by the FERC.  System Energy and Related Agreements  System Energy recovers costs related to its interest in Grand Gulf through rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement (described below).\u00a0\u00a0In 1998 the FERC approved requests by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their Grand Gulf purchased power obligations.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Arkansas\u2019s and Entergy Mississippi\u2019s acceleration of Grand Gulf purchased power obligations ceased effective July 2001 and July 2003, respectively, as approved by the FERC.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of proceedings at the FERC related to System Energy.  Unit Power Sales Agreement  The Unit Power Sales Agreement allocates capacity, energy, and the related costs from System Energy\u2019s ownership and leasehold interests in Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas (36%), Entergy Louisiana (14%), Entergy Mississippi (33%), and Entergy New Orleans (17%).\u00a0\u00a0Each of these companies is obligated to make payments to System Energy for its entitlement of capacity and energy on a full cost-of-service basis regardless of the quantity of energy delivered.\u00a0\u00a0Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy\u2019s only source of operating revenue.\u00a0\u00a0The financial condition of System Energy depends upon the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and the receipt of such payments.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans generally recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales Agreement through rates charged to their customers. 270 270 270 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy   In the case of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana, payments are also recovered through sales of electricity from their respective retained shares of Grand Gulf.\u00a0\u00a0Under a settlement agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985 and amended in 1988, Entergy Arkansas retains 22% of its 36% share of Grand Gulf-related costs and recovers the remaining 78% of its share in rates.\u00a0\u00a0In the event that Entergy Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share to third parties, it may sell such energy to its retail customers at a price equal to its avoided cost, which is currently less than Entergy Arkansas\u2019s cost from its retained share.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Arkansas has life-of-resources purchased power agreements with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans that sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas\u2019s retained share of Grand Gulf to those companies, with the remainder of the retained share being sold to Entergy Mississippi through a separate life-of-resources purchased power agreement.\u00a0\u00a0In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions, and agreements from late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted cost recovery with respect to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana\u2019s share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf, subject to certain terms and conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Louisiana retains and does not recover from retail ratepayers 18% of its 14% share of the costs of Grand Gulf capacity and energy and recovers the remaining 82% of its share in rates.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover through the fuel adjustment clause at 4.6 cents per kWh for the energy related to its retained portion of these costs.\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to non-affiliated parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery amount, subject to the LPSC\u2019s approval.  Entergy Arkansas also has a life-of-resources purchased power agreement with Entergy Mississippi to sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas\u2019s non-retained share of Grand Gulf.  Entergy Mississippi was granted cost recovery for those purchases by the MPSC through its annual unit power cost rate mechanism.  Availability Agreement  The Availability Agreement among System Energy and Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans was entered into in 1974 in connection with the original financing by System Energy of Grand Gulf.  The Availability Agreement provides that System Energy make available to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans all capacity and energy available from System Energy\u2019s share of Grand Gulf.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans also agreed severally to pay System Energy monthly for the right to receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in amounts that (when added to any amounts received by System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement) would at least equal System Energy\u2019s total operating expenses for Grand Gulf (including depreciation at a specified rate and expenses incurred in a permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf) and interest charges.  The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement are fixed as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 17.1%; Entergy Louisiana - 26.9%; Entergy Mississippi - 31.3%; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7%.  The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in effect and would govern payments made under such agreement in the event of a shortfall of operating expense funds available to System Energy from other sources, including payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  System Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under the Availability Agreement as security for all of its outstanding series of first mortgage bonds, as well as for its outstanding term loan and the pollution control revenue refunding bonds issued on its behalf.\u00a0\u00a0In these assignments, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans further agreed that, in the event they were prohibited by governmental action from making payments under the Availability Agreement (for example, if the FERC reduced or disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would then make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and at the same times as the prohibited payments.  System Energy would not be allowed to repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in default under the related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances.  271 271 271 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  Each of the assignment agreements relating to the Availability Agreement provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans will make payments directly to System Energy.  However, if there is an event of default, those payments must be made directly to the holders of indebtedness that are the beneficiaries of such assignment agreements.  The payments must be made pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations secured.  The obligations of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans to make payments under the Availability Agreement are subject to the receipt and continued effectiveness of all necessary regulatory approvals.\u00a0\u00a0Sales of capacity and energy under the Availability Agreement would require that the Availability Agreement be submitted to the FERC for approval with respect to the terms of such sale.  No such filing with the FERC has been made because sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0If, for any reason, sales of capacity and energy are made in the future pursuant to the Availability Agreement, the jurisdictional portions of the Availability Agreement would be submitted to the FERC for approval.  Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to System Energy have exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement and, therefore, no payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required.\u00a0\u00a0If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or certain of its creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments because their Availability Agreement obligations exceed their Unit Power Sales Agreement obligations.  The Availability Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, without further consent of any assignees or other creditors.  Service Companies  Entergy Services, a limited liability company wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation, provides management, administrative, accounting, legal, engineering, and other services primarily to the Utility operating companies, but also provides services to Entergy Wholesale Commodities.  Entergy Operations is also wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation and provides nuclear management, operations and maintenance services under contract for ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, subject to the owner oversight of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Services and Entergy Operations provide their services to the Utility operating companies and System Energy on an \u201cat cost\u201d basis, pursuant to cost allocation methodologies for these service agreements that were approved by the FERC.  Jurisdictional Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas  Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Texas owns all Entergy Gulf States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.\u2019s 70% ownership interest in Nelson Unit 6 and 42% ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent related to utility operations in Texas.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Louisiana, as successor in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc.\u00a0 On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas.  272 272 272 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  Entergy Texas purchases from Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a life-of-unit purchased power agreement a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail regulation.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend\u2019s nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the plant\u2019s output purchased by Entergy Texas under the purchased power agreement.\u00a0\u00a0In connection with the termination of the System Agreement effective August 31, 2016, the purchased power agreements that were put in place for certain legacy units at the time of the jurisdictional separation were also terminated at that time.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the purchased power agreements.  Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Business Combination  On October 1, 2015, the businesses formerly conducted by Entergy Louisiana (Old Entergy Louisiana) and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana (Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) were combined into a single public utility.  In order to effect the business combination, under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Old Entergy Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (New Entergy Louisiana), and New Entergy Louisiana assumed the liabilities of Old Entergy Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.  Under the TXBOC, Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) and New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana assumed the liabilities of Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.

The majority of Entergy Wholesale Commodities\u2019 owned generation and contracted power purchases are sold under cost-based contract.  Other Business Activities  TLG Services, a subsidiary in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment, offers decommissioning, engineering, and related services to nuclear power plant owners.   Regulation of Entergy\u2019s Business  Federal Power Act  The Federal Power Act provides the FERC the authority to regulate:  \u2022the transmission and wholesale sale of electric energy in interstate commerce; \u2022the reliability of the high voltage interstate transmission system through reliability standards; \u2022sale or acquisition of certain assets; \u2022securities issuances; \u2022the licensing of certain hydroelectric projects; \u2022certain other activities, including accounting policies and practices of electric and gas utilities; and \u2022changes in control of FERC jurisdictional entities or rate schedules.  The Federal Power Act gives the FERC jurisdiction over the rates charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf capacity and energy provided to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans and over the rates charged by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana to unaffiliated wholesale customers.  The FERC also regulates wholesale power sales between the Utility operating companies.  In addition, the FERC regulates the MISO RTO, an independent entity that maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy, capacity, and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies.  FERC regulation of the MISO RTO includes regulation of the design and implementation of the wholesale markets administered by the MISO RTO, as  275 275 275 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  well as the rates, terms, and conditions of open access transmission service over the member systems and the allocation of costs associated with transmission upgrades.  Entergy Arkansas holds a FERC license that expires in 2053 for two hydroelectric projects totaling 65 MW of capacity.  State Regulation  Utility  Entergy Arkansas is subject to regulation by the APSC as to the following:  \u2022utility service; \u2022utility service areas; \u2022retail rates and charges, including depreciation rates; \u2022fuel cost recovery, including audits of the energy cost recovery rider; \u2022terms and conditions of service; \u2022service standards; \u2022the acquisition, sale, or lease of any public utility plant or property constituting an operating unit or system; \u2022certificates of convenience and necessity and certificates of environmental compatibility and public need, as applicable, for generating and transmission facilities; \u2022avoided cost payments to non-exempt Qualifying Facilities; \u2022net energy metering; \u2022integrated resource planning; \u2022utility mergers and acquisitions and other changes of control; and \u2022the issuance and sale of certain securities.  Additionally, Entergy Arkansas serves a limited number of retail customers in Tennessee.  Pursuant to legislation enacted in Tennessee, Entergy Arkansas is subject to complaints before the Tennessee Regulatory Authority only if it fails to treat its retail customers in Tennessee in the same manner as its retail customers in Arkansas.  Additionally, Entergy Arkansas maintains limited facilities in Missouri but does not provide retail electric service to customers in Missouri.  Although Entergy Arkansas obtained a certificate with respect to its Missouri facilities, Entergy Arkansas is not subject to retail ratemaking jurisdiction in Missouri.

Entergy New Orleans is subject to regulation by the City Council as to the following:  \u2022utility service; \u2022retail rates and charges, including depreciation rates; \u2022fuel cost recovery, including audits of the fuel adjustment charge and purchased gas adjustment charge; \u2022terms and conditions of service; \u2022service standards; \u2022audit of the environmental adjustment charge; \u2022certification of the construction or extension of any new plant, equipment, property, or facility that comprises more than 2% of the utility\u2019s rate base; \u2022integrated resource planning; \u2022net energy metering; \u2022avoided cost payments to non-exempt Qualifying Facilities; \u2022issuance and sale of certain securities; and \u2022utility mergers and acquisitions and other changes of control.  To the extent authorized by governing legislation, Entergy Texas is subject to the original jurisdiction of the municipal authorities of a number of incorporated cities in Texas with appellate jurisdiction over such matters residing in the PUCT.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy Texas is also subject to regulation by the PUCT as to the following:  \u2022retail rates and charges, including depreciation rates, and terms and conditions of service in unincorporated areas of its service territory, and in municipalities that have ceded jurisdiction to the PUCT; \u2022fuel recovery, including reconciliations (audits) of the fuel adjustment charges; \u2022service standards; \u2022certification of certain transmission and generation projects; \u2022utility service areas, including extensions into new areas; \u2022avoided cost payments to non-exempt Qualifying Facilities; \u2022net energy metering; and \u2022utility mergers, sales/acquisitions/leases of plants over $10 million, sales of greater than 50% voting stock of utilities, and transfers of controlling interest in or operation of utilities.  277 277 277 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry  Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and Energy Reorganization Act of 1974  Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the operation of nuclear plants is heavily regulated by the NRC, which has broad power to impose licensing and safety-related requirements.\u00a0\u00a0The NRC has broad authority to impose civil penalties or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, as owners of all or portions of ANO, River Bend and Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively, and Entergy Operations, as the licensee and operator of these units, are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC.  Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982  Spent Nuclear Fuel  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is required, for a specified fee, to construct storage facilities for, and to dispose of, all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by domestic nuclear power reactors.  Entergy\u2019s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have been charged fees for the estimated future disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.  The affected Entergy companies entered into contracts with the DOE, whereby the DOE is to furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for generation prior to that date.  Entergy Arkansas is the only one of the Utility operating companies that generated electric power with nuclear fuel prior to that date and has a recorded liability as of December\u00a031, 2022 of $195.0 million for the one-time fee.  The fees payable to the DOE may be adjusted in the future to assure full recovery.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy considers all costs incurred for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued interest, to be proper components of nuclear fuel expense.\u00a0\u00a0Provisions to recover such costs have been or will be made in applications to regulatory authorities for the Utility plants.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy\u2019s total spent fuel fees to date, including the one-time fee liability of Entergy Arkansas, have surpassed $1.7 billion (exclusive of amounts relating to Entergy plants that were paid or are owed by prior owners of those plants).  The permanent spent fuel repository in the U.S. has been legislated to be Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  The DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing (the DOE filed the license application in June 2008) and, after the license is granted by the NRC, proceed with the repository construction and commencement of receipt of spent fuel.  Because the DOE has not begun accepting spent fuel, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts.  The DOE continues to delay meeting its obligation.  Specific steps were taken to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project, including a motion to the NRC to withdraw the license application with prejudice and the establishment of a commission to develop recommendations for alternative spent fuel storage solutions.  In August 2013 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered the NRC to continue with the Yucca Mountain license review, but only to the extent of funds previously appropriated by Congress for that purpose and not yet used.  Although the NRC completed the safety evaluation report for the license review in 2015, the previously appropriated funds are not sufficient to complete the review, including required hearings.  The government has taken no effective action to date related to the recommendations of the appointed spent fuel study commission.  Accordingly, large uncertainty remains regarding the time frame under which the DOE will begin to accept spent fuel from Entergy\u2019s facilities for storage or disposal.  As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at Entergy\u2019s nuclear sites.  Following the defunding of the Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository program, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and others sued the government seeking cessation of collection of the one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983 fee.  In November 2013 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the DOE to submit a proposal to Congress to reset the fee to zero until the DOE complies with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or Congress enacts an alternative waste disposal plan.  In January 2014 the DOE submitted the  278 278 278 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  proposal to Congress under protest, and also filed a petition for rehearing with the D.C. Circuit.  The petition for rehearing was denied.  The zero spent fuel fee went into effect prospectively in May 2014.  As a result of the DOE\u2019s failure to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the spent fuel disposal contracts, Entergy\u2019s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur damages.  These subsidiaries have been, and continue to be, involved in litigation to recover the damages caused by the DOE\u2019s delay in performance.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of final judgments recorded by Entergy in 2020, 2021, and 2022 related to Entergy\u2019s nuclear owner licensee subsidiaries\u2019 litigation with the DOE.  Through 2022, Entergy\u2019s subsidiaries have won and collected on judgments against the government totaling approximately $1 billion.  Pending DOE acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the owners of nuclear plants are providing their own spent fuel storage.\u00a0\u00a0Storage capability additions using dry casks began operations at ANO in 1996, at River Bend in 2005, at Grand Gulf in 2006, and at Waterford 3 in 2011.\u00a0\u00a0These facilities will be expanded as needed.  Nuclear Plant Decommissioning  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy are entitled to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning costs for ANO, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas are entitled to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning costs for the portion of River Bend subject to retail rate regulation.  The collections are deposited in trust funds that can only be used in accordance with NRC and other applicable regulatory requirements.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy periodically reviews and updates the estimated decommissioning costs to reflect inflation and changes in regulatory requirements and technology, and then makes applications to the regulatory authorities to reflect, in rates, the changes in projected decommissioning costs.  In December 2018 the APSC ordered collections in rates for decommissioning ANO 2 and found that ANO 1\u2019s decommissioning was adequately funded without additional collections.  In November 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed a revised decommissioning cost recovery tariff for ANO indicating that both ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trusts were adequately funded without further collections, and in December 2021 the APSC ordered zero collections for ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning.  In November 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed a revised decommissioning cost recovery tariff for ANO indicating that ANO 1\u2019s decommissioning trust was adequately funded, but that ANO 2\u2019s fund had a projected shortage as a result of a decline in decommissioning trust fund investment values over the past year.  The filing proposes a reinstatement of decommissioning cost recovery for ANO 2.  Management cannot predict the outcome of this filing.  In July 2010 the LPSC approved increased decommissioning collections for Waterford 3 and the Louisiana regulated share of River Bend to address previously identified funding shortfalls.  This LPSC decision contemplated that the level of decommissioning collections could be revisited should the NRC grant license extensions for both Waterford 3 and River Bend.  In July 2019, following the NRC approval of license extensions for Waterford 3 and River Bend, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking to adjust decommissioning and depreciation rates for those plants, including one proposed scenario that would adjust Louisiana-jurisdictional decommissioning collections to zero for both plants (including an offsetting increase in depreciation rates).  Because of the ongoing public health emergency arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic uncertainty, Entergy Louisiana determined that the relief sought in the filing was no longer appropriate, and in November 2020, filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the proceeding.  Following that filing, in a December 2020 order, the LPSC dismissed the proceeding without prejudice.  In July 2021, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC to adjust Waterford 3 and River Bend decommissioning collections based on the latest site-specific decommissioning cost estimates for those plants.  The filing seeks to increase Waterford 3 decommissioning collections and decrease River Bend decommissioning collections.  The procedural schedule in the case has been suspended pending settlement negotiations.  Management cannot predict the outcome of this filing.  279 279 279 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  In December 2010 the PUCT approved increased decommissioning collections for the Texas share of River Bend to address previously identified funding shortfalls.\u00a0\u00a0In December 2018 the PUCT approved a settlement that eliminated River Bend decommissioning collections for the Texas jurisdictional share of the plant based on a determination by Entergy Texas that the existing decommissioning fund was adequate following license renewal.  In July 2022, Entergy Texas filed a rate case that proposed continuation of the cessation of River Bend decommissioning collections.  In December 2022, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties a motion to abate the hearing on the merits to give parties additional time to finalize a settlement, which was approved by the presiding ALJ along with an order for the parties to file monthly settlement status reports.  Management cannot predict the outcome of this filing.  In December 2016 the NRC issued a 20-year operating license renewal for Grand Gulf.  In a 2017 filing at the FERC, System Energy stated that with the renewed operating license, Grand Gulf\u2019s decommissioning trust was sufficiently funded, and proposed, among other things, to cease decommissioning collections for Grand Gulf effective October 1, 2017.  The FERC accepted a settlement including the proposed decommissioning revenue requirement by letter order in August 2018.  Entergy currently believes its decommissioning funding will be sufficient for its nuclear plants subject to retail rate regulation, although decommissioning cost inflation and trust fund performance will ultimately determine the adequacy of the funding amounts.  Plant owners are required to provide the NRC with a biennial report (annually for units that have shut down or will shut down within five years), based on values as of December 31, addressing the owners\u2019 ability to meet the NRC minimum funding levels.  Depending on the value of the trust funds, plant owners may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met.  In March 2021 filings with the NRC were made reporting on decommissioning funding for all of Entergy\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 nuclear plants.  Those reports showed that decommissioning funding for each of the nuclear plants met the NRC\u2019s financial assurance requirements.  Additional information with respect to Entergy\u2019s decommissioning costs and decommissioning trust funds is found in Note 9 and Note 16 to the financial statements.  Price-Anderson Act  The Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase and maintain the maximum amount of nuclear liability insurance available and participate in an industry assessment program called Secondary Financial Protection in order to protect the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident.\u00a0\u00a0The costs of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry.\u00a0\u00a0Congress amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through 2025.\u00a0\u00a0The Price-Anderson Act limits the contingent liability for a single nuclear incident to a maximum assessment of approximately $137.6 million per reactor (with 96 nuclear industry reactors currently participating).\u00a0\u00a0In the case of a nuclear event in which Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, or System Energy is liable, protection is afforded through a combination of private insurance and the Secondary Financial Protection program.  In addition to this, insurance for property damage, costs of replacement power, and other risks relating to nuclear generating units is also purchased.\u00a0\u00a0The Price-Anderson Act and insurance applicable to the nuclear programs of Entergy are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to the financial statements.  NRC Reactor Oversight Process  The NRC\u2019s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response.  The NRC evaluates plant performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting from the NRC\u2019s inspection program and performance indicators reported by the licensee.  The evaluations result in the placement of  280 280 280 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  each plant in one of the NRC\u2019s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: \u201clicensee response column,\u201d or Column 1, \u201cregulatory response column,\u201d or Column 2, \u201cdegraded cornerstone column,\u201d or Column 3, and \u201cmultiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column,\u201d or Column 4, and \u201cunacceptable performance,\u201d or Column 5.  Plants in Column 1 are subject to normal NRC inspection activities.  Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject to progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC.  Continued plant operation is not permitted for plants in Column 5.  All of the nuclear generating plants owned and operated by Entergy\u2019s Utility business are currently in Column 1, except Waterford 3, which is in Column 2.  In September 2022 the NRC placed Waterford 3 in Column 2 based on an error associated with a radiation monitor calibration.  Entergy corrected the issue with the radiation monitor in February 2022; however, Waterford 3 is expected to remain in Column 2 until third quarter 2023 based on a subsequent radiation monitor calibration issue.  Environmental Regulation  Entergy\u2019s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.\u00a0\u00a0Management believes that Entergy\u2019s businesses are in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted below.\u00a0\u00a0Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance requirements and costs cannot be precisely estimated.\u00a0\u00a0Except to the extent discussed below, at this time compliance with federal, state, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise protecting the environment, is incorporated into the routine cost structure of Entergy\u2019s businesses and is not expected to have a material effect on their competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.  Clean Air Act and Subsequent Amendments  The Clean Air Act and its amendments establish several programs that currently or in the future may affect Entergy\u2019s fossil-fueled generation facilities and, to a lesser extent, certain operations at nuclear and other\u00a0facilities.\u00a0\u00a0Individual states also operate similar independent state programs or delegated federal programs that may include requirements more stringent than federal regulatory requirements.\u00a0\u00a0These programs include:  \u2022new source review and preconstruction permits for new sources of criteria air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and significant modifications to existing facilities; \u2022acid rain program for control of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx); \u2022nonattainment area programs for control of criteria air pollutants, which could include fee assessments for air pollutant emission sources under Section 185 of the Clean Air Act if attainment is not reached in a timely manner; \u2022hazardous air pollutant emissions reduction programs; \u2022Interstate Air Transport; \u2022operating permit programs and enforcement of these and other Clean Air Act programs; \u2022Regional Haze programs; and \u2022new and existing source standards for greenhouse gas and other air emissions.  National Ambient Air Quality Standards  The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide, and requires periodic review of those standards.  When an area fails to meet an ambient standard, it is considered to be in nonattainment and is classified as \u201cmarginal,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201cserious,\u201d or \u201csevere.\u201d  When an area fails to meet the ambient air standard, the EPA requires state regulatory authorities to prepare state implementation plans meant to cause progress toward bringing the area into attainment with applicable standards. 281 281 281 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy   Ozone Nonattainment  Entergy Texas operates two fossil-fueled generating facilities (Lewis Creek and Montgomery County Power Station) in a geographic area that is not in attainment with the applicable NAAQS for ozone.\u00a0\u00a0The ozone nonattainment area that affects Entergy Texas is the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area.\u00a0\u00a0Both Lewis Creek and the Montgomery County Power Station hold all necessary permits for operation and comply with applicable air quality program regulations.  Measures enacted to return the area to ozone attainment could make these program regulations more stringent.  Entergy will continue to work with state environmental agencies on appropriate methods for assessing attainment and nonattainment with the ozone NAAQS.  Potential SO2\u00a0Nonattainment  The EPA issued a final rule in June 2010 adopting an SO2 1-hour national ambient air quality standard of 75 parts per billion.\u00a0 In Entergy\u2019s utility service territory, only St. Bernard Parish and Evangeline Parish in Louisiana are designated as nonattainment.  In August 2017 the EPA issued a letter indicating that East Baton Rouge and St. Charles parishes would be designated by December 31, 2020, as monitors were installed to determine compliance.  In March 2021 the EPA published a final rule designating East Baton Rouge, St. Charles, St. James, and West Baton Rouge parishes in Louisiana as attainment/unclassifiable, and, in Texas, Jefferson County as attainment/unclassifiable and Orange County as unclassifiable.  No challenges to these final designations were filed within the 60 day deadline.  Entergy continues to monitor this situation.  Hazardous Air Pollutants  The EPA released the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) rule in December 2011, which had a compliance date, with a widely granted one-year extension, of April 2016.  The required controls have been installed and are operational at all affected Entergy units.  In May 2020 the EPA finalized a rule that finds that it is not \u201cappropriate and necessary\u201d to regulate hazardous air pollutants from electric steam generating units under the provisions of section 112(n) of the Clean Air Act.  This is a reversal of the EPA\u2019s previous finding requiring such regulation.  The final appropriate and necessary finding does not revise the underlying MATS rule.  Several lawsuits have been filed challenging the appropriate and necessary finding.  In February 2021 the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA\u2019s motion to hold the litigation in abeyance pending the agency\u2019s review of the appropriate and necessary rule.  In February 2022 the EPA issued a proposed rule revoking the 2020 rule and determining, again, that it is \u201cappropriate and necessary\u201d to regulate hazardous air pollutants.  The EPA is seeking additional information, which it could use to further tighten the standard.  Entergy will continue to monitor this situation.  Cross-State Air Pollution  In March 2005 the EPA finalized the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which was intended to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions from electric generation plants in order to improve air quality in twenty-nine eastern states.  The rule required a combination of capital investment to install pollution control equipment and increased operating costs through the purchase of emission allowances.  Entergy began implementation in 2007, including installation of controls at several facilities and the development of an emission allowance procurement strategy.  Based on several court challenges, CAIR and its subsequent versions, now known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), have been remanded to and modified by the EPA on multiple occasions.  In April 2022 the EPA published a rule to address interstate transport for the 2015 ozone NAAQS which will increase the stringency of the CSAPR program in all four of the states where the Utility operating companies operate.  If finalized as proposed, the rule will significantly reduce emission allowances and would likely require the installation of post-combustion nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions controls on any coal or large legacy gas units that will operate beyond 2026 and are not currently equipped with such controls.  Fifteen Entergy-owned units, totaling approximately 9,370 MW of total unit capacity, are identified by the EPA for selective catalytic reduction retrofits.   282 282 282 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  Based on the EPA estimates, Entergy\u2019s share of the capital costs would be approximately $1.6 billion if all the identified units were in fact retrofitted.  Additionally, the EPA is proposing controls on certain non-electric generating NOx sources.  Since releasing the proposed rule, the price for Group 3 NOx sources allowances has increased significantly, peaking at over $45,000 per allowance in late August 2022 before stabilizing in the range of $15,000 to $18,000 per allowance since September 2022.  Comments on the proposed rule were due in June 2022.  MISO, other impacted regional transmission organizations, and various state public service commissions all filed comments expressing reliability concerns if the rule is finalized as proposed.  Entergy filed individual comments which assert, in addition to other issues, that the EPA\u2019s proposal represents over-control of the Entergy units in Arkansas and Mississippi; the EPA should consider an alternative approach or provide flexibility for units with a limited remaining useful life; the EPA should consult with regional transmission organizations to determine the reliability impacts of the proposed rule; and the EPA should consider and incorporate current economic trends, including inflation, into any benefit-costs analysis supporting the rule.  Regional Haze  In June 2005 the EPA issued its final Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) regulations that potentially could result in a requirement to install SO2 and NOx pollution control technology as Best Available Retrofit Control Technology to continue operating certain of Entergy\u2019s fossil generation units.\u00a0\u00a0The rule leaves certain CAVR determinations to the states.  This rule establishes a series of 10-year planning periods, with states required to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for each planning period, with each SIP including such air pollution control measures as may be necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of the CAVR by the year 2064.  The various states are currently in the process of developing SIPs to implement the second planning period of the CAVR, which addresses the 2018-2028 planning period.  In January and February 2018, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Power, and other co-owners received 60-day notice of intent to sue letters from the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association concerning allegations of violations of new source review and permitting provisions of the Clean Air Act at the Independence and White Bluff coal-burning units, respectively.  In November 2018, following extensive negotiations, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Power entered a proposed settlement resolving those claims and reducing the risk that Entergy Arkansas, as operator of Independence and White Bluff, might be compelled under the Clean Air Act\u2019s regional haze program to install costly emissions control technologies.  Consistent with the terms of the settlement, Entergy Arkansas, along with co-owners, agreed to begin using only low-sulfur coal at Independence and White Bluff by mid-2021; agreed to cease using coal at White Bluff and Independence by the end of 2028 and 2030, respectively; agreed to cease operation of the remaining gas unit at Lake Catherine by the end of 2027; reserved the option to develop new generating sources at each plant site; and committed to installing or proposing to regulators at least 800 MWs of renewable generation by the end of 2027, with at least half installed or proposed by the end of 2022 (which includes two existing Entergy Arkansas projects) and with all qualifying co-owner projects counting toward satisfaction of the obligation.  Under the settlement, the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association also waived certain potential existing claims under federal and state environmental law with respect to specified generating plants.  The settlement, which formally resolves a complaint filed by the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association, was subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  In November 2020 the court denied motions by the Arkansas Attorney General and the Arkansas Affordable Energy Coalition to intervene and to stay the proceedings.  The proposed intervenors did not appeal the ruling.  The District Court approved and entered the proposed settlement in March 2021.  Entergy met the settlement deadline to use low-sulfur coal and is on target to meet the other requirements of the settlement.  See \u201cRemaining Useful Lives Review\u201d in the \u201cState and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery\u201d section of Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries Management\u2019s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the APSC\u2019s proceeding related to Entergy Arkansas\u2019s utility generation units.  The second planning period (2018-2028) for the regional haze program requires states to examine sources for impacts on visibility and to prepare SIPs by July 31, 2021 to ensure reasonable progress is being made to attain  283 283 283 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  visibility improvements.  Entergy received information collection requests from the Arkansas and Louisiana Departments of Environmental Quality requesting an evaluation of technical and economic feasibility of various NOx and SO2 control technologies for Independence, Nelson 6, Nelson Industrial Steam Company (NISCO), and Ninemile.  Responses to the information collection requests have been submitted to the respective state agencies.  Louisiana has issued its draft SIP which, at this time, does not propose any additional air emissions controls for the affected Entergy units in Louisiana.  Some public commenters, however, believe additional air controls are cost-effective.  It is not yet clear how the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) will respond in its final SIP, and the agency, like many other state agencies, did not meet the July 31, 2021 deadline to submit a SIP to the EPA for review.  Similar to the LDEQ, the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment, Division of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) did not meet the July 31, 2021 SIP submission deadline, but subsequently submitted it to the EPA for review.  The ADEQ reviewed Entergy\u2019s Independence plant, but determined that additional air emission controls would not be cost-effective considering the facility\u2019s commitment to cease coal-fired combustion by December 31, 2030.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has completed its second-planning period SIP and submitted it to the EPA for review.  There were no Entergy sources selected for additional emission controls.  The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality continues to develop its SIP, but there are no Entergy sources that are expected to be impacted.  In August 2022 the EPA issued findings of failure to submit regional haze SIPs to 15 states, including Louisiana and Mississippi.  These findings were effective September 2022 and start the two-year period for the EPA to either approve a SIP submitted by the state or issue a final federal plan.  Greenhouse Gas Emissions  In July 2019 the EPA released the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE), which applies only to existing coal-fired electric generating units.  The ACE determines that heat rate improvements are the best system of emission reductions and lists six candidate technologies for consideration by states at each coal unit.  The rule and associated rulemakings by the EPA replace the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which established national emissions performance rates for existing fossil-fuel fired steam electric generating units and combustion turbines.  The ACE rule provides states discretion in determining how the best system for emission reductions applies to individual units, including through the consideration of technical feasibility and the remaining useful life of the facility.  The ADEQ and the LDEQ have issued information collection requests to Entergy facilities to help the states collect the information needed to determine the best system of emission reductions for each facility.  Entergy responded to the requests.  In January 2021 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated ACE.  The court held that ACE relied on an incorrect interpretation of the Clean Air Act that the statute expressly forecloses emission reduction approaches, such as emissions trading and generating shifting, that cannot be applied at and to the individual source.  The court remanded ACE to the EPA for further consideration and also vacated the repeal of the Clean Power Plan.  In March 2021 the D.C. Circuit issued a partial mandate vacating the ACE rule, but withheld the mandate vacating the repeal of the Clean Power Plan pending the EPA\u2019s new rulemaking to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.  Thus, there currently is no regulation in place with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from existing electric generating units and states are not expected to take further action to develop and submit plans at this time.  In October 2021 the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the already vacated ACE rule.  In June 2022 the United States Supreme Court held that the EPA could not use generation shifting as the best system of emission reduction under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.  The EPA does still have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, but those emissions reductions must be technology based.  The EPA has announced its intent to propose a rule for existing power plants pursuant to the Clean Air Act by March 2023.  The ultimate impact of the United States Supreme Court's decision cannot be determined at this time.  284 284 284 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  In April 2021, President Biden announced a target for the United States in connection with the United Nations\u2019 \u201cParis Agreement\u201d on climate change.  The target consists of a 50-52 percent reduction in economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030.  President Biden has also stated that a goal of his administration is for the electric power industry to decarbonize fully by 2035.  The details surrounding implementation of these targets are not finalized, and the impacts to Entergy of any potential related legislation cannot be predicted.  Entergy continues to support national legislation that would most efficiently reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions and increase planning certainty for electric utilities.\u00a0\u00a0By virtue of its proportionally large investment in low-emitting generation technologies, Entergy has a low overall carbon dioxide emission \u201cintensity,\u201d or rate of carbon dioxide emitted per megawatt-hour of electricity generated.\u00a0\u00a0In anticipation of the imposition of carbon dioxide emission limits on the electric industry, Entergy initiated actions designed to reduce its exposure to potential new governmental requirements related to carbon dioxide emissions.\u00a0\u00a0These voluntary actions included a formal program to stabilize owned power plant carbon dioxide emissions at 2000 levels through 2005, and Entergy succeeded in reducing emissions below 2000 levels.  In 2006, Entergy started including emissions from controllable power purchases in addition to its ownership share of generation and established a second formal voluntary program to stabilize power plant carbon dioxide emissions and emissions from controllable power purchases, cumulatively over the period, at 20% below 2000 levels through 2010.\u00a0\u00a0In 2011, Entergy extended this commitment through 2020, which it ultimately outperformed by approximately 8% both cumulatively and on an annual basis.\u00a0\u00a0In 2019, in connection with a climate scenario analysis following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures describing climate-related governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets, Entergy announced a 2030 carbon dioxide emission rate goal focused on a 50% reduction from Entergy\u2019s base year - 2000.  Entergy now anticipates achieving this reduction several years early.  In September 2020, Entergy announced a commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 inclusive of all businesses, all applicable gases, and all emission scopes.  In 2022, Entergy enhanced its commitment to include an interim goal of 50% carbon-free energy generating capacity by 2030 and expanded its interim emission rate goal to include all purchased power.  See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I Item 1A for discussion of the risks associated with achieving these climate goals.  Entergy\u2019s comprehensive, third-party verified greenhouse gas inventory and progress against its voluntary goals are published on its website.  Entergy participates in the M.J. Bradley & Associates\u2019 Annual Benchmarking Air Emissions Report, an annual analysis of the 100 largest U.S. electric power producers.  The report is available on the M.J. Bradley website.  Entergy participates annually in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and in 2022 was listed on the North American Index.  Entergy has been listed on the World or North American Index, or both, for 21 consecutive years.  Entergy also participated in the 2022 CDP Climate Change and CDP Water Security evaluations, receiving a \u2018B\u2019 for both responses.  Potential Legislative, Regulatory, and Judicial Developments  In addition to the specific instances described above, there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives that are under consideration at the federal, state, and local level.\u00a0\u00a0Because of the nature of Entergy\u2019s business, the imposition of any of these initiatives could affect Entergy\u2019s operations.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy continues to monitor these initiatives and activities in order to analyze their potential operational and cost implications.\u00a0\u00a0These initiatives include:  \u2022reconsideration and revision of ambient air quality standards downward which could lead to additional areas of nonattainment; \u2022designation by the EPA and state environmental agencies of areas that are not in attainment with national ambient air quality standards; \u2022introduction of bills in Congress and development of regulations by the EPA proposing further limits on SO2, mercury, carbon dioxide, and other air emissions.\u00a0\u00a0New legislation or regulations applicable to  285 285 285 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  stationary sources could take the form of market-based cap-and-trade programs, direct requirements for the installation of air emission controls onto air emission sources, or other or combined regulatory programs; \u2022efforts in Congress or at the EPA to establish a federal carbon dioxide emission tax, control structure, or unit performance standards; \u2022revisions to the estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon and its use for regulatory impact analysis of federal laws and regulations; \u2022implementation of the regional cap and trade programs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases; \u2022efforts on the local, state, and federal level to codify renewable portfolio standards, clean energy standards, or a similar mechanism requiring utilities to produce or purchase a certain percentage of their power from defined renewable energy sources or energy sources with lower emissions; \u2022efforts to develop more stringent state water quality standards, effluent limitations for Entergy\u2019s industry sector, stormwater runoff control regulations, and cooling water intake structure requirements; \u2022efforts to restrict the previously-approved continued use of oil-filled equipment containing certain levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); \u2022efforts by certain external groups to encourage reporting and disclosure of environmental, social, and governance risk; \u2022the listing of additional species as threatened or endangered, the protection of critical habitat for these species, and developments in the legal protection of eagles and migratory birds; \u2022the regulation of the management, disposal, and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals; and \u2022the regulation of the management and disposal and recycling of equipment associated with renewable and clean energy sources such as used solar panels, wind turbine blades, hydrogen usage, or battery storage.  Clean Water Act  The 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (known as the Clean Water Act) provide the statutory basis for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program, section 402, and the basic structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from point sources to waters of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0The Clean Water Act requires virtually all discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States to be permitted.\u00a0\u00a0Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regulates cooling water intake structures, section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires a water quality certification from the state in support of certain federal actions and approvals, and section 404 regulates the dredge and fill of waters of the United States, including jurisdictional wetlands.  Federal Jurisdiction of Waters of the United States  In June 2020 the EPA\u2019s revised definition of waters of the United States in the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR) became effective, narrowing the scope of Clean Water Act jurisdiction, as compared to a 2015 definition which had been stayed by several federal courts.  In August 2021 a federal district court vacated and remanded the NWPR for further consideration.  The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) subsequently issued a statement that the agencies would revert to pre-2015 regulations pending a new rulemaking.  In December 2022 the EPA and the Corps released a final definition of waters of the United States that replaces the NWPR with a definition that is consistent with the pre-2015 regulatory regime as interpreted by several United States Supreme Court decisions.  Most notably, the exclusion for waste treatment systems is retained.  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA to mandate clean-up by, or to collect reimbursement of clean-up costs from, owners or operators of sites at which hazardous substances may be or have been released.\u00a0\u00a0Certain private parties also may use CERCLA to recover response costs.\u00a0\u00a0Parties that transported hazardous substances to these sites or arranged for the disposal of the substances are also deemed liable by CERCLA.\u00a0\u00a0CERCLA has been interpreted to impose strict, joint, and several liability on responsible parties.\u00a0\u00a0Many states have adopted programs similar to CERCLA.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy subsidiaries in the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses have sent waste materials to various  286 286 286 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  disposal sites over the years, and releases have occurred at Entergy facilities including nuclear facilities that have been or will be sold to decommissioning companies.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, environmental laws now regulate certain of Entergy\u2019s operating procedures and maintenance practices that historically were not subject to regulation.\u00a0\u00a0Some disposal sites used by Entergy subsidiaries have been the subject of governmental action under CERCLA or similar state programs, resulting in site clean-up activities.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy subsidiaries have participated to various degrees in accordance with their respective potential liabilities in such site clean-ups and have developed experience with clean-up costs.\u00a0\u00a0The affected Entergy subsidiaries have established provisions for the liabilities for such environmental clean-up and restoration activities.\u00a0\u00a0Details of potentially material CERCLA and similar state program liabilities are discussed in the \u201cOther Environmental Matters\u201d section below.  Coal Combustion Residuals  In June 2010 the EPA issued a proposed rule on coal combustion residuals (CCRs) that contained two primary regulatory options: (1) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or received (including stored) in surface impoundments as so-called \u201cspecial wastes\u201d under the hazardous waste program of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C; or (2) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments as non-hazardous wastes under Subtitle D of RCRA.\u00a0\u00a0Under both options, CCRs that are beneficially reused in certain processes would remain excluded from hazardous waste regulation.  In April 2015 the EPA published the final CCR rule with the material being regulated under the second scenario presented above - as non-hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA Subtitle D.  The final regulations create new compliance requirements including modified storage, new notification and reporting practices, product disposal considerations, and CCR unit closure criteria.\u00a0\u00a0Entergy believes that on-site disposal options will be available at its facilities, to the extent needed for CCR that cannot be transferred for beneficial reuse.  As of December 31, 2022, Entergy has recorded asset retirement obligations related to CCR management of $27 million.  Pursuant to the EPA Rule, Entergy operates groundwater monitoring systems surrounding its coal combustion residual landfills located at White Bluff, Independence, and Nelson.  Monitoring to date has detected concentrations of certain listed constituents in the area, but has not indicated that these constituents originated at the active landfill cells.  Reporting has occurred as required, and detection monitoring will continue as the rule requires.  In late-2017, Entergy determined that certain in-ground wastewater treatment system recycle ponds at its White Bluff and Independence facilities require management under the new EPA regulations.  Consequently, in order to move away from using the recycle ponds, White Bluff and Independence each have installed a new permanent bottom ash handling system that does not fall under the CCR rule.  As of November 2020, both sites are operating the new system and no longer are sending waste to the recycle ponds.  Each site has commenced closure of its two recycle ponds (four ponds total), prior to the April 11, 2021 deadline under the finalized CCR rule for unlined recycle ponds.  Any potential requirements for corrective action or operational changes under the new CCR rule continue to be assessed.  Notably, ongoing litigation has resulted in the EPA\u2019s continuing review of the rule.  Consequently, the nature and cost of additional corrective action requirements may depend, in part, on the outcome of the EPA\u2019s review.  Other Environmental Matters  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas  The EPA notified Entergy that the EPA believes Entergy is a PRP concerning PCB contamination at the F.J. Doyle Salvage facility in Leonard, Texas.  The facility operated as a scrap salvage business during the 1970s to the 1990s.  In May 2018 the EPA investigated the site surface and sub-surface soils and, in November 2018 the EPA conducted a removal action, including disposal of PCB contaminated soils.  Entergy responded to the EPA\u2019s information requests in May and July 2019.  In November 2020 the EPA sent Entergy and other PRPs a demand letter seeking reimbursement for response costs totaling $4 million expended at the site.  Liability and PRP  287 287 287 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  allocation of response costs are yet to be determined.  In December 2020, Entergy responded to the demand letter, without admitting liability or waiving any rights, indicating that it would engage in good faith negotiations with the EPA with respect to the demand.  An initial meeting between the EPA and the PRPs took place in June 2021.  Negotiations between the PRPs and the EPA are ongoing.   Litigation  Entergy uses legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against it, but certain states in which Entergy operates have proven to be unusually litigious environments.\u00a0\u00a0Judges and juries in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases.\u00a0\u00a0The litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk to Entergy.  Asbestos Litigation\u00a0(Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)  See Note 8 to the financial statements for a discussion of this litigation.  Employment and Labor-related Proceedings (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)  See Note 8 to the financial statements for a discussion of these proceedings.   Human Capital  Employees  Employees are an integral part of Entergy\u2019s commitment to serving customers.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2022, Entergy subsidiaries employed 11,707 people.

Entergy focuses on an approach that includes, among other things, governance and oversight; safety; organizational health, including diversity, inclusion, and belonging; and talent management.  Governance and Oversight  Ensuring that workplace processes support the desired culture and strategy begins with the Board of Directors and the Office of the Chief Executive.  The Talent and Compensation Committee (formerly Personnel Committee) establishes priorities and each quarter reviews strategies and results on a range of topics covering the workforce, the workplace, and the marketplace.  It oversees Entergy\u2019s incentive plan design and administers its executive compensation plans to incentivize the behaviors and outcomes that support achievement of Entergy\u2019s corporate objectives.  Annually, it reviews executive performance, development, succession plans, and talent pipeline to align a high performing executive team with Entergy\u2019s priorities.  The Talent and Compensation Committee also oversees Entergy\u2019s performance through regular briefings on a wide variety of human resources topics including Entergy\u2019s safety culture and performance; organizational health; and diversity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives and performance.  The Talent and Compensation Committee\u2019s Charter was revised in 2021 to acknowledge the committee\u2019s responsibility for overseeing and monitoring the effectiveness of Entergy\u2019s human capital strategies, including its workforce diversity, inclusion, and organizational health and safety strategies, programs, and initiatives.  In recognition of the importance that organizational health and diversity, inclusion, and belonging play in enabling Entergy to achieve its business strategies, the committee receives periodic reports on Entergy\u2019s organization health and diversity, inclusion, and belonging programs, strategies, and performance, including briefings at each of its regular meetings.  The committee also receives updates on Entergy\u2019s performance to date on key workforce, workplace, and marketplace measures, including progress in the representation of women and underrepresented minorities, both in the total workforce and in director level and above placements, progress in key diversity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives and diverse supplier spend.  Other committees of the Board oversee other key aspects of Entergy\u2019s culture.  For example, the Audit Committee reviews reports on enterprise risks, ethics, and compliance training and performance, as well as regular reports on calls made to Entergy\u2019s ethics line and related investigations.  To maximize the sharing of information and facilitate the participation of all Board members in these discussions, the Board schedules its regular committee meetings in a manner such that all directors can attend.  289 289 289 Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  The Office of the Chief Executive, which includes the Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, ensures annual business plans are designed to support Entergy\u2019s talent objectives, reviews workforce-related metrics, and regularly discusses the development, succession planning, and performance of their direct reports and other company officers.  Safety  Entergy\u2019s safety objective is: Everyone Safe.  All Day.  Every Day.  The continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and another historic hurricane season presented significant challenges.  Entergy employees achieved a total recordable incident rate of 0.51 in 2022, compared to 0.46 in 2021, and 0.40 in 2020.  The results of 2021 unfortunately included an employee fatality.  Entergy has enhanced dramatically leadership efforts and field presence to further its objective of zero fatalities, which it achieved in 2022.  Also in 2022, there was a significant decrease in the number of serious injuries.  The recordable incident rate equals the number of recordable incidents per 100 full-time equivalents.  Recordable incidents include fatalities, lost-time accidents, restricted-duty accidents, and medical attentions and is not inclusive of potential work-related COVID-19 cases.  Organizational Health, including Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIB)  Entergy believes that organizational health fosters an engaged and productive culture that positions Entergy to deliver sustainable value to its stakeholders.  Entergy measures its progress through an organizational health survey coordinated by an external third party.  Since initially administering the survey in 2014, Entergy improved from an initial score of 49 (fourth quartile) to a score in 2020 of 72 (second quartile), in 2021 of 63 (third quartile), and in 2022 of 61 (third quartile).  Although the score declined slightly in 2022 as compared to 2021, it improved from the 2014 baseline.  Management uses the results of the annual survey to design and implement strategies to positively influence organizational health.  Initial employee participation of 66 percent in 2014 rose to and remains at approximately 90 percent in 2019-2022.  Entergy believes that creating a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging drives foundational engagement.  Entergy is committed to developing and retaining a workforce that reflects the rich diversity of the communities it serves.  In 2019, Entergy embarked on a three-year phased approach to enhance inclusion for individuals and teams.  In 2022, Entergy continued to focus its actions to engage a diverse workforce, infusing DIB into hiring policies, practices and procedures, aligning Employee Resource Group goals to DIB goals, growing its DIB Champion network, integrating DIB into Entergy\u2019s leadership development programs, and facilitating training from the executive leadership ranks down to the frontline.  Through these efforts, Entergy aspires to create greater understanding and accountability regarding the behaviors and outcomes that are indicative of a premier utility.  Talent Management  Entergy\u2019s focus on talent management is organized in three areas: developing and attracting a diverse pool of talent, equipping its leaders to develop the organization, and building premier utility capability through employee performance management and succession programs.  Entergy believes that developing a diverse pool of local talent equipped with the skills needed, today and in the future, and reflecting the communities Entergy serves will give it a long-term competitive advantage.  The focus of Entergy\u2019s leadership development programs is to equip managers with the skills needed to effectively develop their teams and improve the leader-employee relationship.  Entergy\u2019s talent development infrastructure, which includes a combination of business function-specific and enterprise-wide learning and development programs, is designed to ensure Entergy has qualified staff with the skills, experiences, and behaviors needed to perform today and prepare for the future.  Entergy strives to achieve its strategic priorities by aligning and enhancing team and individual performance with business objectives, effectively deploying talent through succession planning, and managing workforce transitions.  290 290 290  Table of ContentsPart I Item 1Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy  Availability of SEC filings and other information on Entergy\u2019s website  Entergy electronically files reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form\u00a010-K, quarterly reports on Form\u00a010-Q, current reports on Form\u00a08-K, proxies, and amendments to such reports.
