BUSINESS     General Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries, referred to throughout this document as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cHumana,\u201d is a leading health and well-being company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health. Our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well\u2010being and lower costs. Our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. To accomplish that, we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients, our members. Our range of clinical capabilities, resources and tools, such as in\u2010home care, behavioral health, pharmacy services, data analytics and wellness solutions, combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective.   As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 17 million members in our medical benefit plans, as well as approximately 5\u00a0million members in our specialty products. During 2022, 82% of our total premiums and services revenue were derived from contracts with the federal government, including 14% derived from our individual Medicare Advantage contracts in Florida with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, under which we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 771,900 members as of December\u00a031, 2022. Humana Inc. was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1964. Our principal executive offices are located at 500 West Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, the telephone number at that address is (502)\u00a0580-1000, and our website address is www.humana.com. We have made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our web site our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section\u00a013(a) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. This Annual Report on Form 10-K, or 2022 Form 10-K, contains both historical and forward-looking information. See Item\u00a01A. \u2013 Risk Factors in this 2022 Form 10-K for a description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business.     4 4 4   Business Segments During December 2022, we realigned our businesses into two distinct segments: Insurance and CenterWell. The Insurance segment includes the businesses that were previously included in the Retail and Group and Specialty segments, as well as the Pharmacy Benefit Manager, or PBM, business which was previously included in the Healthcare Services segment. The CenterWell segment (formerly Healthcare Services) represents our payor-agnostic healthcare services offerings, including pharmacy dispensing services, provider services, and home services. In addition to the new segment classifications being utilized to assess performance and allocate resources, we believe this simpler structure will create greater collaboration across the Insurance and CenterWell businesses and will accelerate work that is underway to centralize and integrate operations within the organization. Prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2022 presentation. For a recast of prior period segment financial information, refer to Note 18 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K. Our  two reportable segments, Insurance and CenterWell, are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, to assess performance and allocate resources. For additional information on our business segments and segment financial information, refer to Note 18 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Our Products Our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted. These products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage. Health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, include comprehensive managed care benefits generally through a participating network of physicians, hospitals, and other providers. Preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, provide members the freedom to choose any health care provider. However, PPOs generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider\u2019s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the PPO\u2019s network. Point of Service, or POS, plans combine the advantages of HMO plans with the flexibility of PPO plans. In general, POS plans allow members to choose, at the time medical services are needed, to seek care from a provider within the plan\u2019s network or outside the network. In addition, we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness, including pharmacy, provider services, and home solutions, as well as services and capabilities to advance population health. At the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us, engaging members in clinical programs, and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service, or FFS, to a value-based arrangement. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. The discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments.  5 5 5    Our Insurance Segment Products The Insurance segment is comprised of products serving Medicare and state-based contract beneficiaries sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans. This segment also includes products consisting of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision and life insurance benefits, as well as administrative services only, or ASO.  In addition, our Insurance segment includes our military services business as well as the operations of our PBM business. These products are described in the discussion that follows.   The following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the Insurance segment by product for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022: Insurance SegmentPremiums andServices\u00a0RevenuePercent ofConsolidatedPremiums andServices\u00a0Revenue\u00a0(dollars in millions)Premiums:Individual Medicare Advantage$65,591\u00a070.9\u00a0%Group Medicare Advantage7,297\u00a07.9\u00a0%Medicare stand-alone PDP2,269\u00a02.5\u00a0%Total Medicare75,157\u00a081.3\u00a0%Medicare Supplement743\u00a00.8\u00a0%Commercial fully-insured3,733\u00a04.0\u00a0%Total fully-insured4,476\u00a04.8\u00a0%Medicaid and other6,376\u00a06.9\u00a0%Specialty1,703\u00a01.8\u00a0%Total premiums87,712\u00a094.8\u00a0%Services850\u00a00.9\u00a0%Total premiums and services revenue$88,562\u00a095.8\u00a0%  Medicare We have participated in the Medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence, offering at least one type of Medicare plan in all 50 states. We have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of PPO and HMO providers. We employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide Medicare beneficiaries in making cost-effective decisions with respect to their health care. We believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes. Medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits. CMS, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, administers the Medicare program. Hospitalization benefits are provided under Part A, without the payment of any premium, for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days. Eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under Part B. Beneficiaries eligible for Part A and Part B coverage under traditional fee-for-service Medicare are still required to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Throughout this document this program is referred to as Medicare FFS. As an alternative to Medicare FFS, in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with CMS pursuant to the Medicare Advantage program, Medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a Medicare Advantage organization under Medicare Part C. Pursuant to Medicare Part C, Medicare Advantage organizations contract with CMS to offer Medicare Advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under Medicare FFS. Our Medicare  6 6 6   Advantage, or MA, plans are discussed in the following sections. Prescription drug benefits are provided under Part D. Individual Medicare Advantage Products We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits, including wellness programs, chronic care management, and care coordination, to Medicare eligible persons under HMO, PPO, Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, and Special Needs Plans, including Dual Eligible Special Needs, or D-SNP, plans in exchange for contractual payments received from CMS, usually a fixed payment per member per month. With each of these products, the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of Medicare FFS, typically including reduced cost sharing, enhanced prescription drug benefits, care coordination, data analysis techniques to help identify member needs, complex case management, tools to guide members in their health care decisions, care management programs, wellness and prevention programs and, in some instances, a reduced monthly Part B premium. Most Medicare Advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under Part D as part of the basic plan, subject to cost sharing and other limitations. Accordingly, all of the provisions of the Medicare Part D program described in connection with our stand-alone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for Medicare-covered services or for certain extra benefits. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between October\u00a015 and December\u00a07 for coverage that begins on the following January\u00a01. Our Medicare HMO and PPO plans, which cover Medicare-eligible individuals residing in certain counties, may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating in-network providers or in emergency situations. Except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan, most HMO plans provide no out-of-network benefits. PPO plans carry an out-of network benefit that is subject to higher member cost-sharing. In some cases, these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the HMO or PPO plan in addition to the monthly Part B premium they are required to pay the Medicare program. Most of our Medicare PFFS plans are network-based products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that Medicare Advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans. In these areas, we offer Medicare PFFS plans that have no preferred network. Individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical Medicare Advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to Medicare FFS payment rates. CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health status of covered members. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more where a plan's membership has higher expected costs. Under this model, rates paid to MA plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard Medicare-covered benefits to an enrollee with a \"national average risk profile.\" That baseline payment amount is adjusted to account for certain demographic characteristics and health status of our enrolled members. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses the diagnosis data, collected from providers, to calculate the health status-related risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans, which CMS further adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government fee-for-service (FFS) program. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our health status-adjusted payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. In addition, we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts, to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model. For additional information, refer to Note 17 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K. 7 7 7   At December\u00a031, 2022, we provided health insurance coverage under CMS contracts to approximately 4,565,600 individual Medicare Advantage members, including approximately 771,900 members in Florida. These Florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately $13.2 billion, which represented approximately 20% of our individual Medicare Advantage premiums revenue, or 14% of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022. Our individual Medicare Advantage products covered under Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May\u00a01 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare Advantage products have been renewed for 2023, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2023 have been approved. Individual Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Products We offer stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under Medicare Part D, including a PDP offering co-branded with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., or the Humana-Walmart plan. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between October\u00a015 and December\u00a07 for coverage that begins on the following January\u00a01. Our stand-alone PDP offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by Congress, as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of out-of-pocket costs for premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance. Our revenues from CMS and the beneficiary are determined from our PDP bids submitted annually to CMS. These revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item\u00a08. \u2013 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, titled \u201cMedicare Part D.\u201d Our stand-alone PDP contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May\u00a01 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare stand-alone PDP products have been renewed for 2023, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2023 have been approved. We have administered CMS\u2019s Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program since 2010. This program allows individuals who receive Medicare\u2019s low-income subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan. CMS temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both Medicare and Medicaid into the LI-NET prescription drug plan program, and subsequently transitions each member into a Medicare Part D plan that may or may not be a Humana Medicare plan. Group Medicare Advantage and Medicare Stand-Alone PDP We offer products that enable employers that provide post-retirement health care benefits to replace Medicare wrap or Medicare supplement products with Medicare Advantage or stand-alone PDPs from Humana. These products are primarily offered as PPO plans on the same Medicare platform as individual Medicare Advantage plans. These plans offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual Medicare plans discussed previously, however, group Medicare Advantage plans typically have richer benefit offerings than individual Medicare Advantage plans, including prescription drug coverage in the gap, for instance, due to the desire of many customers to closely match their pre-retirement benefit structure.  Medicare Supplement We also offer Medicare supplement products that help pay the medical expenses that Medicare FFS does not cover, such as copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. 8 8 8   State-based Medicaid Contracts Through our state-based contracts, we serve members enrolled in Medicaid, a program funded by both the federal and state governments and administered by states to care for their most vulnerable populations. Within federal guidelines, states determine whom to cover, but general categories for traditional Medicaid programs include: children and parents receiving assistance through Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); Aged, Blind, and Disabled (ABD) individuals; and Medicaid Expansion adults. Through Medicaid Managed Long-Term Support Services (MLTSS) programs, states offer programs to deliver support services to people who receive home and community or institution-based services for long-term care.  We have contracts in multiple states to serve Medicaid-eligible members, including Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The Louisiana contract was effective January 1, 2023.  We also serve members who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare, referred to as \"dual eligible\", through our Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and stand-alone prescription drug plans. As the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of costs, Humana is participating in varied integration models designed to improve health outcomes and reduce avoidable costs. These programs largely operate separately from traditional Medicaid programs. We currently serve dual eligible members under CMS\u2019s dual eligible demonstration program in Illinois. As part of our individual Medicare Advantage products, we also offer Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNP). In connection with offering a D-SNP in a particular state, we are required to enter into a special coordinating contract with the applicable state Medicaid agency. To meet federal requirements that took effect in 2021, states have begun to implement new D-SNP requirements to strengthen Medicaid-Medicare integration requirements for D-SNPs. Some states are also moving to support the dual eligible population by linking D-SNP participation to enrollment in a plan that also participates in a state-based Medicaid program to coordinate and integrate both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.  Group Commercial Coverage   Our commercial products sold to employer groups include a broad spectrum of major medical benefits with multiple in-network coinsurance levels and annual deductible choices that employers of all sizes can offer to their employees on either a fully-insured, through HMO, PPO, or POS plans, or self-funded basis. Our plans integrate clinical programs, plan designs, communication tools, and spending accounts.   Our ASO products are offered to small group and large group employers who self-insure their employee health plans. We receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded employers. These products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully-insured HMO, PPO, or POS products described previously. Under ASO contracts, self-funded employers generally retain the risk of financing the costs of health benefits, with large group customers retaining a greater share and small group customers a smaller share of the cost of health benefits.\u00a0 All small group ASO customers and many large group ASO customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs. Employers can customize their offerings with optional benefits such as dental, vision, and life products. We also offer optional benefits such as dental and vision to individuals. Military Services Under our TRICARE contracts with the United States Department of Defense, or DoD, we provide administrative services to arrange health care services for the dependents of active duty military personnel and for retired military personnel and their dependents. We have participated in the TRICARE program since 1996 under contracts with the DoD. Under our contracts, we provide administrative services while the federal government retains all of the risk of the cost of health benefits. Accordingly, we account for revenues under the current contract net of estimated health care costs similar to an administrative services fee only agreement.  9 9 9   On January 1, 2018, we began to deliver services under the T2017 East Region contract. The T2017 East Region contract comprises 32 states and approximately 6 million TRICARE beneficiaries. The T2017 East Region contract, which was originally set to expire on December 31, 2022, was subsequently extended by the DoD and is currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2023, unless further extended.    In December 2022, we were awarded the next generation of TRICARE Managed Care Support Contracts, or T-5, for the TRICARE East Region by the Defense Health Agency of the DoD. The contract is expected to go into effect in 2024. Until then the T2017 contract remains in place. Under the terms of the award, our service area covers approximately 4.6\u00a0million beneficiaries in a region consisting of 24 states and Washington, D.C. The length of the contract is one base year with eight annual option periods, which, if all options are exercised, would result in a total contract length of nine years.    Our CenterWell Segment Products The products offered by our CenterWell segment are key to our integrated care delivery model. This segment includes our pharmacy, provider services, and home solutions operations. The CenterWell segment also includes our strategic partnerships with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, or WCAS, to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers, as well as our minority ownership interest in hospice operations. Services offered by this segment are designed to enhance the overall healthcare experience. These services may lead to lower utilization associated with improved member health and/or lower drug costs. For information on our intersegment revenues, refer to Note 18 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.

PCO operates these clinics primarily under the Conviva Care Centers and CenterWell Senior Primary Care brands. Our primary care subsidiaries operate our medical center business through both employed physicians and care providers, and through third party management service organizations with whom we contract to arrange for and manage certain clinical services. PCO currently operates 235 primary care clinics and employs approximately 670 primary care providers. PCO serves approximately 247,900 patients, primarily under risk sharing arrangements with Humana Medicare Advantage health plans, third party Medicare Advantage health plans and CMS administered risk sharing arrangements for Medicare FFS.  \u00a0PCO also operates a Medical Services Organization, or MSO, through Conviva that coordinates medical care for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in Florida and Texas. This MSO provides resources in care coordination, financial risk management, clinical integration and patient engagement that help physicians improve the patient experience as well as care outcomes. Conviva\u2019s MSO collaborates with physicians, medical groups and integrated delivery systems to successfully transition to value-based care by engaging, partnering and offering practical services and solutions.  In 2020, our Primary Care Organization entered into a strategic partnership with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, or WCAS, to accelerate the expansion of our primary care model. In May 2022, we established a second strategic partnership with WCAS to develop additional centers between 2023 and 2025. As of December 31, 2022, there were 50 primary care clinics operating under the partnership and we intend to open approximately 100 additional primary care clinics in future periods under the existing arrangements. For additional information, refer to Note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K. Home Solutions  CenterWell Home Health We are actively involved in the care management of our customers with the greatest needs via in-home care. On August 17, 2021, we fully acquired Kindred at Home, or KAH, the nation\u2019s largest home health and hospice provider with locations in 40 states, providing extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65% overlap with our individual Medicare Advantage membership. Our home solutions geographic scale and clinical breadth provides the opportunity to offer care beyond our health plan members. We have fully-integrated the home health operations, now branded CenterWell Home Health, allowing us to accelerate clinical innovation and the development and roll out of a value-based operating model at scale, more closely aligning incentives to focus on improving patient outcomes and reducing the total cost of care. This is critical to deploying a value-based, advanced home health model at scale that makes it easier for patients and providers to benefit from our full continuum of home-based capabilities, leveraging the best channel to deliver the right care needed at the right time. Onehome Onehome serves as the convener for the value-based model meeting the needs of health plans by serving their members through a full-risk model for integrated home-based services. Onehome manages a full range of post-acute patient needs, integrating and coordinating with physicians, hospitals and health plans for the provision of home health and infusion services as well as the distribution of durable medical equipment, or DME, at patients\u2019 homes. Onehome served 15% of our MA members with our value-based model as of December 31, 2022.   Hospice Hospice care is an important offering in the full continuum of care we offer patients, and we have been successful in delivering the desired patient experience and outcomes through partnership models, including through participation in the CMS hospice Value-Based Insurance Design, or VBID, model. As such, on August\u00a011, 2022, we completed the sale of a 60% interest in Humana\u2019s Kindred at Home Hospice subsidiary, or KAH Hospice, to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, or CD&R.

These ancillary services and facilities include laboratories, ambulance services, medical equipment services, home health agencies, mental health providers, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, optical services, and pharmacies. Our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers. We use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members. These techniques include the coordination of care for our members, product and benefit designs, hospital inpatient management systems, the use of sophisticated analytics, and enrolling members into various care management programs. The focal point for health care services in many of our HMO networks is the primary care provider who, under contract with us, provides services to our members, and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers. Some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met. We have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions  12 12 12   such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease. We also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care, asthma related illness, end stage renal disease, diabetes, cancer, and certain other conditions. We typically contract with hospitals on either (1)\u00a0a per diem rate, which is an all-inclusive rate per day, (2)\u00a0a case rate for diagnosis-related groups (DRG), which is an all-inclusive rate per admission, or (3)\u00a0a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service, ambulatory payment classifications, or APCs, or at a discounted charge. APCs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment. These contracts are often multi-year agreements, with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index, other nationally recognized inflation indexes, or specific negotiations with the provider. Outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the Medicare allowable fee schedule. Our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year, unless either party gives written notice, generally ranging from 90 to 120 days, to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement. Most of the physicians in our PPO networks and some of our physicians in our HMO networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule, which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard Medicare allowable fee schedule. The terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between Medicare and commercial business. A significant portion of our Medicare network contracts, including those with both hospitals and physicians, are tied to Medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies.   Capitation We offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. These include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. For some of our medical membership, we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership, primarily HMO membership. Under the typical capitation arrangement, we prepay these providers a monthly fixed-fee per member, known as a capitation (per capita) payment, to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member. We believe these value-based arrangements represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy. Our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these value-based arrangements with third party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries. At December\u00a031, 2022, approximately 1,850,500 members, or 10.8% of our medical membership, were covered under shared risk value-based arrangements, which provide all member benefits, including 1,563,700 individual Medicare Advantage members, or 34.2% of our total individual Medicare Advantage membership.  Physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician\u2019s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis. We typically process all claims and measure the financial performance of our capitated providers and require guarantees in certain instances.\u00a0However, we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 250,900 HMO members, including 246,100 individual Medicare Advantage members, or 15.7% of the 1,563,700 individual Medicare Advantage members covered under value-based contracts at December\u00a031, 2022, with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members\u2019 health care benefits.\u00a0Capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the underlying claims experience was approximately $3.0 billion, or 3.9% of total benefits expense, for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022. We remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services.  13 13 13    Accreditation Assessment Our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs, including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards. We also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, which is used by employers, government purchasers and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) to evaluate health plans based on various criteria, including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction. Providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria, including licensing, patient access, office standards, after-hours coverage, and other factors. Most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by CMS and/or The Joint Commission. Recredentialing of participating providers occurs every three years, unless otherwise required by state or federal regulations. Recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses, review of their malpractice liability claims histories, review of their board certifications, if applicable, and review of applicable quality information. A committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing. We maintain accreditation for certain of our health plans and/or departments from NCQA, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), and/or URAC. Certain commercial businesses, such as those impacted by a third-party labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer, may require or prefer accredited health plans. NCQA reviews our compliance based on standards for quality improvement, population health management, credentialing, utilization management, network management, and member experience. We have achieved and maintained NCQA accreditation in many of our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid markets for HMO, POS, and PPO products, and our wellness program, Go365. Humana\u2019s pharmacy organization is accredited by URAC.   Sales and Marketing We use various methods to market our products, including television, radio, the Internet, telemarketing, and direct mailings. At December\u00a031, 2022, we employed approximately 1,400 sales representatives, as well as approximately 1,900 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of Medicare products, including Medicare Advantage and PDP, and specialty products in our Insurance segment, including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members. We have a marketing arrangement with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., or Wal-Mart, for our individual Medicare stand-alone PDP offering. We also sell group Medicare Advantage products through large employers. In addition, we market our Medicare and individual specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents. For our Medicare products, commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure, regulated in structure and amount by CMS. For our individual specialty products, we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums, with commissions varying by market and premium volume. In addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers, we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics. These include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products. We also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers. In our Insurance segment, individuals may become members of our commercial HMOs and PPOs through their employers or other groups, which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products, pay for all or part of the premiums, and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees. We attempt to become an employer\u2019s or group\u2019s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of HMO, PPO, and specialty products that provide cost-effective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members. We use licensed independent brokers, independent agents, digital insurance agencies, and employees to sell our group products. Many of our larger employer group customers are  14 14 14   represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products. We pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our specialty products.   Underwriting Since 2014, the Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we collectively refer to as the Health Care Reform Law, requires certain group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without pre-existing condition exclusions or health-status rating adjustments. Accordingly, certain group health plans are not subject to underwriting. Further, underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our individual Medicare, military services, or Medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or medical history.   Competition The health benefits industry is highly competitive. Our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies, national insurance companies, and other HMOs and PPOs. Many of our competitors have a larger membership base and/or greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete. Our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in Item\u00a01A. \u2013 Risk Factors in this 2022 Form 10-K.   Government Regulation Diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation\u2019s health care system, including the Health Care Reform Law at the federal level and laws in certain states limiting the entry of new providers or services though a certificate of need, or CON, process.  Our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business. We are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted, what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed, when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. For a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas, see Item\u00a01A. \u2013 Risk Factors in this 2022 Form 10-K.   Certain Other Services Captive Insurance Company We bear general business risks associated with operating our Company such as professional and general liability, employee workers\u2019 compensation, cybersecurity, and officer and director errors and omissions risks. Professional and general liability risks may include, for example, medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage. We retain certain of these risks through our wholly-owned, captive insurance subsidiary. We reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third-party insurance companies. We remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses. Centralized Intercompany Services We provide centralized intercompany services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers. These services include management information systems, product development and administration, finance, human resources, accounting, law, public relations, marketing, insurance, purchasing, risk management, internal audit, actuarial, underwriting, claims processing, billing/enrollment, and customer service.  15 15 15   Through intercompany service agreements approved, if required, by state regulatory authorities, Humana Inc., our parent company, charges a services fee for reimbursement of certain centralized services provided to its subsidiaries to the extent that Humana Inc. is the service provider.   Human Capital Management  Our associates are essential to our success in delivering on our core strategy, and creating positive healthcare experiences for our members. We are committed to recruiting, developing, and retaining strong, diverse teams, actively promoting a culture of inclusion and diversity. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 67,100 associates.  Our Culture We believe that our members\u2019 experience is linked to our associates\u2019 experience and that engaged, productive associates are the key to building a healthy company and a caring environment where our associates go above and beyond for our members, driving innovation, and offering fulfilling experiences that incentivizes them to stay with us over the long-term. We provide opportunities for our associates to add to their personal well-being experiences that go beyond health to enhance their individual need for purpose, belonging and security. We regularly measure our success and opportunities to advance engagement through methods like a third-party administered Associate Experience Survey and continuous listening campaigns. Continuous listening involves our proactive solicitation, analysis and response to associate feedback. Pulse surveys are sent to associates throughout the year to get feedback on how we\u2019re doing, allowing us to assess our approach to work and act when needed. We believe this helps to strengthen our culture and support associate engagement. We also provide survey results to our entire associate population and encourage leaders to use the information to create open, honest action plans with their teams to build upon and further deepen our collective engagement. Our culture is further strengthened by optimizing the well-being and effectiveness of our workforce. Through alternative work styles, we help associates work more productively, communicate more easily and collaborate more freely. Alternate work styles enable associates to work from a job-appropriate location of their choice for all or some portion of their work schedule and to create a work schedule that better fits the diverse demands of today\u2019s work environment. When managed effectively, alternative work styles can enhance a company\u2019s employment brand, foster the development and effective delivery of innovative and diverse business solutions, right-size a company\u2019s energy-consumption footprint, and increase associate engagement and well-being.  Similar to many companies, we experienced lower engagement and higher turnover in 2022 and 2021 than in prior years. Our associate voluntary turnover rate, or VTR, for 2022 was 17.0%, up from 15.1% in 2021. However, associate engagement and well-being rates remained higher than average, despite challenges posed by the Great Resignation, COVID-19 and workforce optimization efforts to fulfill our commitment to execute on our value creation initiative to allow for increased investment in our Medicare Advantage benefits and healthcare services capabilities.   Inclusion and Diversity  Our Office of Inclusion & Diversity, or I&D Office, efforts are led by our Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Administrative Officer. The I&D Office connects to business groups across the enterprise to cultivate a diverse and inclusive culture that is representative of the communities we serve. By prioritizing I&D across our business, we enable associates to bring their whole selves to work, while also driving the innovation and insights needed to better serve our diverse members and communities. We strive to accelerate our culture of inclusion to build deep relationships and create simple, personalized experiences for all of our stakeholders. To help integrate inclusion and diversity into the fabric of the organization from the top down, the Executive Inclusion & Diversity Council is led by our President and CEO, with top priorities consisting of (i) leading and informing the strategy to drive the hiring, development, promotion and retention of our full diverse workforce; (ii) creating and maintaining an inclusive culture; (iii) reviewing our supply base and spend for diversification  16 16 16   opportunities; and (iv) improving transparency and accountability to sustain outcomes. We are committed to having balanced diversity at all levels and have developed a pathway for diverse talent within our recruiting initiatives. We\u2019ve also incorporated balanced interview panels into our interview process, through which we strategically engage a broad spectrum of interviewers that bring greater diversity and perspective. This proven best practice strengthens the candidate experience and hiring of diverse talent, ensuring we get the right talent for any given role, and minimizes the potential for personal blind spots when evaluating candidates.   Our inclusion and diversity objectives also aim to build an awareness of biases and beliefs, identify differences and similarities of our multi-generational workforce and enable associates to leverage differences to drive innovation and create value. We are committed to growing our associates\u2019 inclusion skills and diversity knowledge and provide a variety of associate training programs and workshop opportunities in areas of unconscious bias, disability awareness, cultural competency, racial equity, and social justice, among others. It is also our fundamental belief that every person has the right to a safe workplace. This includes having freedom of gender identity and expression, which we have included within our non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies.   Our associates\u2019 vast experiences and perceptions, unique characteristics, backgrounds and beliefs, drive the groundbreaking, strategic thinking that gives our Company its competitive edge in a diverse marketplace. Our approach fosters innovative thinking and creativity, expands insights and generates better business outcomes.  Pay and Benefits Philosophy, Compensation and Financial Security We believe all of our associates have the right to receive a fair living wage and we are committed to maintaining a pay and benefits philosophy that is market-based and recognizes an associate\u2019s contributions so that we can attract and retain an engaged, talented team. Our Company\u2019s pay and benefits structure is designed to motivate, incentivize and reward our associates - at all levels of the organization - for their skill development, demonstration of our values and performance. While our programs vary by location, associate type and business, they generally include: FinancialHealthLifeCompetitive Base PayMedical, Dental and Vision BenefitsPaid Time Off, Paid Holidays, Paid Volunteer Time Off and Jury Duty PayAssociate Incentive Plan (Annual Bonus)Supplemental Health BenefitsAdoption AssistanceSupplemental Pay (Including Overtime)Long-term Care InsurancePaid Parental Leave Program (6 weeks)Recognition Pay and Service AwardsWellness and Rewards ProgramPaid Caregiver Time Off Program (2 weeks)401(k) Retirement Savings Plan with Company Match ProgramHealth Plan IncentivesEmployee Assistance ProgramLife InsuranceOn-site Health and Fitness CentersAssociate Discount Programs and ServicesShort- and Long-Term Disability InsuranceOn-site Health Screenings and VaccinationsHelping Hands ProgramTuition Assistance ProgramTransit Services Financial Health Life Competitive Base Pay Medical, Dental and Vision Benefits Paid Time Off, Paid Holidays, Paid Volunteer Time Off and Jury Duty Pay Associate Incentive Plan (Annual Bonus) Supplemental Health Benefits Adoption Assistance Supplemental Pay (Including Overtime) Long-term Care Insurance Paid Parental Leave Program (6 weeks) Recognition Pay and Service Awards Wellness and Rewards Program Paid Caregiver Time Off Program (2 weeks) 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan with Company Match Program Health Plan Incentives Employee Assistance Program Life Insurance On-site Health and Fitness Centers Associate Discount Programs and Services Short- and Long-Term Disability Insurance On-site Health Screenings and Vaccinations Helping Hands Program Transit Services    17 17 17   Talent Development and Growth Opportunities We champion the individual goals and development of our associates, and provide a number of programs and resources to support their efforts. We provide opportunities for our associates to earn professional certifications through continued education programs and to participate in instructor-led and online courses designed to strengthen soft and hard-skills and enhance leadership development. Our Career Cultivation team sponsors workshops and events to promote associate accountability within their personal and professional growth as part of overall career development. Our associates are also encouraged to participate in mentoring programs with people of various backgrounds and cultures. We view mentoring as an essential development tool for sharing skills and knowledge so we can all succeed. Our commitment to mentoring feeds the successful future of our Company. Additionally, we utilize development programs to enhance talent within our organizations through targeted internal initiatives, where we aim to upskill and reskill existing associates for opportunities in new career pathways.
