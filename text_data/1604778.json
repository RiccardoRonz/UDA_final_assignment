We respect the IP rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third-party IP.  Patent applications are filed within the U.S. and in other strategic countries where we have a market presence.  On occasion, some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons, including rejections based on prior art.  We have approximately 2,250 patents that have expiration dates between 2023 and 2041.  We also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to use third-parties\u2019 patents.  In view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments\u2019 patenting processes, there is no guarantee that patented technology for our products and services will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted.  However, we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business, which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other IP right.  As we expand our products and offerings, we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products.  We periodically register federal trademarks, service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market.  We also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use.  Additionally, we rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that gives us a competitive advantage, including business strategies, unpatented inventions, designs, and process technology.  Such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information.
