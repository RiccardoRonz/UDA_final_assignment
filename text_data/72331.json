Item 1.\u00a0\u00a0Business  General Description of Business Nordson is an innovative precision technology company that leverages a scalable growth framework to deliver top tier growth with leading margins and returns. We engineer, manufacture and market differentiated products and systems used for precision dispensing, applying and controlling of adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces and various medical products such as: catheters, cannulas, medical balloons and medical tubing. These products are supported with extensive application expertise and direct global sales and service. We serve a wide variety of consumer non-durable, consumer durable and technology end markets including packaging, electronics, medical, appliances, energy, transportation, precision agriculture, building and construction, and general product assembly and finishing. Our strategy for long-term growth is based on solving customers\u2019 needs globally. We were incorporated in the State of Ohio in 1954 and are headquartered in Westlake, Ohio. Our products are marketed through a network of direct operations in more than 35 countries. Consistent with this global strategy, approximately 66 percent of our revenues were generated outside the United States in 2023. We have 7,900 employees worldwide. Our principal manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. ARAG Acquisition On August 24, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of the ARAG Group and its subsidiaries (\"ARAG Group\" or \"ARAG\") pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2023, by and among the Company, its Italian subsidiary, Capvis Equity V LP (\"Capvis\"), DRIP Co-Investment (\"DRIP\"), and certain individuals (together with Capvis and DRIP, collectively, the \"Sellers\"). ARAG is a global market and innovation leader in the development, production and supply of precision control systems and smart fluid components for agricultural spraying. ARAG operates as a division of our Industrial Precision Solutions segment. In anticipation of the acquisition, the Company entered into a \u20ac760,000 senior unsecured term loan facility with a group of banks in August 2023 (the \u201c364-Day Term Loan Facility\u201d). The all-cash ARAG acquisition of approximately \u20ac957,000, net of the repayment of approximately \u20ac30,300 of debt of the acquired companies, was funded using borrowings under the 364-Day Term Loan Facility and the Company's revolving credit facility.   Corporate Purpose and Goals We strive to be a vital, self-renewing, worldwide organization that, within the framework of ethical behavior and enlightened citizenship, grows and produces wealth for our customers, employees, shareholders and communities. We operate for the purpose of creating balanced, long-term benefits for all of our constituencies. We focus on long-term growth and returns. Each quarter, we may not produce increased sales, net income, or earnings per share, or exceed the comparative prior year's quarter. When short-term swings occur, we do not intend to alter our foundational objectives in efforts to mitigate the impact of these temporary occurrences. In 2021, we launched the Ascend strategy, which is designed to deliver top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. Ascend is driven by three interconnected pillars: the NBS (\"Nordson Business System\") Next growth framework; Owner Mindset, our division-led organizational structure; and Winning Teams, our talent strategy. These three pillars are built upon the foundation of what makes Nordson special: our culture and our values.  The NBS Next growth framework, the heart of the Ascend strategy, uses data-based segmentation to identify our greatest opportunities for profitable growth and ensure we are investing our resources disproportionately in those areas. Using data in a consistent and disciplined way, leaders across the Company are defining their strategic business priorities.  We drive organic growth by continually introducing new products and technology, providing high levels of customer service and support, capturing rapidly expanding opportunities in emerging geographies, and leveraging existing technology into new  Nordson Corporation 4 Nordson Corporation 4 Nordson Corporation 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents applications. Additional growth comes through the acquisition of companies that have differentiated precision technology-based product portfolios, serve attractive high-growth end-markets applications and have a customer-centric business model. The primary goals of our acquisition strategy are to complement our current capabilities, diversify our business into new industry sectors with new customers and expand the scope of the solutions we can offer to our customers. We strive to provide genuine customer satisfaction \u2013 it is the foundation upon which we continue to build our business. Complementing our business strategy is the objective to provide opportunities for employee self-fulfillment, growth, security, recognition and equitable compensation. This goal is met through the Human Resources department\u2019s facilitation of employee training, leadership training and the creation of on-the-job growth opportunities. The result is a highly qualified and professional global team capable of meeting corporate objectives. For more information, see \"Human Capital Resources\" below. We recognize the value of employee participation in the planning process. Strategic and operating plans are developed by all divisions, resulting in a sense of ownership and commitment on the part of employees in accomplishing our objectives. We are an equal opportunity employer. At Nordson, we have a long and proud history of investing in the communities where we live and work. We are committed to contributing approximately five percent of domestic pretax earnings to education, human welfare services and other charitable activities, particularly in communities where we have significant operations. Through the Nordson Corporation Foundation (the \u201cFoundation\u201d), we give back by providing grants to nonprofits in communities where we have facilities employing approximately 100 people. In recent years, we have extended our reach internationally, with giving programs in 11 international locations. In 2022, we also expanded our Matching Gifts program internationally, which further expands our culture of giving around the world. Since 1989, we have donated more than $162 million to communities where we live and work. In addition, our employees volunteered more than 109,000 hours through our Time \u2018N Talent and Dollars for Doers programs.   Principal Products and Uses We are a diversified precision technology company that engineers, manufactures and markets differentiated products and systems used to dispense, apply and control adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, medical components, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces. Our precision technology can be found in manufacturing facilities around the world producing a wide range of goods for consumer durable, consumer non-durable, medical and technology end markets. Equipment ranges from single-use components to manual, stand-alone units for low-volume operations to microprocessor-based automated systems for high-speed, high-volume production lines. We market our products globally, primarily through a direct sales force, and also through qualified distributors and sales representatives.

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Other Resources  Our production operations include machining, molding and assembly. We manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment. Many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models. We have principal manufacturing operations and sources of supply in the United States in Ohio, Georgia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota,  Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Wisconsin; as well as in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics, typically in sheets, bar stock, castings, forgings, tubing and pellets. We also purchase many electrical and electronic components, fabricated metal parts, high-pressure fluid hoses, packings, seals and other items integral to our products. Suppliers are competitively selected based on cost, quality and service. Most significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources. We purchase most raw materials and other  Nordson Corporation 6 Nordson Corporation 6 Nordson Corporation 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods. While these items are generally available from multiple sources, the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials and tariffs on certain raw materials, particularly imports from China, as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials, components and sourced finished goods. We monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality, service, financial stability and price. We currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers, but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers. Senior operating management supervises an extensive quality control program for our equipment, machinery and systems, and manufacturing processes. Natural gas, electricity, and other fuels are our primary energy sources. However, standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed. Over the last year, we have seen a stabilization of the global supply chain and improved lead times. We enhanced our risk mitigation and sourcing efforts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Logistics flows have improved, and global forwarding rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to see moderate rate increases on parcel and domestic trucking activity.   Intellectual Property  We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio is strengthened through innovation and brand recognition, and our comprehensive approach for protection and enforcement. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created in the scope of employment, convey all rights to those inventions to us, and restrict the distribution of proprietary information. Risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\". We protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our rights to sell our products both domestically and internationally. Although in the aggregate, our global portfolio of more than 2,100 granted and pending patents and more than 1,000 trademarks are valuable assets that are important to our operations, we believe that our competitive advantage is also largely attributable to the technical, marketing, and sales competence and capabilities of our employees, rather than on any individual patent or trademark. Therefore, we do not consider the expiration or loss of any single patent, trademark, or intellectual property right, to be material to our business as a whole.   Seasonal Variation in Business Historically, the highest volume of sales occurs in the second half of the fiscal year due in large part to the timing of customers\u2019 capital spending programs. Accordingly, fiscal first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers\u2019 capital spending programs and customer holiday shutdowns. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, historic backlog and other unusual events have impacted this historical trend to a degree.  Competitive Conditions We operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large, well-established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers. Our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions, including industry capacity changes, global competition and economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding, sealing, finishing, coating, processing, testing, inspecting and fluid control techniques. Potential uses for our equipment include any production processes that require preparation, modification or curing of surfaces; dispensing, application, processing or control of fluids and materials; or testing and inspecting for quality. Many factors influence our competitive position, including pricing, product quality and service. We maintain a leadership position in our business segments by delivering high-quality, innovative products and technologies, as well as global service and technical support. Working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position. Our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage.  Compliance with Governmental Regulations Our global operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and compliance obligations relating to the manufacturing, designing and servicing of highly complex products and solutions. Examples of such  Nordson Corporation 7 Nordson Corporation 7 Nordson Corporation 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents regulations, include, but are not limited to, import and export controls, data privacy, environmental, product safety, corruption, bribery, employment and labor. To support our policy of compliance in every jurisdiction we do business, we have robust internal controls, quality management systems, and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of non-compliance. We also have safeguards established to identify non-compliance concerns through internal and external audits and risk assessments, as well as an ethics helpline reporting system. The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business.  For additional information about the risks associated with these laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" We transact with customers and suppliers in numerous geographies around the world and are required to comply with U.S. and non-U.S. import, export and sanctions laws (collectively \u201cTrade Laws\u201d). We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of Trade Laws, and we regularly monitor and adjust our programs and training to reflect changes in Trade Laws or changes in our business. Geopolitical events may result in changes to Trade Laws that may impact our ability to transact business involving certain countries, certain items or certain counterparties, or may impose additional costs or complexity relating to tariffs, taxes, duties or adjustments to our compliance programs, training, or personnel requirements. We are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. The risk of data privacy breaches cannot be entirely eliminated, creating risks of fines and penalties.  Additionally,  privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\"), and the interpretation and enforcement of these and similar laws and regulations, are continuously evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may develop and the costs and complexity of future compliance. We are also subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental, safety and health laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land and water and the generation, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Under certain of these laws, we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination. We are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses, many of which require periodic modification and renewal. The operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental, safety and health risks, and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate. We believe that we operate in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses. We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs or legal claims related to environmental regulations, and we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities. We believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings, liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliance-related costs and expenses may not arise in the future. For example, future adoption of new or amended environmental laws, regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances could require us to incur costs and expenses that may have a material effect, but cannot be presently anticipated. We believe that policies, practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material regulation or compliance obligations arising from our operations. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign regulation and laws during 2023 had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Based upon consideration of currently available information, we believe liabilities for any such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or liquidity, but we cannot guarantee that material liabilities may not arise from regulation and compliance obligations in the future.  Human Capital Resources  Employee Profile As of October\u00a031, 2023, we had approximately 7,900 full-time and part-time employees, including 115 at our Amherst, Ohio, facility who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on November 16, 2025. Total Rewards As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and  Nordson Corporation 8 Nordson Corporation 8 Nordson Corporation 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health, welfare and retirement benefits. We focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including mental health support access, telemedicine and healthy weight loss programs. We believe that these solutions have helped us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population.  In the U.S., we match contributions to a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (the \u201cSavings Plan\u201d) for all eligible employees, in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar contributed by the employee until the employee contributions reach 6% of her or his base compensation. In addition, non-union new hires and re-hires as of July 1, 2021 are eligible for an additional enhanced 401(k) contribution of 3% eligible earnings. All contributions by employees into the Savings Plan are fully vested immediately. Company contributions, both the match and enhanced contribution, have a three-year graded vesting schedule and vest at 33 1/3% each year until fully vested after three years of employment. We also maintain a non-qualified, unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation plan for the benefit of eligible management employees whose benefits under the Savings Plan are limited by the benefit restrictions of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, non-union employees hired prior to July 1, 2021 are eligible to participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the \u201cSalaried Pension Plan\u201d). The Salaried Pension Plan is designed to work together with social security benefits to provide employees with up to 30 years of service retirement income replacement that is approximately 55% of eligible compensation, subject to the Internal Revenue Code maximum monthly benefit. Participants fully vest in the Salaried Pension Plan after five years of service. All eligible union employees hired prior to November 1, 2004 participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the \u201cHourly Pension Plan\u201d). The Hourly Pension Plan provides a multiplier for each year of service to supplement employees\u2019 retirement income. We also maintain a supplemental retirement benefit restoration plan (\u201cExcess Defined Benefit Pension Plan\u201d), which is an unfunded, non-qualified plan that is designed to provide retirement benefits to U.S.-based eligible participants hired prior to July 1, 2021, as a replacement for retirement benefits limited by regulations under the Internal Revenue Code.  In 2022, we launched a global recognition program that allows managers and peers to recognize the special achievements of others through both written recognition shared on a company awards feed, as well as monetary recognition that allows a recipient to choose a physical gift, gift card or donate the value of their recognition to charity. We also continue our service award program, which demonstrates appreciation and thanks to longstanding employees with five or more years of service. Service milestones are recognized at each five-year increment by presentation of a digital and/or printed certificate with an invitation to select a recognition award via an online catalog. Talent Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, products and customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. Attracting and retaining the best talent relies on our ability to provide a diverse and inclusive workplace, personal and professional growth opportunities, and a rewarding employee experience. We strive to uphold a culture of shared knowledge, appreciation and success. We believe that our average tenure across the globe reflects our positive workplace culture and the strong engagement of our employees. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. Talent development and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program. Development plans are created and monitored to ensure progress is made along the established timelines. Development plans also intersect with our mission, particularly as we strive to be responsible to our communities.  One of our core values\u2014Respect for People\u2014reflects the behavior we strive to include in every aspect of the way we conduct business. Our approach encompasses inclusion awareness and skill-building, intentionality with respect to diversity in our hiring and selection process and performance management and succession planning that recognizes the importance of diversity.  Nordson\u2019s employee resource groups strengthen our commitment to fostering an inclusive, diverse workplace where everyone feels like they belong. Participation in these groups is open to all employees. We regularly reflect on our progress and explore opportunities to improve our inclusion and diversity programs, including at the executive leadership and Board levels.
