Background As described below, Howmet Aerospace Inc. was previously named Arconic Inc. and, prior to that, Alcoa Inc. The Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction. On April 1, 2020, Arconic Inc. separated its businesses (the \u201cArconic Inc. Separation Transaction\u201d) into two independent, publicly traded companies: Howmet Aerospace Inc. (the new name for Arconic Inc.) and Arconic Corporation. Following this separation, Howmet retained the Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures, and Forged Wheels businesses; and its prior Rolled Products, Aluminum Extrusions, and Building and Construction Systems businesses were spun-off to Arconic Corporation. In connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, Howmet and Arconic Corporation entered into several agreements that govern the relationship of the parties following the separation. The 2017 Reincorporation in Delaware. On December 31, 2017, Arconic Inc., then a Pennsylvania corporation, changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Pennsylvania to Delaware.  The Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction. On November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. completed the separation of its business (the \u201cAlcoa Inc. Separation Transaction\u201d) into two independent, publicly traded companies: Arconic Inc. (the new name for Alcoa Inc., which, through the transactions described above, later became Howmet Aerospace Inc.) and Alcoa Corporation. Following this separation, the Company retained the Engineered Products and Solutions, Global Rolled Products, and Transportation and Construction Solutions businesses; and its previous Alumina and Primary Metals businesses, rolling mill operations in Warrick, Indiana and 25.1% interest in the Ma\u2019aden Rolling Company were spun-off to Alcoa Corporation. In connection with the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction, the two companies entered into several agreements that govern their post-separation relationship. Overview Howmet is a leading global provider of advanced engineered solutions for the aerospace and transportation industries. The Company\u2019s primary businesses focus on jet engine components, aerospace fastening systems, and airframe structural components necessary for mission-critical performance and efficiency in aerospace and defense applications, as well as forged aluminum wheels for commercial transportation.

The Company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available. Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The Company\u2019s rights under its patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Howmet generally concern particular products, manufacturing equipment or techniques. Howmet\u2019s business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and technological advancement, the Company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. As of the end of 2022, the Company\u2019s worldwide patent portfolio consists of approximately 938 granted patents and 205 pending patent applications. The Company also has a significant number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The Company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits. With respect to domestic and international registered trademarks, the Company has many that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include the name Howmet\u00ae metal castings, Huck\u00ae fasteners, and Dura-Bright\u00ae wheels with easy-clean surface treatments. A significant trademark filing campaign for the names \u201cHowmet\u201d and \u201cHowmet Aerospace\u201d along with its \u201cH\u201d logo was initiated in 2019, in support of the corporate launch of Howmet Aerospace Inc. As of the end of 2022, the Company\u2019s worldwide trademark portfolio consists of approximately 1,569 registered trademarks and 94 pending trademark applications. The Company\u2019s rights under its trademarks are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. Competitive Conditions The Company\u2019s segments - Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures, and Forged Wheels - are subject to substantial and intense competition in the markets they serve. Although Howmet believes its advanced technology, manufacturing processes and experience provide advantages to Howmet\u2019s customers, such as high quality and superior mechanical properties that meet the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 most stringent requirements, many of the products Howmet makes can be produced by competitors using similar types of manufacturing processes as well as alternative forms of manufacturing. Despite intense competition, Howmet continues as a market leader in most of its principal markets. We believe that factors such as Howmet\u2019s technological expertise, state-of-the-art capabilities, capacity, quality, engaged employees and long-standing customer relationships enable the Company to maintain its competitive position. Principal competitors include Berkshire Hathaway Inc., through its 2016 acquisition of Precision Castparts Corporation and subsidiaries, for titanium and titanium-based alloys, precision forgings, seamless rolled rings, investment castings, including airfoils, and aerospace fasteners; VSMPO (Russia) for titanium and titanium-based alloys and precision forgings; Allegheny Technologies, Inc.\u2019s High-Performance Materials & Components segment for titanium and titanium-based alloys and precision forgings; Lisi Aerospace (France) for aerospace fasteners; and Aubert & Duval (part of Eramet Group in France) for precision forgings. Other competitors include Doncasters Group Ltd. (U.K.) and Consolidated Precision Products Corp. (owned by Warburg Pincus and Berkshire Partners) for investment castings; Weber Metals (part of Otto Fuchs) for precision forgings; and Forgital and Frisa (Mexico) for seamless rings. Forged Wheels competes against aluminum and steel wheel suppliers in the commercial transportation industry under the product brand name Alcoa\u00ae Wheels for the major regions that it serves (North America, Europe, Japan, China, South America, and Australia). Its larger aluminum wheel competitors are Accuride Corporation, Speedline (member of the Ronal Group), Nippon Steel Corporation, Dicastal, Alux, and Wheels India Limited. In recent years, Forged Wheels has seen an increase in the number of aluminum wheel suppliers (both forged and cast aluminum wheels) from China, Taiwan, India and South Korea attempting to penetrate the global commercial transportation market. 6 6 6  Table of Contents Table of Contents Several of Howmet\u2019s largest customers have captive superalloy furnaces for producing airfoil investment castings for their own use. Many other companies around the world also produce superalloy investment castings, and some of these companies currently compete with Howmet in the aerospace and other markets, while others are capable of competing with the Company should they choose to do so. International competition in the investment castings, fasteners, rings and forgings markets may also increase in the future as a result of strategic alliances among engine original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), aero-structure prime contractors, and overseas companies, especially in developing markets, particularly where \u201coffset\u201d or \u201clocal content\u201d requirements create purchase obligations with respect to products manufactured in or directed to a particular country. Government Regulations and Environmental Matters Our operations and activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to the environment. In 2022, compliance with these laws, rules and regulations did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Additionally, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2023. For a discussion of the risks associated with certain applicable laws and regulations, see \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Information relating to environmental matters is included in Note V to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 under the caption \u201cEnvironmental Matters.\u201d  Human Capital To attract, recruit, develop and retain world-class talent, the Company has created a culture that embraces diversity, drives inclusion, and empowers and engages our employees. Our Code of Conduct describes how we lead with integrity and work with one another while supporting our stakeholders. The Company provides competitive wages, benefits and terms of employment.  Attracting and recruiting candidates through workforce planning, increased hiring efficiency and effective onboarding has been a priority for the Company. The Company\u2019s new Applicant Tracking System supports the dissemination of our job vacancies to a wider range of diverse partners. As an example, our campus recruitment platform provides an ability to proactively reach a broad talent network as the system of record for more than 9.2\u00a0million students and 1,300 schools across the United States. To retain new talent, the Company offers an onboarding program to develop a sense of belonging, teamwork and productivity that is uniform across the organization.  The Company enables our employees to own their development and create rewarding careers that draw on their aptitudes and support their ambitions. Using a human capital management platform, employees can build a professional profile to share their career aspirations and learn new skills. This platform allows us to align employee goals and growth with the Company\u2019s future business needs so that we can pinpoint potential successor candidates and build their readiness for their future roles. Our talent review and succession planning process is an ongoing priority and is sponsored and led by our CEO with oversight by the Board of Directors. We have started to use a data-driven approach to track how our employees are progressing through our organization. We seek to identify high performers and support their development into potential future leaders, with a particular focus on providing equitable opportunities to individuals who are members of underrepresented groups. Our Employee Resource Groups continue to be fundamental to building our culture of inclusion. Focusing on Gender, LGBTQ+, African Heritage, Hispanic, Veteran, European and Next Generation, these networks provide colleagues with valuable support and advice, create development opportunities, and provide leadership with feedback that raises awareness of issues and challenges. The Company also provides diversity awareness training and resources. Our Board of Directors and Executive Leadership team review diversity, equity and inclusion activity on a regular basis, and have been actively involved in \u2018Meet the Leader\u2019 sessions with our employees throughout the year.  Howmet\u2019s strong health and safety culture empowers our employees and contractors to take personal responsibility for their actions and the safety of their coworkers. This culture is supported by internal policies, standards, rules and procedures that clearly articulate our stringent requirements for working safely in all of our worldwide facilities. The Company embeds annual health and safety goals and objectives into its operating plans to progress against our ultimate goal of zero incidents. We prioritize our risk management processes toward the prevention of fatality and serious injury. Employees Total worldwide employment at the end of 2022 was approximately 21,400 employees in 23 countries.  Within the United States, there are eight collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates between Howmet and various labor unions. Of these eight, the largest workforce covered under a collective bargaining agreement is between Howmet and the United Autoworkers (\u201cUAW\u201d) at our Whitehall, Michigan location. This covers approximately 1,300 employees; the current agreement expires on March 31, 2023. The Whitehall, Michigan location has been preparing for the expiration of this collective bargaining agreement over the course of several months and has started negotiations with the union prior to the  7 7 7  Table of Contents Table of Contents agreement\u2019s expiration date.
