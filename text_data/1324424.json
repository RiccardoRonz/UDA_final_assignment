Item\u00a01.\u00a0Business COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic, and measures to contain the virus, including government travel restrictions and quarantine orders, had an unprecedented impact on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business, financial results and financial condition. With the evolution of milder COVID-19 variants, availability of multiple vaccine booster doses and increasing familiarity with the virus, many COVID-19 related travel restrictions have been lifted, and countries around the world reopened their borders for foreign travel. In 2022, we experienced a strong recovery in travel demand. However, we note that the recovery has been uneven with different regions experiencing different rates of recovery. Despite positive developments, the full duration and total impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain, and therefore it is difficult to predict any future impact on the travel industry and, in particular, our business.  Overview  Expedia Group, Inc. is an online travel company, and our mission is to power global travel for everyone, everywhere. We believe travel is a force for good. Travel is an essential human experience that strengthens connections, broadens horizons and bridges divides. We leverage our supply portfolio, platform and technology capabilities across an extensive portfolio of consumer brands, and provide solutions to our business partners, to empower travelers to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel.  At the end of 2022, we had approximately 3 million lodging properties available, including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings through Vrbo, approximately 900,000 hotels and alternative accommodations through our other brands, over 500 airlines, packages, rental cars, cruises, insurance, as well as activities and experiences.  Travel suppliers distribute and market products via our apps, desktop and mobile offerings, as well as through alternative distribution channels, our business partnerships and our call centers in order to reach our extensive global audience. In addition, our advertising and media businesses help other businesses, primarily travel providers, reach a large multi-platform audience of travelers around the globe. 1 1 1 Table of Contents Table of Contents Historical Development  Over 25 years ago, we began operations as one of the first online travel agencies (\u201cOTAs\u201d) and played a significant role in revolutionizing and democratizing travel, by empowering customers to manage their own travel plans. We did so by building and then leveraging proprietary technology to connect partners and their respective inventory to those travelers, while unlocking the marketplace for travel to other businesses as well. Since then, the travel industry has experienced significant transformation, including the material shift from offline to online travel booking. This transformation led to many years of exciting growth for OTAs along with increased competition. In order to remain innovative and competitive, we made several strategic acquisitions, which materially expanded the breadth and depth of our Company. Much of our strategy leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic focused on our brands competing aggressively for share all the around the world, each with their own offerings and benefits. However, it also created certain complexities and inefficiencies over time.  To reduce complexity and improve operations, in 2020, we shifted to a platform operating model, which enabled us to deliver more scalable services and operate much more efficiently. For example, we now manage our marketing investments holistically across the entire brand portfolio, allowing us to optimize our spend to achieve better returns, and run on a unified marketing technology platform, improving our performance by scaling our marketing capabilities. We also shifted to a unified brand strategy within our Retail business where we have a combined team making decisions across all our brands. These changes were made in an effort to simplify and streamline our organization, improve our cost structure, and the operation of our business. Moreover, to streamline activities and enhance focus on our core businesses, we shut down or sold a number of businesses since the beginning of 2020, including Egencia, a travel management company focused on corporate travel. On November 1, 2021, the sale of Egencia to American Express Global Business Travel (\u201cGBT\u201d) was completed. As part of the transaction, Expedia Group received a minority ownership position in the combined business and entered into a 10-year lodging supply agreement with GBT. Both Egencia pre-closing and the GBT lodging supply agreement impact our B2B segment financials. The result of these cumulative actions enable more focus on improving the overall experience for our travelers.  In 2021, we began evolving our consumer retail strategy from being largely transactionally focused, where we were primarily focused on acquiring customers through performance marketing channels to building direct, longer-lasting relationships with our customers. With that goal in mind, we focused towards increasing customer loyalty and app adoption as loyalty members and app users typically experience higher repeat rates, gross profits and bookings relative to non-loyalty members and non-app users. Further, we aim to provide our customers with a high-quality product experience, strong membership benefits and broad multi-product supply offering, all of which encourages higher conversion, repeat rates and engagement. Market Opportunity and Business Strategy Expedia Group is one of the world\u2019s largest online travel companies, yet our gross bookings represent a single-digit percentage of total worldwide travel spending highlighting the size of our market opportunity. Phocuswright estimates global travel spending, inclusive of alternative accommodations and tours and activities, at approximately $1.6 trillion in 2023. Our focus is to: leverage our brand, supply, and platform technology strength, to provide greater services and value to our travelers, suppliers and business partners, and build longer-lasting direct relationships with our customers.  Leverage Brand and Supply Strength to Power the Travel Ecosystem. We believe the strength of our core brand portfolio and consistent enhancements to product and service offerings, combined with our global scale and broad-based supply, drive increasing value to customers and customer demand. With our significant global audience of travelers, and our deep and broad selection of travel products, we are also able to provide value to supply partners seeking to grow their business through sophisticated technology, a better understanding of travel retailing and reaching consumers in markets beyond their reach. Our deep product and supply footprint allows us to tailor offerings to target different types of consumers and travel needs, employ geographic segmentation in markets around the world, and leverage brand differentiation, among other benefits. We also market to consumers through a variety of channels, including internet search, metasearch and social and digital media.  Our portfolio of brands, operated and organized by reportable segment are as follows: Retail. Our Retail segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through recognized consumer brands that target a variety of customer segments and geographic regions with tailored offerings. Our portfolio of retail brands include: \u2022Brand Expedia. Brand Expedia is a leading full-service online travel brand in a wide range of countries around the world offering a wide selection of travel products and services.  \u2022Hotels.com. Hotels.com focuses on marketing lodging accommodations.  2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Vrbo. Vrbo operates an online marketplace for the alternative accommodations industry. The Vrbo portfolio includes the vacation rental website, Vrbo, which operates localized websites around the world as well as other regional brands.  \u2022We have multiple other brands including, but not limited to, Orbitz, Travelocity, ebookers and Wotif Group.  While we maintain a large portfolio of consumer brands, we put the majority of our marketing efforts towards our three core consumer brands: Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo. In 2021, we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform called \u201cOne Key\u201d spanning all our main brands, which we expect to launch in 2023. We also market to consumers through a variety of channels, including internet search, metasearch and social and digital media. B2B. Our B2B segment encompasses our Expedia Partner Solutions business. Expedia Partner Solutions partners with businesses in a wide spectrum of countries across a wide range of travel and non-travel verticals including airlines, offline travel agents, online retailers, corporate travel management and financial institutions, who market Expedia Group rates and availabilities to their travelers. Expedia Partner Solutions' partners can benefit from our technology and supply in the way that best suits their business. This includes connecting to Expedia Group's travel content through Expedia Partner Solutions\u2019 API, Rapid; adopting one of Expedia Partner Solutions\u2019 customized white label or co-branded ecommerce template solutions; or a powerful agent booking tool, Expedia Travel Affiliate Agent Program (TAAP). Prior to its sale on November 1, 2021, our B2B segment also included Egencia, which was our full-service travel management company. We also offer an \u201coptimized distribution\u201d product to help hotel suppliers distribute wholesale rates through authorized channels. Our B2B segment also includes room nights, gross bookings, and associated economics from our lodging supply agreement we entered into with GBT in conjunction with the sale of Egencia.  trivago. Our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites. trivago is our majority-owned hotel metasearch company, based in Dusseldorf, Germany. The online platform gives travelers access to price comparisons from hundreds of booking websites for millions of hotels and other accommodations. Officially launched in 2005, trivago is a leading global brand in hotel search and can be accessed worldwide. The company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and trades under the symbol \"TRVG.\" Leverage Our Platform to Deliver More Rapid Product Innovation Resulting in Better Traveler Experiences.  During 2020, Expedia Group unified its technology, product, data engineering, and data science teams to build services and capabilities that can be leveraged across our business units to provide value-add services to our travel suppliers and serve our end customers. The unified team structure enables us to deliver more scalable services and operate more efficiently. All of our transaction-based businesses also now benefit from our shared platform infrastructure, including customer servicing and support, data centers, search capabilities, payment processing, and fraud operations.  As we continue to evolve our shared platform infrastructure, our focus is on developing technical capabilities that support various travel products while using simpler, standard architecture and common applications and frameworks. We believe this strategy will enable us to: simultaneously build pieces of technology that work in tandem; ship products faster; create more innovative solutions; and achieve greater scale. Ultimately, we believe this will result in faster product innovation and therefore better traveler experiences. In addition, over time, as we execute on our streamlined application development framework, we believe we can unlock additional platform service opportunities beyond the scope of our internal brands and business travel partners.   In 2021, we began migrating our core Retail brands (Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo) onto one unified technology front-end infrastructure, to increase operating efficiencies. In 2022, we completed the migration of the Hotels.com front-end technology stack on to the Brand Expedia platform, which allowed us to apply our learnings from testing and optimization across our traditional lodging portfolio at much greater scale. In late 2022, we began the technology migration of our Vrbo business onto the Brand Expedia front-end and expect that work to be largely complete in 2023. We provide 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week traveler sales and support by our virtual agent platform, telephone, chat, or e-mail. For purposes of operational flexibility, we use a combination of outsourced and in-house contact centers. Our contact centers are located in several countries throughout the world. We invested significantly in our contact center technologies, with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our contact center agents and we expect to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward. In addition, we have continued to invest in our customer service platform technology, which leverages technology and artificial intelligence to provide our customers with online customer service options and self-service capabilities.  Today our websites and apps are powered through a combination of legacy company-owned data centers and increasingly via cloud platforms. We are nearing the end of a multi-year project to migrate our products, data storage and functionality to public cloud computing services. For our legacy company-owned data centers, our systems infrastructure and web and database  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents servers are housed in various locations, mainly in the United States, which have 24-hour monitoring and engineering support. These data centers have their own generators and multiple back-up systems.  For some critical systems, we have both production and disaster-recovery facilities. Our technology systems are subject to certain risks, which are described below in Part I, Item 1A \u2014 Risk Factors. Business Models We make travel products and services available both on a stand-alone and package basis, primarily through the following business models: the merchant model, the agency model and the advertising model.  \u2022Merchant Model. Under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms, alternative accommodations, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings. For example, we provide travelers access to book hotel room reservations through our contracts with lodging suppliers, which provide us with rates and availability information for rooms but for which we have no control over the rooms and do not bear inventory risk. Our travelers pay us for merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip, generally when they book the reservation. The majority of our merchant transactions relate to lodging bookings.  \u2022Agency Model. Under the agency model, we facilitate travel bookings and act as the agent in the transaction, passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider. We receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier and/or traveler. We record revenue on air transactions when the traveler books the transaction, as we do not typically provide significant post booking services to the traveler and payments due to and from air carriers are typically due at the time of ticketing. Additionally, we generally record agency revenue from the hotel when the stayed night occurs as we provide post booking services to the traveler and, thus consider the stay as when our performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our agency gross bookings relate to air bookings. \u2022Advertising Model. Under the advertising model we offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings across several of our transaction-based websites, as well as on our majority-owned metasearch site, trivago. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had total revenue of $11.7 billion, with merchant, agency and advertising, media and other accounting for 66%, 26%, and 8% of total revenue, respectively. Our Expedia Traveler Preference (ETP) program offers, for participating hotels, customers the choice of whether to pay Expedia Group in advance under our merchant model (Expedia Collect) or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay under the agency model (Hotel Collect).  In addition, through various of our Expedia Group-branded and other multi-product websites, travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages for a specified period at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately. Travelers typically select packages based on the total package price or by purchasing one product and receiving a discounted price to attach additional products. The use of the merchant travel components in packages and multi-product purchases enable us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other pricing models. In addition, we also offer pre-assembled package offerings, further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers. We expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model. Marketing and Promotions Our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our retail brands, drive traffic and ultimately bookings while optimizing ongoing traveler acquisition costs. Our long-term success and profitability depend on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a cost-effective manner, as well as our ability to attract repeat customers and customers that come directly to our brands. We manage our marketing investments holistically across the brand portfolio in our Retail segment to optimize results for the Company and make decisions on a market by market and customer segment basis that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity, the expected returns and the competitive environment. Our marketing channels primarily include brand advertising through online and offline channels, loyalty programs, mobile apps, search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch, social media, direct and/or personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct e-mail communication with our travelers. Our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents suppliers based on our supplier relationships. Our current traveler loyalty programs include Hotels.com Rewards on Hotels.com global websites and Expedia\u00ae Rewards on a wide array of Brand Expedia points of sale, as well as Orbitz Rewards on Orbitz.com. In 2021, we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform called \u201cOne Key\u201d spanning all our main brands, which we expect to launch in 2023. We also make use of affiliate marketing. Several of our branded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clicked through to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites. In exchange for this traffic, we pay the affiliate partner a commission.  Travel Suppliers We make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies, property owners and managers, large and small commercial airlines, car rental companies, cruise lines, destination service providers, and other travel partners. We seek to build and maintain long-term, strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system (\u201cGDS\u201d) partners. An important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing, as well as build new, relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners. We strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative, targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue, while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs. Our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale, including participation in need-based, seasonal and event-driven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building. We developed proprietary technology to assist both hotel and alternative accommodation suppliers in managing, and marketing their supply, whether this is direct through our proprietary central reservation tools or through third-party channel managers. Our \u201cdirect connect\u201d technology allows suppliers to upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems and dynamically manage reservations and traveler needs through our messaging and chat platforms. Marketing tools assist hotels and alternative accommodations in tailoring demand to their requirements and our revenue management product provides pricing insights. We also offer an \u201cOptimized Distribution\u201d product to help hotel suppliers distribute wholesale rates through authorized channels. Our suite of white label website offerings power hotel, and package booking on suppliers' own websites. Vrbo's alternative accommodation listing services offers our supply partners a set of tools to help them manage an availability calendar, respond to customer inquiries, edit the content of a property listing, as well as provide various other services to manage reservations or drive incremental sales volume.  Distribution Partners. GDSs, also referred to as computer reservation services, provide a centralized, comprehensive repository of travel suppliers\u2019 \u2018content\u2019 \u2014 such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline point-to-point flights, or \u2018segments.\u2019 The GDSs act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies, allowing agents to reserve and book flights, rooms or other travel products. Our relationships with GDSs primarily relate to our air business. We use Amadeus and Sabre as our GDS segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers. Competition Our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets. We believe international markets represent especially large opportunities for Expedia Group and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses to achieve global scale. We also believe that Expedia Group is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global, travel marketplace. Our competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers, including travel agencies, tour operators, travel supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services, large online portals and search websites, certain travel metasearch websites, mobile travel applications, social media websites, as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites. We face these competitors in local, regional, national and/or international markets. In some cases, competitors are offering more favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult. We also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites, which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs. Retail. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand, quality and breadth of travel product supply, product features and usability of our websites and mobile apps, price or promotional offers, customer service as well as offline brand efforts. The emphasis on one or more of these factors varies, depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic. We face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers, such as long standing loyalty programs, complimentary services such as Wi-Fi, and better pricing. Our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction. We face  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents competition from airlines, hotels, alternative accommodation websites, rental car companies, cruise operators and other travel service providers, whether working individually or collectively, some of which are suppliers to our websites. Our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape, including the emergence of new competitors or business models, and supplier consolidation. B2B. We are one of the leading players in the global B2B travel space today servicing a wide range of customers across both travel and non-travel verticals including corporate travel management, airlines, offline travel agents, online retailers and financial institutions. We face competition from travel consolidators and wholesalers of travel products, other OTAs with B2B offerings, and other technology and content providers. We differentiate ourselves from our B2B competitors primarily with our breadth and depth of global supply, dedicated partner and traveler support, and market leading travel technology through our Rapid API, white label or co-branded template offerings, and Expedia Travel Affiliate Agent Program (TAAP), a powerful agent booking tool. We also offer an \u201coptimized distribution\u201d product to help hotel suppliers distribute wholesale rates through authorized channels. Our extensive work building out our global supply has allowed us to negotiate competitive pricing with suppliers and provide added value to travelers. We intend to continue to grow the business via a combination of increasing our wallet share with existing customers, winning contracts with new customers, as well as the introduction of additional products and services.  Intellectual Property Rights  Our intellectual property and appurtenant rights, including our patents, trademarks, copyright rights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology, and trade secrets, are important components of our business. For example, we rely heavily upon our intellectual property and proprietary information in our content, brands, domain names and website URLs, software code, proprietary technology, ratings indexes, informational databases, images, graphics and other components that support and make up our services. We have acquired some of our intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions, as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties. We protect our intellectual property and proprietary information through registration and by relying on our terms of use, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, as well as international, national, state and common law rights. In addition, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors, and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which, if discovered, might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties. We maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with national trademark offices, maintaining appropriate registrations, securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate and necessary, respectively. We protect our trademarks, copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses. Trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought, sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate. Contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract. We have established a formal patent program with a newly-formed Patent Review Committee for evaluating our innovations and determining the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect inventions and obtaining licenses in patents as circumstances may warrant, and we anticipate continuing to devote greater resources to seeking patent protection for Expedia Group\u2019s innovations. In connection with our copyrightable content, we post and institute procedures under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and similar Host Privilege statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs, text and other content uploaded by users. However, differences between statutes, limitations on immunity, and moderation efforts may affect our ability to claim immunity. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm our business. 6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Regulation We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry, the alternative accommodation industry, internet businesses, and the provision of travel services, including registration in various states as \u201csellers of travel\u201d and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds  In addition, our businesses are subject to regulation by the U.S.\u00a0Department of Transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation, including those relating to advertising and accessibility. We are also increasingly subject to new and evolving short-term rental laws and regulations that impose additional property registration, disclosure and data provision requirements.  In international markets, we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets, including, in some countries, pricing display requirements, licensing and registration requirements, mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions, industry specific value-added tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages. For example, the European Economic Community Council Directive on Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package, including supplier failure. Additionally, we must comply with an expanding array of international laws and regulations aimed at online businesses, including the European Union\u2019s Digital Services Act and DAC7, which impose new information gathering and reporting requirements as well as obligations to respond to inquiries about website content.  We are also subject to consumer protection, privacy and consumer data, payments, labor, economic and trade sanction programs, tax, and anti-trust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) came into force in January 2023 and applies enhanced data protection requirements in the State of California similar to those that have existed since 2018 under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Five other U.S. states have passed similar laws, and data protection laws have been passed or are being discussed in a number of other jurisdictions. These data protection/privacy laws add compliance complexity, risks, and costs. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. However, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies, so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements may relate to our business in the future. Human Capital Management People, Company Culture and Benefits At Expedia Group, our mission is to power global travel for everyone, everywhere. We believe travel is a force for good, and we are committed to making it more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we have a team of 16,500 employees across more than 50 countries focused on using our extensive data and technology to create amazing travel experiences. As of December\u00a031, 2022, over one half of our people work in technology roles.  We aim to go above and beyond to take care of our people \u2013 by providing opportunities for them to grow and develop, benefits that fuel their passion for travel and resources that foster their well-being. While competition for talent is fierce, particularly in the United States and in Seattle where our headquarters are located, we believe we offer something different: an opportunity to strengthen connections, broaden horizons and bridge divides through travel. We know the power of travel and understand the amazing things we can achieve by making it more accessible to everyone. And we are focused on attracting and retaining the best and brightest people to help us do that. To that end, we offer competitive compensation, talent development and training opportunities and differentiated benefits, including healthcare and retirement programs, a wellness and travel allowance, an employee assistance program, financial education tools, a global resource for diverse maternity and family building advice, an employee stock purchase program, time-off programs, volunteer days off, a transportation program, onsite medical care and travel discounts, among others.    Inclusion and Diversity To best serve our employees, customers, partners and community, we aim to build inclusive and diverse workplaces that promote belonging, respect, voice and equal opportunity with initiatives such as: \u2022Employee-led Inclusion Business Groups focused on promoting awareness related to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, military status, disability and gender, as well as allyship for underrepresented identities; \u2022Educational programs designed to identify and mitigate bias and exclusive practices in traditional recruitment, hiring, talent review, promotion and marketing processes;  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Recruiting and assessment processes based on skills and designed to limit the impact of unconscious bias; \u2022Dedicated diversity sourcing, marketing, and recruiting teams focused on engaging underrepresented talent and increasing representation in top of funnel and interview slates; \u2022An onboarding program that includes a focus on intercultural awareness, ally skills and our inclusion resources; \u2022Employment and hiring targets for women to occupy 50% of leadership roles by the end of 2025 and for 25% of U.S. external hires to come from racially and ethnically underrepresented groups; \u2022Pay fairness evaluation tools and additional budgets to ensure employees are compensated fairly; \u2022Direct and easy access to accessibility tools enabling people with different needs to thrive at work; \u2022Using employee surveys and external benchmarking to understand identity-based trends, set clear goals, develop strategies and measure progress towards increased headcount, hiring, compensation, advancement and retention of underrepresented employee groups; and \u2022Programs with our travel partners that focus on underserved travelers, drive industry engagement related to inclusion and diversity, and promote related outreach efforts in local and global communities.  COVID-19 Response Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees have remained focused on providing positive experiences for travelers. After reopening our global offices with enhanced health and safety measures, we adopted a hybrid work model for most of our offices in April 2022, designed to make the most of the productivity and collaborative energy that comes from working together in our offices while preserving the convenience and flexibility of working from home. In parallel, we augmented benefits programs to support employees with the transition, including expanding the scope of our travel and wellness allowance to include home office expenses and a broader range of mental and emotional health services; offering new telehealth, wellness education, and family support services; and making existing resources and services easier to access via online channels. Equity Ownership and Vote  As of December\u00a031, 2022, there were approximately 147.8 million shares of Expedia Group common stock and approximately 5.5 million shares of Expedia Class\u00a0B common stock outstanding. Expedia Group stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock and ten votes for each share of Class B common stock outstanding. As of December\u00a031, 2022, Mr. Diller and The Diller Foundation d/b/a The Diller - von Furstenberg Family Foundation (the \u201cFamily Foundation\u201d), on whose board of directors Mr. Diller and certain of his family members serve as directors, collectively owned 100% (5.5 million shares) of Expedia Group\u2019s outstanding Class B common stock (and, assuming conversion of all shares of Class B common stock into shares of common stock, collectively owned approximately 4% of Expedia Group\u2019s outstanding common stock), representing approximately 27% of the total voting power of all shares of Expedia Group common stock and Class B common stock outstanding. We refer to the shares of Expedia Class B common stock held by Mr. Diller and the Family Foundation as the \"Class B Shares.\" In connection with the Company\u2019s acquisition in 2019 of Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc.
