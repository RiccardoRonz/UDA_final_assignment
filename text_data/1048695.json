We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise and service provider customers. Accordingly, we offer a broad range of support services that includes phone and online technical support, hardware repair and replacement, software updates, online tools, consulting, and training services. We provide these services directly to customers and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners. Our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base. Product Development We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to innovate and to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers and partners. Our engineering organization uses standard processes for the development, documentation, and quality control of services, software, and systems that are designed to meet these goals. These processes include working with our business development and marketing teams, customers, and partners to identify technology innovation opportunities to better meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets. We have had dedicated teams focused on testing new disruptive innovations in technology, business models, or customer segments. We expect innovations resulting from the work of these teams will be complementary to our goal of delivering the broadest and most consistent portfolio of solutions across cloud and on-premises environments. Our engineering teams are primarily located in Seattle and Spokane, Washington; Hyderabad, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; San Jose, California; and Cork, Ireland. Members of our engineering teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our solutions. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. F5 holds various patents in the United States and internationally (with applications pending for various aspects of our technology). We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products. Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the United States. Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate software licensed from several third-party sources into our products. These are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination. While we may not be able to renew all of these licenses in the future, we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally. Sales and Marketing Our customers include a wide variety of enterprises and service providers among Fortune 1000 and Business Week Global 1000 companies, including those in technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing, healthcare, and government. In fiscal year 2023, sales outside of the Americas represented 43.7% of our net revenues. Refer to Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area. Sales We sell our products and services to large and medium enterprises, government entities, and service providers through a variety of routes to market and channels. Our sales teams sell our products and services directly to customers by working closely with our channel partners including distributors, value-added resellers (\u201cVARs\u201d), managed service providers (\u201cMSPs\u201d), and systems integrators. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents F5 sales teams. Our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads from marketing and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources. Our outside sales team works directly with partners and customers across the globe. Our field sales personnel are located in major cities across our three sales regions. Field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to sell our products and services to their customers. We reward partners that identify new business and provide sales expertise for our portfolio of products and solutions through various incentive programs. Systems engineers, with deep technical domain expertise, support our regional sales account managers and channel partners providing pre-sale technical solution engineering and support, as needed. Distributors, VARs, and MSPs. As a key component of our sales strategy, we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors, local and specialized distributors, VARs, and MSPs. We derive a majority of our product sales from VARs and MSPs, relying on our large distributors for fulfillment, training, and partner enablement. Our agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products. These agreements typically have one-year terms with no obligation to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements. For fiscal year 2023, sales to two of our worldwide distributors, Ingram Micro, Inc. and Synnex Corporation represented 15.6% and 15.0% of our total revenues, respectively. Our agreements with distributors are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 90 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term. The agreements grant certain distributors the right to distribute our products to resellers, with no minimum purchase requirements. Systems integrators. We also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators, including Dell Services, DXC, HP Enterprise Services, and IBM Global Services, who include our products as core components of application deployments or network-based solutions they deploy for their customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead, they typically recommend and/or manage our products as a part of broader solutions supporting enterprise applications and internet facing systems that incorporate our technology for security, high availability, and enhanced performance. Resellers and technology partners. Historically, our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors. Currently, we partner with many technology partners and public cloud providers who resell our products. We have ongoing partnerships with the major cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform and have expanded our reseller routes to market to include their public cloud marketplaces. F5 has recently signed a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (\u201cSCA\u201d) with AWS and are actively engaged with Microsoft Azure on private offers levering our software on Azure. Our business development team manages these relationships and closely monitors adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market. Marketing As we continue to expand our offerings and our range of consumption models, we are focused on driving the compelling and unique value proposition of F5 among our existing customers, including new buying centers within existing customers, as well as with new customers. To do so, we are revitalizing our brand to inform customers about our expanded portfolio and broaden our reach with new customers. We continue to focus on our core NetOps persona while seeking to expand our relationships with DevOps, SecOps, CISO and Cloud Architect audiences. We invest in driving brand, demand, and advocacy experiences, addressing touchpoints across the customer journey to ensure we do all we can to enable our customers to realize value in their investments with F5. To maximize our reach and impact, we continue to meet customers where they are by increasing our focus and investments in more digitally enabled, personalized, and frictionless experiences at scale.  Manufacturing We outsource the manufacturing of our systems to a third-party contract manufacturer, Flex Ltd. (\"Flex\"), for building, assembling, and testing according to our specifications at Flex's facilities in Guadalajara, Mexico and Zhuhai, China. Flex also performs material procurement, assembly, system test, quality control, and direct shipment on our behalf.  We provide a rolling forecast that allows Flex to stock component parts and other materials, plan capacity, and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end-user demand. Flex procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast, assembles the products, and tests them according to our specifications. Generally, we do not own the system components. Hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components.  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Many of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers. However, we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources, and lead times for these components can vary significantly. Per the terms and conditions with our agreement with Flex, if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders. Systems built in Guadalajara are shipped to the Flex fulfillment center in Milpitas, California for distribution primarily to distributors, value-added resellers, or end users in the Americas and EMEA. Systems built and fulfilled in Zhuhai are distributed to partners and customers in APAC. Title to the products transfers from Flex to us and then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location.  Backlog Backlog is primarily systems-based and represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be fulfilled and invoiced to customers with approved credit status. Orders are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers, or product specification changes by customers. Although we believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be canceled by the customer prior to fulfillment without significant penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues. At the end of fiscal year 2023, we had product backlog of approximately $53\u00a0million.  Human Capital Management F5\u2019s commitment to its employees is to be one global and diverse team that is both human-first and high-performance and to attract and grow amazing talent. This commitment is delivered through our culture and engagement, our investment in employees\u2019 growth and development, our focus on diversity and inclusion, and in our compensation, benefits, and wellbeing offerings. Employees As of September\u00a030, 2023, we had 6,524\u00a0employees \u2013 over 99% of whom were full time employees. Our employees are in 47 countries with 49% of employees in the United States. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are in good standing, as evidenced by our bi-annual employee engagement survey results and described in the section below entitled Culture and Engagement. Culture and Engagement We have been able to sustain our strong company culture in a hybrid work model thanks to increased focus on continuously embedding BeF5 and LeadF5 behaviors into our systems, processes, decisions, and conversations. We are constantly reinforcing, rewarding, and recognizing desired behaviors to send the message that they are key to executing our strategy.    We measure the success of and identify areas of improvement for our company culture through global surveys of employee experience and sentiment at least twice each year. As of June 2023, employees reported high satisfaction with F5\u2019s culture on several key questions: \u202283% of employees favorably rate \u201cI am proud to work for F5.\" \u202287% of employees favorably rate \u201cAt F5, employees are treated equally and fairly regardless of their background.\u201d 10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u202280% of employees favorably rate \u201cF5 has a great culture.\"\u201d  One survey measure that F5 tracks closely as a gauge of our culture decreased from fiscal year 2022. As of June 2023, 76% of employees favorably rate \u201cI feel a sense of belonging at F5,\u201d compared to 84% a year prior. The employee comments in the survey highlighted recent changes in fiscal year 2023 related to the reduction in force, Freedom to Flex policy and incentive plans among the key reasons for the decline of our belonging score and underlined the areas F5 needs to enhance to maintain our culture. Growth and Development We provide employees with opportunities to improve their technical and professional knowledge, nurture our innovation ecosystem, strengthen management and leadership, as well as maintain our high standards of business integrity through ongoing compliance training. These development opportunities are available through live employee events during Innovation Months, Idea Fests, Technology Days and Learning Days dedicated to exploring new ideas, such as Generative AI. F5 also offers employees customized learning paths, leadership coaching, global mentor and sponsorship programs, as well as multiple third-party resources to enhance the learning opportunities developed internally. Diversity and Inclusion F5 believes our differences\u2014when embraced with humility and respect\u2014drive smarter decisions, increased innovation, stronger performance, and a culture where everyone can be themselves and reach their full potential.   At F5, we are committed to creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace. Our strategic framework is called \u201cIDEA\u201d: Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Allyship. Each concept in IDEA requires focus and engagement at all levels of the organization and to be embedded into our ways of working. (For more information, please see our most recent Diversity & Inclusion report at F5.com/company/diversity-inclusion). To increase inclusion at F5, we foster communities through our Employee Inclusion Groups (\u201cEIGs\u201d) \u2013 F5 Ability, F5 Appreciates Blackness, F5 Connects Women, F5 Latinx e Hispanos Unidos, F5 Military Veterans, and F5 Pride. In fiscal year 2023, the EIGs focused on intersectional events prioritizing community building, culture and talent development and diverse recruitment, with strategic counsel and support from their executive sponsors. The EIG leaders continue to be recognized for their efforts to build a thriving community of diverse employees across F5 through quarterly bonuses.  F5 offers differentiated development programs to help address the barriers for underrepresented groups in the company. In fiscal year 2023, F5\u2019s commitment to increase representation at F5 for Women, Black, and Latinx employees across management and leadership positions, and the company overall, was a focus of both our mentor and sponsorship programs.  Allyship is critical to the sustainability of our diversity and inclusion program at F5. The F5ers engaging with this program are on a continuous learning journey to build a culture where everyone feels they belong and can reach their full potential. Each month, content is made available to the allyship community to deepen their understanding of experiences different from their own and gain new skills to speak up and speak out as active participants in creating a more diverse and inclusive F5. Compensation, Benefits and Wellbeing F5 aims to attract, reward, and retain extraordinary talent from diverse backgrounds by offering a total compensation package that is equitable, flexible, and market competitive. This includes the pay, incentive plans, restricted stock unit grants (\u201cRSUs\u201d), Employee Stock Purchase Plan, retirement plans, healthcare, paid time off and family leave F5 provides to employees, as well as the programs that support the diverse needs of our employees\u2019 overall health and wellbeing. In fiscal year 2023, F5 launched free and global access to therapy and coaching sessions to all employees, and renewed our popular Wellness Weekends to provide one weekend a quarter when all employees have a set Friday through Monday off to reset and refresh.  Two significant changes were made to F5 employees\u2019 compensation and benefits in fiscal year 2023 in response to both macroeconomic and post-COVID-19 pandemic conditions: \u2022In the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we altered our incentive plans to reduce our operating budgets. F5 eliminated the annual cash bonus for the CEO, reduced annual cash bonuses for executives by 70% and reduced the funding pool by 50% for employee Management by Objective (\"MBO\") plans.  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, F5 updated its Freedom to Flex program to reflect the worldwide expiration of COVID-19 pandemic health and safety protocols. To balance the company\u2019s goals for employee collaboration and connection, with employees continued need for flexibility from their employer, F5 requires all employees within 30 commutable miles of an F5 office, accommodating 30 or more employees, to work in the office for 30 business days each quarter. The remainder of employees worldwide continue to be offered a choice to work fully remote, hybrid or full-time in an F5 office. Environmental, Social & Governance At F5, we care deeply not just about what we do, but how we do it. We consider this our uniquely human-first and high-performance approach to the way we conduct our business, and it is reflected in our commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d).  Environmental. In fiscal year 2023, F5 expanded its environmental initiatives by committing to a science-based target. F5 submitted its target for verification to the Science Based Target Initiative, outlining its commitment to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50%, and reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 43% by 2030 from a 2021 baseline year. The company plans to reduce its operational emissions, referred to as Scope 1 and 2, by sourcing more renewable energy and improving its offices' energy efficiency. F5 identified that the majority of the Company's emissions, however, come from the value chain, referred to as Scope 3. This will require F5 to prioritize more sustainable design and energy performance in its products and services, followed by decarbonizing its supply chain, in order to reach its science-based target. Social. In addition to the employee programs and benefits outlined in the Human Capital Management section above, we continue to prioritize F5 Global Good, the community development initiative that amplifies our employee engagement and diversity and inclusion programs. In fiscal year 2023, more than half of all worldwide employees participated in Global Good programs, volunteering over 10,400 hours and directing the entirety of F5\u2019s donations, through both the Company matching program and grant selection committees. F5 and its employees donated over $3.8\u00a0million to over 3,000 non-profits worldwide in fiscal year 2023.  Governance. Our guiding principle to do the right thing for each other, our customers, our shareholders, and our communities is set forth in F5\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, compliance training programs and most importantly, in the behaviors we measure all employees on: BeF5 and LeadF5. In fiscal year 2023, F5 completed its first Double Materiality Assessment, based on industry benchmarking and the engagement of hundreds of internal and external stakeholders. This process served as F5's most recent climate-related risk identification for risks with a substantive impact and enabled the Company to identify appropriate ESG risks for our enterprise risk assessment process. The oversight of our ESG programs is conducted by the Nominating and ESG Committee of the Board of Directors, where ESG strategy, disclosures and metrics are reviewed each quarter.
