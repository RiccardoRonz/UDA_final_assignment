{"cik": 1065088, "item_1A": "ITEM 1:  BUSINESS   Overview  eBay Inc. was formed as a sole proprietorship in September 1995 and was incorporated in California in May 1996. In April 1998, we reincorporated in Delaware, and in September 1998, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices are located at 2025 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California, 95125, and our telephone number is (408) 376-7008. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, when we refer to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201ceBay\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K, we mean eBay Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.   eBay is a global commerce leader through our Marketplace platforms which connect millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world. The platforms include our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its localized counterparts, including an off-platform business in Japan, as well as eBay\u2019s suite of mobile apps. Our Marketplace platforms are accessible through an online experience (e.g. desktop and laptop computers), iOS and Android mobile devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets) and our application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs,\u201d platform access for third party software developers).  Our Strategy  As a global commerce leader and third-party marketplace, our technologies and services are designed to provide buyers choice and a breadth of relevant inventory from around the globe, and to enable sellers\u2019 access to eBay\u2019s 134\u00a0million buyers worldwide. Our business model and pricing are designed so our business is successful when our sellers are successful. We earn revenue primarily through fees collected on paid sales, inclusive of payment processing and first-party advertising.   eBay\u2019s strategy is to leverage technology to enhance the marketplace experience for our customers to drive growth in Gross Merchandise Volume (\u201cGMV\u201d), while increasing the rate of revenue growth through our managed payments and advertising initiatives and delivering healthy operating margins. Beginning in 2020, we embarked on a multi-year journey to build more compelling category experiences for enthusiastic consumers, to become the partner of choice for sellers and to strengthen trust in relationships with buyers on our Marketplace platforms. We derived a majority of GMV in 2022 from the following product categories \u2014 parts & accessories, collectibles, electronics, fashion, and home & garden.  Since late 2021, eBay has managed payments for all transactions on our Marketplace platforms, delivering buyers and sellers a simplified end-to-end payments experience. Through managed payments, we are able to provide a frictionless experience for current and next-generation customers, consistent with today\u2019s retail standards. We offer buyers more flexibility and choice in how they\u2019d like to pay and offer sellers a more streamlined way to run their businesses.  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents eBay remains focused on growing our first-party advertising revenue through our Promoted Listings suite of products while reducing non-strategic, third-party advertising. We currently offer four Promoted Listings products: Promoted Listings Standard (a cost-per-acquisition product for fixed-price listings), Promoted Listings Express (a cost-per-acquisition product for auction listings), Promoted Listings Advanced (a cost-per-click product) and External Promoted Listings (an off-platform advertising product). Through our portfolio of Promoted Listings offerings, we are providing sellers with data-driven recommendations to optimize their conversion and drive velocity, while testing and building more technology features to drive growth, position eBay as the seller\u2019s platform of choice and surface relevant inventory to buyers.   We have acquired, and also disposed of, a significant number of businesses, technologies, services and products, and we maintain investments in certain businesses. We regularly review and manage our investments to ensure they support eBay\u2019s strategic direction and complement our disciplined approach to value creation, profitability and capital allocation. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions as part of our strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures.  Our Customer Offerings  We provide a number of features for our sellers and buyers that align with our approach to becoming the partner of choice for sellers and building life-long, trusted buyer relationships. These offerings are designed to build trust and confidence on our Marketplace platforms and drive GMV.   To become the partner of choice for sellers, eBay continuously invests in technology to deliver quality selling experiences and products to grow the seller tools ecosystem. The unified listing experience offers an intuitive and cohesive design across all Marketplace platforms \u2014 desktop, mobile and app \u2014 simplifying the listing flow and enhancing seller benefits like video in the listing and doubling the number of images to 24. eBay expanded the Promoted Listings offerings to make it easier for sellers to drive growth in successful listings. We also launched personalized tools, such as coded coupons and newsletters, to support a richer online seller experience. In addition, all Seller Hub users are able to access Terapeak Product Research for free across a number of our markets \u2014 U.S., U.K., Germany, Australia, France, Italy, Spain and Canada \u2014 providing pricing insights and listing quality reports.  To further strengthen our buyers\u2019 confidence and trust in our services, we offer \u201ceBay Money Back Guarantee,\u201d which allows buyers to receive their money back if the item they ordered does not arrive, is faulty or damaged or does not match the listing. eBay Money Back Guarantee covers most items purchased on the eBay Marketplace platform in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Australia, Canada, France, Italy and Spain through a qualifying payment method. In addition, eBay authenticates eligible luxury and collectible items in five categories through \u201cAuthenticity Guarantee\u201d, an independent authentication service available in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Australia and Canada. In our parts & accessories category, we are focused on fitment to ensure that Motors enthusiasts are able to find the right part to fit their vehicle. We also continue to expand our eBay Refurbished offering, a dedicated destination that brings inventory from pre-selected brands and top rated sellers with standardized condition grading, to meet consumer demand for top products backed by a warranty.  Our Impact and Responsibility  eBay\u2019s purpose is to empower people and create economic opportunity for all through our technology for our global community of users. Every day, people build businesses on our Marketplace platforms. With a low cost of entry for sellers, we offer a highly accessible way for all types of users to interact in a global marketplace that\u2019s inclusive and connects people of all backgrounds. Accordingly, we prioritize our corporate responsibility efforts to impact the areas of economic empowerment and sustainable commerce. Key economic programs include eBay for Charity, the eBay Foundation and our small business enablement efforts, such as our Up & Running Grants program.   eBay for Charity empowers buyers and sellers to support charities around the world. In 2022, eBay for Charity matched donations made to Nova Ukraine, Save the Children and the American Red Cross, and partnered with GLIDE for the 21st and final Power of One Luncheon with Warren Buffett, raising $19\u00a0million for the GLIDE Foundation. In 2022, more than $163\u00a0million was raised by buyers and sellers to support charities via eBay for Charity.  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents The eBay Foundation helps to build economically vibrant and thriving communities. During 2022, the eBay Foundation granted nearly $23\u00a0million to support historically excluded entrepreneurs and through our employee gift-matching program. The eBay Foundation also saw record-level amounts of employee giving through our employee gift-matching program and a reimagined employee volunteer and giving program. To date, the eBay Foundation has awarded more than $100\u00a0million to more than 1,800 nonprofits.   Recommerce has been an integral part of eBay\u2019s purpose since the Company was founded in 1995. As a pioneer of the circular economy, eBay has created a space where people can buy and sell pre-owned goods. This helps preserve the world\u2019s natural resources and reduces the Company\u2019s carbon footprint by saving on the water and energy typically used in producing new goods while also reducing waste.  eBay continues its work to reach its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025 and remains a carbon neutral company for our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. In our continued efforts to address climate change, we announced an updated carbon reduction goal in 2021 that was approved by the Science Based Target initiative. We are on track to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 90% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and to reduce value chain (scope 3) emissions from downstream transportation and distribution by 20% in the same timeframe. eBay was ranked in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Green Power Partnership National Top 100 and Top 30 Tech & Telecom for the third year. This year, eBay was also recognized for its commitment to sustainability and responsible business by its inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American Indices for the fourth straight year. eBay also scored an A on the CDP Climate Change questionnaire.   Financial Information  We measure our footprint in our addressable market according to GMV. GMV consists of the total value of all paid transactions between users on our Marketplace platforms during the applicable period inclusive of shipping fees and taxes. In 2022, we generated $74 billion in GMV, of which approximately 51 percent was generated outside the U.S. We believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall volume of paid transactions that flow through our Marketplace platforms in a given period.  At the end of 2022, eBay had 134\u00a0million active buyers and approximately 1.7\u00a0billion live listings globally. The term \u201cactive buyer\u201d means, as of any date, all buyer accounts that paid for a transaction on our Marketplace platforms within the previous 12-month period. Buyers may register more than once and, as a result, may have more than one account.  We generate revenue primarily through fees collected on paid sales, inclusive of payment processing and first-party advertising. The majority of our revenue comes from a take rate on the GMV of transactions paid on our Marketplace platforms. We define \u201ctake rate\u201d as net revenues divided by GMV.  Our Marketplace platforms are designed to enable our buyers and sellers to leverage our economies of scale and capital investments, such as in sales and marketing, mobile, customer acquisition, technology innovation and customer service.  Competition  We encounter vigorous competition in our business from numerous sources. Our users can list, sell, buy, and pay for similar items through a variety of competing online, mobile and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, directories, search engines, commerce participants (consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and business-to-business), shopping channels and networks. As our product offerings continue to broaden into new categories of items and new commerce formats, we expect to face additional competition from other online, mobile and offline channels for those new offerings. We compete on the basis of price, product selection and services, and global scale.  For more information regarding competitive factors impacting our business, see the information in \u201cItem 1A: Risk Factors\u201d under the captions \u201cSubstantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business\u201d and \u201cWe are subject to regulatory activity under competition laws that could adversely impact our business.\u201d  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Government Regulation  Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations that affect the ecommerce industry in many countries where we operate.   Our business is subject to payments reporting requirements for U.S. sellers as a result of federal legislation. During 2021, legislation was passed requiring all businesses that process payments to issue a Form 1099-K for all sellers who receive more than $600 in net payments in a year, a decrease from the previous reporting threshold of $20,000 and 200 transactions. The Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) recently announced a one-year delay of this rule. As a result, Form 1099-Ks for the new thresholds will be issued beginning in January 2024, subject to potential new federal legislation raising the threshold and/or future IRS action. Tax collection responsibility and the additional costs associated with complex sales and use tax collection, remittance and audit requirements, or reporting, could create additional burdens for buyers and sellers on our websites and mobile platforms.  Legislation requiring increased seller information collection, verification and disclosure for online marketplaces was passed into law in a number of states in 2022. Federal legislation is also being considered by Congress. Increased seller mandates could create additional burdens for sellers on our websites and mobile platforms.  In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law containing provisions effective January 1, 2023, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks, both of which we expect to be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to evaluate its impact as further information becomes available.  The European Union recently enacted the Digital Services Act (the \u201cDSA\u201d), which became effective in November 2022 and will begin to be enforced in early 2024. The DSA imposes legal obligations on online marketplaces operating in Europe, requiring them to verify and ensure the accuracy and disclosure of required information, as well as the safety and authenticity of products posted by third-party merchants. The DSA also enforces new content moderation obligations, notice obligations, advertising restrictions and other requirements on digital platforms that will create additional operational burdens and compliance costs for us.   For more information regarding regulatory risks, see the information in \u201cItem 1A: Risk Factors\u201d under the caption \u201cOur business is subject to extensive and increasing government regulation and oversight, which could adversely impact our business\u201d and \u201cOur business and our sellers and buyers may be subject to sales and other tax regimes in various jurisdictions, which may harm our business.\u201d  Seasonality   We expect transaction activity patterns on our Marketplace platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns. Please see the additional information in \u201cItem 7: Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the caption \u201cSeasonality.\u201d   Technology   The eBay Marketplace uses a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by others. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, buyer, seller and developer tools and transaction processing, database and network applications that help enable our users to reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites. Our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services and automates much of the administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Our infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences.  In support of our commitment to innovation and a better customer experience, we have been on a multi-year evolution to modernize our marketplace. Through technologies like artificial intelligence, we are anticipating the needs of buyers, sellers and developers, empowering entrepreneurs looking to grow their business, and making the platform more accessible to everyone. We aim to create highly personalized and inspiring shopping experiences powered by advanced technologies.  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents For information regarding technology-related risks, see the information in \u201cItem 1A: Risk Factors\u201d under the captions \u201cOur business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and cyberattacks,\u201d \u201cSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of or degradation in the performance of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business\u201d and \u201cNew laws and increasing levels of regulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business.\u201d  Intellectual Property   We regard the protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks (particularly those covering the eBay name), patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.  We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress and trade secret protection is typically expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.  We have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. If we are unable to register or protect our trademarks or domain names, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain names are not registered or protected. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others.  From time to time, third parties have claimed \u2014 and others will likely claim in the future \u2014 that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are typically involved in a number of such legal proceedings at any time. Please see the information in \u201cItem 3: Legal Proceedings\u201d and in \u201cItem 1A: Risk Factors\u201d under the captions \u201cThe listing or sale by our users of certain items, including items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners, such as pirated or counterfeit items, illegal items or items used in an illegal manner may harm our business,\u201d and \u201cWe may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights and face ongoing allegations by third parties that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.\u201d  Human Capital Management  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we employed approximately 11,600 people globally. Approximately 6,800 of our employees were located in the U.S. eBay has robust people-focused programs to support and retain our employees globally and to attract our future employees. Our recruitment, development, compensation and benefits, and wellness programs are designed to reflect our values, ensure eBay\u2019s competitiveness in the market for talent, and be a place that is welcoming and inclusive. eBay\u2019s management is focused on delivering programs that develop and support our people and connect them with our customers, our community, and each other. Given the importance of eBay\u2019s employees to our overall success, in 2022 we expanded the Compensation Committee\u2019s charter to include oversight of the company\u2019s human capital management strategy and practices, including activities such as talent recruitment, development and retention, employee engagement, succession planning, and diversity, equity and inclusion.  Culture  eBay\u2019s purpose to connect people and build communities to create economic opportunity for all continues to serve as the backbone of our culture and generates a sense of pride and commitment to our purpose amongst our employees. We bring this purpose to life through five core beliefs that every eBayer embodies as part of their day-to-day work. These beliefs reflect our shared desire to be part of a company focused on our customers and delivering value while having fun. Our Beliefs are:  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Empower our community \u2022Innovate boldly \u2022Deliver with impact  \u2022Be for everyone \u2022Act with integrity  In addition to our beliefs, there are thoughtful and specifically designed benefits and programs that ensure our people are well cared for, listened to, and supported while at eBay.  Evolving How We Work  We continue to monitor and adapt to workplace changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. As eBay reopened its offices around the globe our employees now have the opportunity to work in one of three models: onsite, remote, or hybrid. We implemented eBay FlexWork to support hybrid workers and continue to provide equipment, systems and resources to facilitate a connected workforce regardless of whether employees are in the office or working from home, including for our customer experience team members who are continuing to work from home in most cases. While we\u2019ve seen an increase in employees that are returning to the office, we\u2019ve maintained programs that we leveraged during the pandemic to provide back-up in-home child and adult care in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany and Ireland to support families and caregivers. In addition, as we continued to hire employees throughout the pandemic, we have reimagined the employee onboarding experience to be more virtual and self-service.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) remains a priority area of focus for eBay. In 2022 we made the decision to get clearer about the outcomes we\u2019re driving towards as it relates to DE&I in service of our commitment to being a richly diverse, truly equitable and fearlessly inclusive place to work, grow, sell and buy. Our four DE&I objectives are to increase representation, cultivate a sense of belonging, engage our communities and allies, and build inclusive technology. Equity remains at the forefront of all we do to hire, grow, and retain top talent, enhance corporate performance, and foster a welcoming and inclusive place to work, learn and grow. We continue to enhance our people processes, leverage actionable data insights, provide ongoing learning and development practices to ensure we move this work forward. Delivering a governance model to ensure that we drive shared accountability throughout the organization remains a priority. Our Communities of Inclusion welcome and connect eBay employees all over the world to help us nurture employees, allies and external communities. They host events and forums to connect employees to groups organized around age, disability status, race/ethnicity, gender, military status, caregiver status, sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression. We are currently preparing our sixth Global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion report for publication in the second quarter of 2023.  Well-Being Support for Employees and Their Families  eBay has continually engaged with our people to support their physical, financial, and mental well-being for them and their families through expanded wellness resources, webinars, telehealth access and expansion of company-paid mental health support globally as well as additional training for managers and peers to support mental health and manage burnout. As part of these efforts, we\u2019ve focused on ensuring our employees and their families have timely access to high quality care.   In addition to competitive pay and benefits, eBay offers additional parental time off beyond what is required by law in the U.S. and in most countries where we operate. This benefit is offered for parents welcoming a new child into the family whether by giving birth, adopting or welcoming a child through surrogacy. This is an important demonstration of our commitment to working parents and their families.  Acting with Integrity  We maintained our commitment to ethics and acting with integrity in 2022. We took actions to ensure that we are open, honest, ethical and authentic with ongoing trainings, quarterly \u201ctone from the top\u201d engagements between leaders with their employees and daily ethics contests during Ethics and Compliance Week.   9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Employee Voice & Values  In addition to multiple channels for sharing feedback, we also regularly survey our employees on trust and engagement, their experience with diversity, equity and inclusion, ethics and integrity, and this year regarding their thoughts on returning to the office. Our employees welcome sharing their points of view with us and are encouraged by how their input molds several strategic programs and our values which covers our beliefs and includes our commitments in critical areas such as Impact and Responsibility.
