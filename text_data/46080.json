(\u201cHasbro\u201d) is a global Branded Entertainment leader whose mission is to entertain and connect generations of fans through the wonder of storytelling and exhilaration of play.  Hasbro delivers engaging brand experiences for global audiences through gaming, consumer products and entertainment, with a portfolio of iconic brands including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, Hasbro Gaming, NERF, TRANSFORMERS, PLAY-DOH and PEPPA PIG, as well as premier partner brands. Hasbro is guided by our purpose to create joy and community for all people around the world, one game, one toy, one story at a time. For more than a decade, we have been consistently recognized for our corporate citizenship, including being named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL Media, one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute and one of the 50 Most Community-Minded Companies in the U.S. by the Civic 50.  Recent Developments Fiscal year 2022 was a challenging year for Hasbro.  We navigated through a difficult global economy with high inflation and rising interest rates, a challenged toy and game industry, the continued effects of the coronavirus pandemic and leadership changes, as we embarked upon a multi-year transformational effort to support our revamped Blueprint 2.0 strategy described below. Executive Leadership Effective February 25, 2022 we appointed Christian (Chris) Cocks as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Cocks previously served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Hasbro\u2019s Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming division. In February 2022, we appointed Cynthia Williams as President of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming.  Ms. Williams joined us from Microsoft, where she most recently served as General Manager and Vice President, Gaming Ecosystem Commercial Team, and drove the expansion of Xbox Gaming and the acceleration of game-creator growth. Prior to joining Microsoft, Ms. Williams spent more than a decade at Amazon, where she led the global growth of their ecommerce direct-to-consumer business Fulfillment by Amazon. In April 2022, we appointed Shane Azzi as our Chief Global Supply Chain Officer, and Matthew Austin as our Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Azzi has more than 25 years of consumer packaged goods and diverse  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents supply chain experience, most recently with Kimberly-Clark. Mr. Austin was promoted from within Hasbro and is focused on leveraging our commercial operations with powerful, data-driven consumer insights and strategic partnership, across different channels, including e-commerce and direct fan experience.  In May 2022, we appointed Najuma Atkinson as our Chief People Officer, to lead our Global HR function. Ms. Atkinson joined us from Dell Technologies, where she served as Senior Vice President of Global HR Services.  In November 2022, we announced that Deborah Thomas informed Hasbro of her intent to retire from her position as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer after 24 years of distinguished service and leadership with the Company. Hasbro initiated a search process to identify her successor and Ms. Thomas and Hasbro plan for her to remain as Chief Financial Officer until her successor is in place, and remain as an advisor to the Company for a period thereafter, to ensure a smooth transition. In January 2023, we announced that Eric Nyman, President and Chief Operating Officer since February 2022, will be leaving the Company effective March 31, 2023. Strategic Review On October 4, 2022, following a several months long strategic review of our business led by our CEO, we announced a go-forward strategic plan guided by our new Blueprint 2.0, a consumer-centric framework for bringing compelling and expansive brand experiences to audiences around the world. During our review we identified opportunities to focus and scale our business, enhance operational excellence, including through specialized organizational programs and supply chain transformation, to drive growth and profit and enhance shareholder value. We plan to increase strategic investment on our most valuable and profitable franchises across toys, games, entertainment and licensing, and exit certain non-core aspects of the business. Our Blueprint 2.0 transformation is guided by five strategic pillars: Brand, Insights and Entertainment; Direct and Digital; Licensing; Operational Excellence; and People. Brand, Insights and Entertainment \u2022Focus on fewer, bigger, more profitable brands and driving market share in the key categories of preschool, games, creativity, outdoor and action brands. \u2022Develop our insights and analytics capabilities heavily focused on putting consumers at the center of everything we do, as we build multi-generational brands. \u2022Entertainment investments focused on Hasbro IP aligned with our Blueprint 2.0 strategy including merchandise and digital engagement opportunities with a focus on franchise brands. Direct and Digital \u2022Invest in our Hasbro direct-to-consumer and digital business, inclusive of Hasbro PULSE, SECRET LAIR, Magic: The Gathering Arena and D&D Beyond. An example of this investment includes our acquisition of D&D Beyond (the \"D&D Beyond Acquisition\"), the premier digital content platform for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, in the second quarter of 2022, in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of $146.3 million. The D&D Beyond Acquisition is expected to substantially accelerate direct-to-fans capability for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS in physical and digital play.  \u2022Continue to cultivate digital licensing relationships that activate our brands. Licensing \u2022Scale licensing of our brands through a growing portfolio of partners from theme park operators to toy companies, for consumers to experience our brands and drive communities of friendship and fandom around them. Operational Excellence \u2022Execute operational savings initiatives, including supply chain transformation, to improve operating results and reinvest in our business. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents People \u2022Invest in our people at all levels of our organization and continue to foster a diverse and inclusive culture that drives accountability and focuses on profitability. Hasbro Transformation Office Under our new strategic plan, we launched the Hasbro Transformation Office (HTO), a team of leaders dedicated to running a disciplined, purpose-built company that is simpler, more efficient and redesigned to drive long-term sustainable growth in markets in which we compete. Our HTO aligns and delivers on our Operational Excellence program, an enterprise-wide cost-saving initiative intended to improve our business financially, operationally and culturally from our current state and designed to deliver $250 million to $300 million in run-rate cost savings by the end of 2025, $50 million of which was achieved in full-year 2022 with $20 million of actualized savings. TV and Film Business On November 17, 2022, we announced an authorization by Hasbro's Board of Directors to initiate a marketing for parts of our eOne TV and film business that do not directly support the Company\u2019s Branded Entertainment strategy. In the event a transaction were to occur, Hasbro is expected to maintain the capability to develop and produce animation, digital shorts, scripted TV and theatrical films for audiences related to core Hasbro IP. The family brands business, including the brands PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS, is not expected to be part of any transaction involving parts of the eOne film and television business. The Company anticipates that the process will take several months however, there can be no assurance that the process will result in a sale. Workforce Reduction In alignment with the objectives of our Operational Excellence program, on January 26, 2023, we announced the undertaking of certain organizational changes resulting in the elimination of approximately 1,000 positions from our global workforce in 2023, or approximately 15% of global full-time employees. Coronavirus Pandemic Since the onset of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in early 2020, our business has been adversely impacted by the challenges and risks associated with both the initial, and the continuing effects of the spread of the virus worldwide. Certain effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including difficulties in shipping and distributing products due to constraints in port capacity, shipping containers and truck transportation, continued into 2022. These and other disruptions led to higher costs for both ocean and air freight and delays in the availability of products, which resulted in delayed sales and, in some cases, lost sales. In response to these and other challenges, we developed and executed plans to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 to our business, which we believe helped to manage the adverse impacts to our financial results for fiscal year 2022. For example, the Company implemented certain price increases during 2022 and 2021, to mitigate product input and freight cost increases. Additionally, during the first half of 2022, the Company accelerated certain inventory purchases to ensure sufficient finished goods and raw material availability, ahead of expected periods of high consumer demand due to supply chain constraints. These purchases, however, did not see corresponding increases in sales as consumers were impacted by the economic environment, including lower discretionary consumer income due to higher inflation and rising interest rates, driving higher inventory balances within certain markets as compared to prior year. As a result, the Company launched incremental year-over-year advertising and promotional activity behind key holiday toy and game items to drive our newest innovation and reduce inventory on hand at Hasbro and at retail. Since the initial COVID-19 outbreak, we have maintained sufficient liquidity and access to capital resources and we continue to closely monitor customer health and collectability of receivables.  The impact of coronavirus outbreak continues to be fluid and uncertain and it is still difficult to forecast the final or ongoing impact it could have on our future operations.

Risk Factors, in this Form 10-K for further information. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Blueprint 2.0 Our strategic plan has long been centered around the Hasbro Blueprint, a framework for bringing compelling and expansive brand experiences to consumers and audiences around the world. With the evolution of our strategy comes a new Blueprint 2.0, a consumer-centric framework where our brands are transformed as story-led and play-led consumer franchises brought to life through games, play and experiences and offered across a multitude of platforms and media. Our commitment to disciplined, strategic investments, when activated across our Blueprint 2.0 differentiates Hasbro as a purpose-driven business with diversified capabilities focused on driving profitable growth and enhancing shareholder value.  Hasbro's purpose of creating joy and community for all people around the world, one game, one toy, one story at a time starts with consumers and our fans, who represent multigenerational audiences that sit at the center of Blueprint 2.0. Understanding our fans, expanding our fan base and delivering for them is the key driver behind our evolution as a Branded Entertainment company. The development and execution of our brands are informed by our brand insights platform, a proprietary consumer insights and data analytics system which helps us understand the behavior of our consumers. We have learned that consumers will travel with a brand that they love across multiple forms and formats, including our core historical strength of toys and games and licensed consumer products, as well as digital gaming and story-led entertainment and experiences. The value of Hasbro is fully activated when we can take a brand across multiple elements of Blueprint 2.0 including consumer products such as toys, games and licensed products; digital gaming; entertainment and experiences; and our Hasbro Direct business. The ability to build a brand and leverage in-house capabilities to create multiple categories of engagement with consumers and fans is unique to Hasbro and optimizes our economics today and in the future. Below is a summary of key areas of focus for activating our brands across Blueprint 2.0. \u2022Toys and Games. We market and sell toys and games based on our owned and controlled brands globally at retail stores, through ecommerce platforms and through our fan-based direct-to-consumer platforms Hasbro PULSE and SECRET LAIR. Additionally, through license agreements with third parties, we develop and sell products based on popular third-party brands through these channels. Our toys and games include action figures, arts and crafts and creative play products, dolls, play sets, preschool toys, plush products, sports action blasters and accessories, vehicles and toy-related specialty products, games and many other consumer products which represent an array of internationally recognizable brands that capture the imagination of our consumers worldwide.  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Within toys and games, as a leading producer of new and innovative gaming brands and play experiences, our gaming business continues to transform game play. To successfully execute our gaming strategy, we consider brands which capitalize on existing trends while evolving our approach using consumer insights and data analytics and offering gaming experiences addressed to consumer demand for face-to-face, trading card and digital game experiences played as board, off-the-board, digital, card, electronic, trading card and role-playing games.  Our subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast (\u201cWizards\u201d), is a critical part of our gaming business, driving innovation and growth through its popular role-playing and fantasy card-collecting games such as MAGIC: THE GATHERING, Hasbro's first billion-dollar brand which benefited from numerous tent-pole set releases exceeding $100.0 million per set during 2022, and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Our iconic game brands include long-time favorites such as MONOPOLY, JENGA, CONNECT 4, THE GAME OF LIFE, SCRABBLE, CLUE and TRIVIAL PURSUIT, as well as many other well-known game brands. \u2022Licensed Consumer Products. As a complement to our toy and game business, we promote our brands through the out-licensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in a wide range of consumer products. These include apparel, publishing, home goods and electronics, or in certain situations, toy products where the out-licensing of brands is more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves. We also out-license our brands for uses in theme park attractions and other forms of location-based entertainment. In cases where we license our intellectual property to a third party, we enter into contracts with licensees that pay us either a sales-based or usage-based royalty, or a combination of both, for use of the brands, and, in some cases, the license arrangements are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts or fixed fees, over the term of the license. As we continue our Blueprint 2.0 transformation efforts focusing on fewer, bigger brands, we have begun out-licensing certain non-core brands which we believe may be more profitable through a licensing arrangement. \u2022Digital Gaming. A key element of Blueprint 2.0 is continued growth of our digital gaming business to further unlock the value of our brands through play and storytelling. This includes the D&D Beyond acquisition in 2022 and the ongoing development of digital games internally and through third parties. For example, we have developed and launched digital versions of the MAGIC: THE GATHERING card game, including Magic: The Gathering Arena and related mobile application, which also complement the Company's direct-to-customer relationships. Additionally, through Wizards we launched Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance, a team-based action role-playing game, set in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS world, released in the first half of 2021 for PC and gaming consoles. We also out-license certain of our brands to other third-party digital game developers who transform Hasbro brand-based characters and other intellectual properties, into digital gaming experiences. \u2022Entertainment. A critical driver of Blueprint 2.0 is to reinforce storylines associated with our brands through entertainment mediums, including television, film, digital content and other programming. Our entertainment business, through eOne, is a global independent studio specializing in the development, production, distribution and sales of entertainment content. With our cross-platform capabilities our entertainment business leverages film and television production and sales, digital content and children's programming to create compelling entertainment and drive creativity across brands with merchandising and licensing tie-ins. \u25e6Film and Television. Our go-forward focus is on the development, production and co-production of content based upon Hasbro brands. Our film content is exploited on a multi\u2011territory basis across all media channels, including cinema, home entertainment, broadcast and digital, including Subscription Video\u2011On\u2011Demand (\"SVOD\"). Our original television programming is sold to broadcasters on a series\u2011by\u2011series or individual show basis for broadcast on free television, pay television, SVOD and other digital platforms. Our programming spans a variety of genres, including scripted drama, non\u2011scripted reality and documentaries, and in multiple formats, including series, television films, mini\u2011series and specials. In October 2017, we entered into an agreement with Paramount Pictures (\u201cParamount\u201d) to produce and distribute live action and animated films, as well as television programming based on Hasbro brands. Hasbro plays an active role alongside Paramount in content development, production and distribution in addition to the financing of films created through these cooperative agreements. Under this relationship we plan to release Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, expected in early 2023 to be distributed by Paramount and eOne. In addition, under a  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents separate agreement entered with Paramount, we plan to release Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, a feature length film expected in Summer of 2023. \u25e6Family Brands Animation. Our family brands team develops, produces and distributes animation content for children\u2019s properties on a worldwide basis which results in multiple touchpoints across Blueprint 2.0. The principal brands include MY LITTLE PONY and PEPPA PIG whose content entertains children worldwide and generates revenues through licensing and merchandising programs across multiple retail categories. These brands generate revenues from Advertising Video-On-Demand (\u201cAVOD\u201d) through platforms such as YouTube and SVOD revenues from the sale of content to video streaming platforms. Our portfolio of preschool brand driven content also includes PJ MASKS, BABY ALIVE and PLAY-DOH and the development of new preschool programs and properties. \u2022Hasbro Direct. We are investing in our Hasbro Direct business which is our \"Fans Come First\" approach to creating direct connections with our consumers and includes the following platforms: \u25e6Hasbro PULSE - Hasbro's ultimate fan ecommerce destination. At Hasbro Pulse our fans can find product offerings and experiences from our popular brands as well as access to views of behind-the-scenes material and insider details. In addition, Hasbro Pulse offers consumers access to product related livestreams such as fan oriented virtual conventions and product and merchandise reveals, as well as the opportunity to participate in HasLab, the Hasbro crowdfunding platform which brings limited-edition collectibles into the hands of fans. \u25e6SECRET LAIR - our internet-based storefront where MAGIC: THE GATHERING fans can purchase exclusive and limited versions of cards. \u25e6Magic: The Gathering Arena - the free-to-play online adaptation of the MAGIC: THE GATHERING card game. \u25e6D&D Beyond - the premier digital content platform for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS.  \u2022Other Blueprint 2.0 Areas. Other aspects of our Blueprint 2.0 that help drive our storytelling experiences include digital content, location-based entertainment, and publishing. \u25e6Digital Content. We understand the importance of digital content to drive fan engagement, including in gaming and across other media, and of integrating such content with our products. Digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for traditional products through the use of complementary digital applications, social media and websites which extend storylines and enhance play. \u25e6Location-Based Entertainment. Location-based entertainment (\u201cLBE\u201d) allows consumers to experience and share our brands. LBE includes licensing our brands to theme parks, water parks, hotels and resorts, family entertainment centers, retail, dining and entertainment, shows, exhibits and exhibitions. These experiences bring our brands to life and further immerse our consumers in our storytelling in a capital efficient manner.  \u25e6Publishing. Licensing our brands to global publishers is another way to bring our brands to consumers in a meaningful way through various publishing formats, from puzzle and trivia books to children's stories, adult novels and comics. 11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Blueprint 2.0 in Action. Some examples of our Blueprint 2.0 in action are described below. \u25e6PEPPA PIG is a franchise brand that we have expanded across multiple elements of Blueprint 2.0. Initially acquired in 2020 through the eOne acquisition, and brought to life through the launch of the first Hasbro toys and games for this leading preschool brand in August 2021. Although we shifted from licensed revenue when acquired, to in-sourced revenue for toys and games, we were able to grow related licensed consumer products revenue, and PEPPA PIG was one of our top growth brands overall in 2022. This growth highlights the awareness and global reach of the PEPPA PIG brand across these categories and others including digital content, publishing, location-based live entertainment and theme parks. \u25e6Within our gaming portfolio we have assembled one of the biggest, most profitable and fastest growing combinations of gaming brands across face-to-face, tabletop and digital platforms in the world. MAGIC: THE GATHERING, Hasbro's first billion-dollar brand, and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS are two prominent brands that have generated sustained growth with high fan enthusiasm and engagement. We have leveraged the power of these Wizards\u2019 brands across Blueprint 2.0 for consumers as we continue their development and invest in their growth. In addition to popular tabletop and digital games, we have the theatrical release of the feature film Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, expected in March 2023 and we have new MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS television series in development. We believe these efforts will harness the full potential of Blueprint 2.0 where programming attracts the existing multi-generational fan-base, helps to acquire new fans and supports our lineup of consumer products that include specialty games, apparel, accessories and collectibles, as well as publishing that spans children's books to adult novels. As location-based entertainment continues to expand at retail, it provides a platform where fans can play and further experience these brands. \u25e6Our Hasbro Direct business allows us to connect directly with consumers. With a focus on the adult fan and being developed based on the successes of Hasbro Pulse, our original direct-to-consumer fan-based ecommerce platform, we are currently developing a single destination where fans can access all things Hasbro including products, services and unique experiences. With the recent addition of D&D Beyond along with our Secret Lair web-based storefront for MAGIC: THE GATHERING cards and our Magic the Gathering: Arena digital game, we are expanding our capabilities beyond the traditional ecommerce outlet to serve our consumers and activate brands across Blueprint 2.0. Connecting with fans directly enables us to showcase and sell brands and gain a deeper understanding of our fans and what they want and expect from Hasbro. 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Brand Portfolios In 2022, we organized and marketed owned, controlled and licensed intellectual properties within our brand architecture under the following five brand portfolios:  \u2022Franchise Brands  \u2022Partner Brands  \u2022Hasbro Gaming  \u2022Emerging Brands  \u2022TV/Film/Entertainment  Brand PortfolioKey BrandsDescription and Significant DevelopmentsFranchise Brands\u2022MAGIC: THE GATHERING\u2022NERF\u2022PLAY-DOH\u2022PEPPA PIG\u2022TRANSFORMERS\u2022MONOPOLY\u2022MY LITTLE PONY\u2022BABY ALIVEIncludes our flagship owned or controlled brands, which we believe can deliver significant revenues, profits and growth over the long term.\u2022In 2022, MAGIC: THE GATHERING benefited from a number of successful card set releases including Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, Double Masters 2022, Dominaria United, Streets of New Capenna, Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate and The Brother's War.\u2022The PEPPA PIG brand growth was supported by a full year of revenue from Hasbro\u2019s own PEPPA PIG product line, launched in the second half of 2021.\u2022In November 2022, partnering with Nickelodeon and Paramount, we released the computer-animated television series Transformers: EarthSpark on Paramount+, as well as a new related TRANSFORMERS  product line.\u2022PLAY-DOH holiday feature item Play-Doh Ice Cream Truck was a strong performer in 2022.Partner Brands\u2022MARVEL, including SPIDER-MAN and THE AVENGERS(1)\u2022LUCASFILMS' STAR WARS(1)\u2022BEYBLADE\u2022FORTNITE\u2022GHOST BUSTERS\u2022INDIANA JONES(1)(1)Owned by The Walt Disney Company (\u201cDisney\u201d).Includes those brands we license from other parties for which we develop toy and game products.

Brand Portfolio Realignment Effective for the first quarter 2023, we are realigning our brand portfolios to correspond with the evolution of our Blueprint 2.0 strategy.

Our new product categories beginning in the first quarter of 2023 are as follows:  \u25e6Franchise Brands - A refreshed group of our most profitable brands that includes PEPPA PIG, TRANSFORMERS, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, PLAY-DOH, NERF and HASBRO GAMING as a whole.  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u25e6Partner Brands - The Partner Brands category will continue to include those brands we license from other parties such as Disney's STAR WARS and MARVEL as well as other partners, for which we develop toy and game products, however we intend to concentrate on those key Partner Brands that give us the biggest growth potential and where we can lead and innovate in the category. \u25e6Portfolio Brands - Our Portfolio Brands category will include those brands we own or control which we feel have upside in revenue and profitability that have not yet grown to the significance of a franchise brand. Reportable Segments In 2022, our four reportable segments were: \u2022Consumer Products \u2022Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming \u2022Entertainment \u2022Corporate and Other 15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents SegmentDescription of SegmentConsumer Products\u2022Engages in the sourcing, marketing and sales of toy and game products around the world.

These sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment, to which the sale relates. \u25e6Certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence. \u25e6For more financial and geographic information regarding our segments, please see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K. Working Capital Requirements; Seasonality Our working capital needs are financed through available cash and cash generated from operations, primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing and entertainment operations, and, when necessary, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under our revolving credit agreement. In the event the Company is not able to issue commercial paper, we intend to utilize our available lines of credit.  In addition, the Company\u2019s Entertainment operating segment uses production financing to fund certain of its television and film productions which are typically arranged on an individual production basis by either special purpose production subsidiaries or through a senior revolving credit facility obtained in November 2021, dedicated to production financing. Our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines, supply and product availability, marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers, TV and film content releases, including the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products, and changes in overall economic conditions. As a result, a disproportionate volume of our net revenues from our consumer products business has historically been earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industry\u2019s holiday selling season, including Christmas. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, quick response or just-in-time inventory management practices being used by retailers, along with growth in ecommerce resulted in the increasing trend of order placement for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. Retailers preferred timing their orders for fulfillment by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. To the extent that retailers did not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during the holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year could be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Company\u2019s future revenues. However, more recently the Company's inventory levels and retailer order patterns reflect the impact of global supply chain disruptions, which began in late 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its after-effects. During the first half of 2022, the Company accelerated certain inventory purchases, to ensure sufficient finished goods and raw material availability ahead of expected periods of high consumer demand. However, during the third quarter of 2022, as the effects of supply chain disruptions began to subside, most notably in the U.S, and Europe, the accelerated inventory purchases did not see corresponding increases in sales as consumers were impacted by the economic environment, including lower discretionary consumer income due to higher inflation and rising interest rates, leading to higher inventory levels as compared to prior years. As a result, the Company launched incremental year-over-year promotional activity behind key holiday toy and game items to reduce inventory on hand and at retail and is continuing to manage inventory levels to ensure adequate supply of new product while clearing excess supply to mitigate the risk of inventory obsolescence. In 2022 and 2021, the second half of the year accounted for approximately 57% and 62% of full year revenues, respectively, with the third and fourth quarters accounting for approximately 28% and 29%, respectively, of full year net revenues in 2022 and 31% of full year revenues in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2021. In 2021 and continuing into periods of 2022, supply chain constraints, including overcrowding of cargo ports and shipping container and truck transportation shortages led to higher costs for ocean, air and over the road freight and delays in the availability of products, due to extended inventory transit times. Historically, we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year, prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season. Our accounts receivable balances typically increase during the third and fourth quarters as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these  17 17 17 Table of Contents Table of Contents accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. The timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year, however, we have had sufficient liquidity and capital resources throughout 2022 and 2021 and have not had to borrow under our revolving credit facility. Our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of film, television, streaming and digital content releases, which are often determined based on the timing of prime television seasons, certain geographic release dates and competition in the market.  Product Development and Royalties Development Our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our play and entertainment offerings and requires ongoing development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance. Our toy and game products are developed by a global development function, the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments. These costs include activities related to the development, design and engineering of new products and their packaging and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products. Much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers, artists, model makers and engineers.  Development and related costs associated with Wizards of the Coast products are specifically allocated to that line of business, including investments in tabletop and digital gaming initiatives as well as those planned for release in the coming years. In addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff, we work with a number of independent toy and game designers, and compete for their designs and ideas with other toy and game manufacturers. Rights to such designs and ideas, when acquired or licensed by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item. These designer royalty agreements may also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees. Royalties and Participations We also produce an array of products under licenses based on our partners\u2019 trademarks and copyrights for the names or likenesses of characters from movies, television shows and other entertainment media. We compete with other toy and game manufacturers for these licensed rights and we refer to our products produced under these arrangements as Partner Brands. Licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item. Licenses for the use of characters may be exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories, or may be non-exclusive, in which case our product offerings may be competing with the product offerings of other licensees. In many instances, advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements. Our royalty expense in any given year may vary depending upon product mix and the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media. Our entertainment offerings also require us to pay royalties and participations to those involved in the creation of the content, such as producers, writers, directors and actors. Marketing and Sales, Customer Concentration and Advertising Marketing and Sales  While our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and re-invention, our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs. The global marketing group works cross-functionally with the global development function to deliver unified, brand-specific consumer experiences. The costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments. In addition to the global marketing function, our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution. Our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers, including mass-market retailers, distributors, wholesalers, discount stores, specialty hobby stores, drug stores, mail order houses, catalog stores, department stores and other traditional retailers, large and small, as well as ecommerce retailers and direct-to-customer through our fan-focused Hasbro Direct business. Our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who, for the most part, sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence. The majority of our product sales are to large chain stores, distributors, e-retailers and wholesalers. 18 18 18 Table of Contents Table of Contents Customer Concentration During 2022, net revenues from our top five retail customers accounted for approximately 35% of our consolidated global net revenues, including our largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Amazon.com who represented 11% and 10%, respectively, of consolidated global net revenues. Net revenues from the Company\u2019s major customers are reported within the Consumer Products segment, Wizards of the Coast & Digital Gaming segment and the Entertainment segment. Ecommerce sales continues to represent a significant portion of overall sales to these customers as consumers are continuing to purchase more products online compared to pre-pandemic levels. Please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of risks relating to customer concentration. Advertising We advertise many of our products extensively and brands through digital marketing and on television. Products are strategically cross promoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item, but also those complementary products.  As described earlier, our Blueprint 2.0 strategy includes focusing on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several mediums, including television, film, digital gaming and live action experiences. Our brands obtain marketing and advertising support through entertainment appearing on major networks globally, theatrical releases as well as on various other digital platforms, such as Netflix and Apple TV.  A recent example of this was the November 2022 release of the computer-animated television series Transformers: EarthSpark on Paramount+ in partnership with Nickelodeon and Paramount. Many of our new toy and game products are introduced to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction. Our advertising expenditures are impacted by our product mix in any given year. For example, brands based on major motion picture releases generally require less advertising as a result of the promotional activities around the motion picture release, whereas leading into a major digital gaming launch, our Wizards of the Coast business will have substantial increases to advertising, marketing and promotional expenses to acquire players and promote gaming releases. Producing, marketing and distributing films and television programming can involve significant costs and the timing of a film\u2019s release can cause our financial results to vary. For instance, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. Therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film\u2019s theatrical release and profitability for the film may not be realized until after its theatrical release window. Supply Chain and Manufacturing Beginning in early 2020 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and continuing into 2022, we experienced disruptions to supply of our products, initially due to closures of third-party manufacturing facilities across several geographies, primarily in early 2020, and reductions in manufacturing facility operations across multiple geographies. Additionally, we experienced difficulties in shipping and distributing certain products due to supply chain constraints, including overcrowding of cargo ports and shipping container and truck transportation shortages which led to higher costs for ocean, air and over the road freight and delays in the availability of products, due to extended inventory transit times. These challenges have at times caused delays in the availability of products, which in some instances have led to delayed sales and in certain cases, lost sales. The impact to our business from these and other disruptions continued into 2022. However, despite these adverse manufacturing and supply chain conditions, at this time, we believe the manufacturing capacity of our third-party manufacturers, as well as the supply of components, accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers, are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2023 for our products. Additionally, during 2021 and 2022 in response to global supply chain disruptions, we expanded shipping capacity, activated alternate ports in China and the U.S. and we have prioritized supply based on inventory and customer needs, including the utilization of air freight when needed. However, if global supply chain challenges worsen, or we or our suppliers suffer prolonged manufacturing disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the coronavirus, manufacturing capacity of our third-party manufacturers as well as supply of components, accessories and our products may be adversely impacted. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K for further information. Beginning in late 2022, as part of Hasbro's new go-forward strategic plan we launched a multi-year initiative aimed at transforming our global supply chain into a best-in-class network which we expect to deliver competitive advantages through performance efficiency, operating model integration and organizational accountability. Aligned with the Operational Excellence pillar of our Blueprint 2.0 transformation, we are refining all aspects of our  19 19 19 Table of Contents Table of Contents integrated supply chain from planning and designing to sourcing and delivering, with a multi-year plan to deliver improved capabilities and provide a productivity pipeline to fuel growth at Hasbro. During 2022, the majority of our products were manufactured in third-party facilities in the Far East, primarily China, Vietnam and India, using a Hong Kong based wholly-owned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes. Within the U.S. and Ireland, we utilize two previously owned facilities now operated by Cartamundi, which are located in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland, to manufacture significant quantities of Hasbro game products. We have diversified our global sourcing mix and decreased our dependence on Chinese manufacturing in recent years by increasing production of our products in other countries, including Vietnam and India. Most of our toys and games are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic, paper and cardboard, although certain products also use electronic components. All of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price. There are certain chemicals (including phthalates and BPA) that national, state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of; however, we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business. We generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year. However, significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year. Competition We are a worldwide leader in the development, design, sale and marketing of toys and games and entertainment offerings, operating in a highly competitive business environment. We compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories, as well as with many smaller United States and international toy and game designers, manufacturers and marketers. In certain instances, we also compete with large retailers, who offer such products under their own private labels, often at lower prices. In addition, we compete with digital gaming developers, who focus primarily on digital gaming products. We compete with other companies that offer TV and film content and branded entertainment specific to children and their families. Given the ease of entry into our business we view our primary competition as coming from toy and game companies, digital gaming providers and content providers who are creating play and entertainment experiences that compete with our brand-driven storytelling and product experiences for consumer attention and spending. Businesses that create compelling content can readily translate that content into a full range of product offerings. Competition is based primarily on meeting consumer preferences and on the quality and play value of our products and experiences. To a lesser extent, competition is also based on product pricing. Our entertainment business competes with other companies that produce and distribute films, television programs and other entertainment content. For example, eOne, as an independent distributor and content producer, competes with other major U.S. and international studios that historically have released a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office and streaming revenues and television airtime, as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies. Many of the major U.S. studios are part of large, diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations, including television networks and cable channels that can provide both in-house distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations. Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office revenues and television airtime or streaming placement. In addition, the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including content libraries, that we might also be interested in acquiring. The competition we face may cause us to lose market share, achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third party content, any of which could harm our business. Additionally, the Discovery Family Channel, our cable television joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. in the U.S., competes with a number of other children\u2019s television networks for viewers, advertising revenue and distribution fees. In addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and entertainment and storytelling companies, we contend with the expanding variety of digital gaming and digital entertainment offerings available for children, while product life cycles of traditional toys and games have shortened. As a result, our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment, we also compete, particularly in meeting the demands of older children, with entertainment offerings of many technology companies, such as makers of tablets, mobile devices, video games and other digital gaming products and screens, and social media companies. 20 20 20 Table of Contents Table of Contents The changing trends in consumer preferences with respect to entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies and different mediums for viewing content, such as the growing number of streaming platform options, continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups to develop products and offerings that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings. Environment, Social and Governance Performance  Overview At Hasbro, we believe strong Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) performance drives long-term value creation for our business and stakeholders. The following discusses ESG governance and our ESG focus areas and priorities. Governance ESG governance starts with our Board of Directors (Board), with specific oversight by our Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee of the Board (Governance Committee). ESG topics, such as climate, human rights and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I), are regular agenda items at Governance Committee meetings. The Governance Committee analyzes these issues and makes recommendations to the full Board. In addition, the Audit Committee of our Board oversees SEC and public disclosures in specific areas like conflict minerals, climate and sustainability, and enterprise risk. Through our Compensation Committee, the Board considers ESG performance and priorities when determining the plan design for compensation, and overall performance of our senior executives. The full Board receives regular updates regarding our ESG progress. In addition to Board-level governance, our CEO and the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) regularly review our ESG performance, progress and opportunities. Our ESG Committee, chaired by our Chief Purpose Officer and comprised of our ELT, meets several times a year to ensure rigorous management oversight of the Company\u2019s ESG strategy, impact and performance. The Chief Purpose Officer, together with our Chief Legal Officer and other members of our ELT, set the direction for our global ESG strategy and performance, and ensure the integration of ESG throughout the organization and supply chain. Building on Our Progress and Reaching New Heights ESG at Hasbro is the framework for translating our Company\u2019s Purpose into action \u2013 getting from \u201cwhy\u201d we exist to \u201chow\u201d we deliver sustainable, long-term value for our Company and stakeholders. We continue to integrate ESG across our business and are proud of our strategic initiatives that are intended to further our purpose and make a positive impact for our employees, consumers, investors, and planet. Below are some ESG highlights from 2022:  21 21 21 Table of Contents Table of Contents Recent recognition for Hasbro\u2019s leadership in promoting and advancing the interests of our stakeholders, our communities and our planet include:  Focus Area: Climate and Environment  Carbon Reduction: \u2022We recognize the impact our business can have on the environment and are working to reduce our footprint. We view sustainability challenges as opportunities to innovate and to continuously improve our product design and operational efficiencies. We believe the long-term viability and health of our operations and our supply chain, and the potential for environmental improvements, are important components to our business success. \u2022In January 2022, we committed to set greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reductions with a near-term 2030 goal, based on limiting emissions to keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, and a long-term 2050 goal, based on net-zero emissions across our value chain. In joining the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi), we expect to leverage a globally accepted methodology for setting GHG reduction targets in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. \u2022We continue to invest in renewable electricity. To address the carbon footprint associated with electricity consumption of our owned and operated facilities, Hasbro purchases Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), each of which represent one megawatt hour (MWh) of renewable energy generated on the same grid as our electricity consumption. We purchase RECs to cover virtually 100% of the electricity consumed in each market where available. The amount of money we have spent in this area has been de minimis.  For example, in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, we purchased $72K, $100K, and $45K of RECs, respectively. Other key goals and objectives in this area include: \u2022Waste Reduction: Continue to minimize virgin plastic in single-use disposable toy and game packaging, where feasible. \u2022Circular Economy: Continue our industry-first toy recycling program (currently in 12 countries) in partnership with TerraCycle, a leader in product recycling outside of municipal recycling. 22 22 22 Table of Contents Table of Contents Climate Risk and Resilience:  \u2022Managing the resilience of our business to the potential risks of climate change is a priority. We are working to further integrate climate risk and resilience into our overall enterprise risk management (ERM) process. \u2022In 2022, we initiated work to evaluate the integration of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework into our existing ERM process across four key areas: governance, risk management, strategy and metrics & targets. The TCFD framework will identify potential climate risks, guide management of those potential risks and measure the effectiveness of our mitigation measures. Focus Area: Human Rights and Ethical Sourcing  \u2022Our Human Rights and Ethical Sourcing program launched over 30 years ago and is dedicated to ensuring that facilities involved in the production of our toys, games and licensed consumer products comply with Hasbro\u2019s Global Business Ethics Principles. The program is designed to ensure fair and safe working conditions; fairness, dignity and respect for workers; and robust supplier engagement to ensure strong safety, health and environmental performance. While working on these issues with partners, suppliers, third-party factories and licensees is complex, we remain vigilant in our commitment to ensure workers in our supply chain are treated in accordance with our high ethical standards and applicable laws. Key goals and objectives in this area include: \u2022Ensure 100% third-party suppliers and major subcontractors are audited on an annual basis through unannounced audits, supplemented by spot, oversight audits.  \u2022Require 100% of third-party suppliers and major subcontractors to participate and complete the Hasbro Ethical Sourcing Academy, a 30-hour, e-learning social compliance course, which trains and reinforces Hasbro\u2019s rigorous ethical sourcing requirements. This mandatory online training is in addition to monthly, in-person vendor workshops that the Hasbro Ethical Sourcing team hosts in our sourcing office locations around the world.  \u2022Empower factory workers through our Worker Well-Being program, which provides life-enhancing skills training and knowledge on topics from nutrition and reproductive health to problem solving and financial literacy. Human Capital Management Overview Our key human capital management objectives for our direct workforce are to attract, develop and retain diverse talent. The experience, dedication and diverse backgrounds of our employees are at the heart of our success, energizing everything we do, from developing innovative products to creating immersive game, consumer products and entertainment experiences. Our teams are inspired by our Purpose of creating joy and community for all people around the world. Our inclusive culture sets us up to deliver excellence, build impactful brands and expand our leadership in play, entertainment and beyond. As our organization continues to evolve, we remain steadfast in our ambition to provide a supportive and inclusive community where everyone can show up authentically as themselves and deliver their best work. The following discusses our governance of human capital management and our key focus areas and priorities. Governance Our governance of human capital management falls within the governance structure for ESG overall. The Governance Committee of the Board oversees the company\u2019s human capital policies and practices, including the Company\u2019s approach to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. The Compensation Committee of the Board oversees our compensation programs. Our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO and is a member of our ELT, is responsible for developing and executing key aspects of our human capital strategy, including the attraction, acquisition, development and engagement of talent to deliver on the Company\u2019s strategy, the design of competitive compensation and employee benefit programs. Our Chief Purpose Officer, together with other members of our ELT, are responsible for developing and executing our global ESG strategy, including our human rights and ethical sourcing programs for the workers across our supply and value chain.  Our CEO and Chief People Officer chair our internal DE&I Steering Committee, a committee comprised of global management leaders from various parts of the business. The DE&I Steering Committee is responsible for setting  23 23 23 Table of Contents Table of Contents and reviewing the Company\u2019s DE&I strategy and performance and identifying any gaps and opportunities. Our Senior Vice President of DE&I and Multicultural Strategy is responsible for executing the strategy and presenting our DE&I progress to the Board twice yearly. Employees As of year-end 2022, we employed approximately 6,490 people worldwide, with approximately 53% of our employees in North America (45% in the United States; 8% in Canada), 22% in Europe, 18% in Asia Pacific, and 6% in Latin America (includes Mexico). As of year-end, approximately 53% of our global workforce was female, 45% of our employees in managerial roles (director level and above) were female, and racially/ethnically diverse employees represented approximately 22% of the Company's U.S. workforce, of which 15% were in managerial roles. For our U.S. workforce, we also disclose our diversity by job type (based on the EEO-1 filing), which is available in our publicly available ESG Progress Report 2021-2022. The contents of our ESG Progress Report are not incorporated herein. Approximately 11% of our employees globally are covered by unions or collective bargaining agreements. Focus Area: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion We believe that the more inclusive we are as a company, the more effective our employees will be and the stronger our business will perform. Hasbro views DE&I as a strategic ESG priority that is linked to the success of our business and the growth of our brands. We want our work to move beyond traditional gender and demographic stereotypes and to celebrate people of all backgrounds and lived experiences. We know this work begins with our people, and we work diligently to foster an inclusive culture with a diverse workforce that reflects the consumers and communities we serve globally.  Recent steps we have taken to further build a culture of DE&I within our organization and within the industries and communities in which we operate include: \u2022On track to achieve our 2025 DE&I goals for the organization, including: \u25e6Increasing female representation in leadership (Director +) roles globally to 50%  \u25e6Increasing ethnically and racially diverse employee representation in the U.S. to 25% \u2022Continued our work to foster a culture of inclusion through unconscious bias training and Employee Network events. \u2022Issued a DE&I spotlight report, as a part of our comprehensive ESG Progress Report 2021-2022, that outlines our commitments, strategies and progress in fostering DE&I. Focus Area: Employee Engagement At Hasbro, we support a number of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These groups reflect our diverse employee population and provide dynamic opportunities for employee engagement. Our ERGs give voice to member concerns, create opportunities for networking and leadership skills development, support employee recruitment and retention efforts and celebrate ethnic and cultural themes important to our global team. In addition to our ERGs, we established a Business Resource Group (BRG), which provides a channel for the employees to provide the business with input, guidance and perspective on strategic brand development and marketing initiatives early in the creation process related to race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status and ability. Focus Area: Compensation, Health, Safety & Well-being of Employees Employee attraction, development and retention has long been a key Hasbro priority. We recognize and reward our employees with a total rewards package that includes competitive base pay, equity compensation (for certain levels), annual incentives, product discounts and other comprehensive benefits, including wellness programs that help people integrate work and life commitments. Competitive compensation is the cornerstone of our total rewards program. We regularly review salary ratios for men and women in similar roles to help maintain internal equity and market competitiveness across the globe. We review both industry and local market data at least annually to identify trends and market gaps to maintain the competitiveness of our compensation and employee benefit programs.

Trademarks, Copyrights and Patents We seek to protect our products, for the most part, and in as many countries as practical, through registered trademarks, copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available, cost effective, and meaningful. The loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business. Government Regulation Our toy and game products sold in the United States are subject to the provisions of The Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, (as amended, the \u201cCPSIA\u201d), The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (the \u201cFHSA\u201d), The Flammable Fabrics Act (the \u201cFFA\u201d), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition, a few of our products, are also subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. The CPSIA empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the \u201cCPSC\u201d) to take action against hazards presented by consumer products, including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards. The CPSC has the authority to seek to declare a product \u201ca banned hazardous substance\u201d under the CPSIA and to ban it from commerce. The CPSC can file an action to seize and condemn an \u201cimminently hazardous consumer product\u201d under the CPSIA and may also order equitable remedies such as recall, replacement, repair or refund for the product. The FHSA provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned. 25 25 25 Table of Contents Table of Contents Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the United States and in many international markets including Canada, Australia and Europe. We utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the CPSIA, the FHSA, the FFA, other applicable domestic and international product standards, and our own standards. Any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, depending on the product and scope of the recall, could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well. The Children\u2019s Television Act of 1990 and the rules and regulations of the United States Federal Communications Commission, the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the laws of certain other countries, also place limitations on television commercials during children\u2019s programming and on advertising in other forms to children, and on the collection of information from children, such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act. In addition to laws restricting the collection of information from children, our business is subject to other regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, which restricts the collection, use, and retention of personal information, as well as data protection laws in the United States and other countries. Failure to comply with any of those restrictions can subject us to severe liabilities. Further, we maintain programs to comply with various United States federal, state, local and international requirements relating to the environment, health, safety and other matters.
