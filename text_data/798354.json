Servicing the Market The financial technology industry is highly dynamic, with new innovations entering the market and driving the expectations of our clients globally. The markets for our solutions have specific needs and requirements, with strong emphasis placed by clients on quality, security, service reliability, timely introduction of new capabilities and features, flexibility and value. This requires us to continue our focus on product and service delivery, integration and innovation to meet and exceed the specific needs of our clients. We believe that our financial strength and specialized market knowledge enable us to support our clients to meet their changing preferences. In addition, we believe that our focus on quality, innovation, client service and our commitment of substantial resources to training and technical support helps us to identify and fulfill the needs of our clients. Product Development To meet the changing technology needs of our clients, we continually develop, maintain and enhance our products and systems. Our development and technology operations apply the expertise of multiple teams to design, develop and maintain specialized products and processing systems. Our products and solutions are designed to meet the preferences and diverse requirements of the international, national, regional or local market-specific merchant and financial services environments of our clients. In developing our products, we use current software development principles, such as service-oriented architecture, to create efficiencies, and we stress interaction with and responsiveness to the needs of our clients. Resources Our business depends on a variety of resources to operate including products and services provided to us by third parties. For example, we rely on our human capital resources for product development (including product design and coding), sales, operations (including customer service, technology support, security and compliance) and management; access to financial and telecommunication networks; computers, servers, mainframes, microchips and other computer equipment; and Clover and other POS devices.

We believe we have access to the resources necessary for our current business needs.

We believe that we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business. Competition The market for technology products and services in the industries we serve is fragmented, highly competitive, and served by a multitude of large and small businesses. Our principal competitors include other large, integrated providers of financial services technology and payment systems, data processing affiliates of large companies, processing centers owned or operated as user cooperatives, financial institutions, merchant acquirers, ISOs, ISVs, payments companies and payment network operators. Our competitors also include global and local IT product and services companies and payment service providers and processors. We expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand or consolidate their product lines and services. Some of these competitors possess substantial financial, sales and marketing resources and can compete with us in various ways, including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing and long-standing relationships. Depending on the product or service, competitive factors may include quality, security, innovation, breadth or novelty of features and functionality, client satisfaction, market opportunity, integration, reliability, agility, global reach, multiple distribution channels, service reliability and performance standards, timely introduction of new products and features, platform scalability and flexibility, and value. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. Additional information about competition in our segments is provided below. Acceptance Our Acceptance segment competes with merchant acquirers and financial institutions that provide acquiring and processing services to businesses on their own. In many cases, our alliance and commercial partners, such as ISOs and ISVs, compete against each other. We also compete with merchant services providers and, in a number of countries outside of the U.S., our Acceptance segment competes with a growing number of local and regional providers. In addition, payment networks and large technology, media and other integrated payments software providers are increasingly offering products and services that compete with our suite of merchant acquiring solutions. Fintech Our products and services in the Fintech segment compete with large, diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products. Existing and potential financial institution clients may also develop and use their own in-house systems. In addition, we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions. Payments The businesses in our Payments segment primarily compete with businesses that offer consumer payment solutions and a number of payment and card issuer processors. In addition to traditional payments competitors, large technology, media and other emerging financial technology providers are increasingly seeking to provide alternative payment and financing solutions. Existing and potential financial institution and other corporate clients could also develop and use their own in-house systems or custom-designed solutions instead of our products and services.  Government Regulation Our operations, and the products and services that we offer, are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the U.S. We are also subject to non-government-issued rules and requirements, such as those promulgated by various payment networks. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of service and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. We may also be required, among other things, to make significant additional investments to comply with rules and regulations, to modify our products or services or the manner in which they are provided, or to limit or change the amount or types of revenue we are able to generate.  Financial Institution Regulations.

These regulations impact our card processing businesses and our clients\u2019 ability to generate revenue. Certain of our subsidiaries hold payment institution or electronic money licenses. These subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight in the jurisdictions in which they operate, and may be required to meet minimum capital maintenance requirements or other obligations. In addition, several of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. provide services such as merchant terminal leasing, debit processing, acquiring, issuing, factoring and settlement that make them subject to regulation by financial services supervisory agencies, including the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), the Federal Financial Supervision Agency in Germany, the National Bank of Poland, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Central Bank of Brazil and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

The regulations and rules are complex and evolving and can provide for significant penalties or the suspension or termination of our registrations or certifications for non-compliance. In the U.S., we are subject to various federal and state privacy and security laws. The U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) requires financial institutions to explain their information sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data.

Development and Retention  We are committed to creating a high-performance culture that consistently delivers excellence for our clients and long-term value for our shareholders while providing a workplace experience for our employees that values collaboration, innovation and diversity. Career development and internal mobility are important aspects of our value proposition for employees. We provide employees with numerous training and development opportunities, including through an e-learning platform specifically geared toward global technology associates; our Leading Women program, designed to accelerate the professional growth of female top talent across each of our global regions; our Leading Fiserv program, designed to develop critical leadership skills for frontline managers; our Vision to Results leadership program, focused on driving enterprise goals; and an online learning platform that provides global access to over 25,000 courses.

In an effort to further encourage internal mobility, we launched a global awareness campaign intended to create a sustainable internal talent pipeline while increasing associate retention, job satisfaction and personal and professional growth opportunities. We have adopted a pay-for-performance philosophy that is designed to recognize performance and reward achievement of our strategic business objectives and financial results. Total compensation consists of a competitive base pay and annual incentive opportunity delivered in a mix of cash and equity that is designed to promote retention and reward the attainment of defined performance goals. We are committed to providing fair pay to our employees regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or any other protected characteristic, and we conduct periodic pay audits to track, measure and evaluate employee compensation. In addition, throughout the year, we celebrate employee contributions and achievements through a peer-based global recognition program that enables recognition and financial rewards. Diversity and Inclusion  We are committed to cultivating a diverse, respectful and inclusive workplace by: \u2022Advancing diversity at all levels in the organization, including increasing the representation of women and minorities in leadership positions, requiring consideration of diverse candidates for our Board of Directors and senior leadership positions, dedicating talent acquisition resources focused on hiring diverse individuals, providing career opportunities to the military community, and deepening relationships with historically black colleges and universities, industry networks, and military and veterans\u2019 organizations that provide access to underrepresented populations; and \u2022Promoting employee awareness through education and participation in diversity and inclusion programs, such as our inclusive leader assessment and coaching program, to develop the competencies necessary to create an inclusive workplace; eight Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) with over 6,500 associate members who support each other and mutually elevate professional development; and a host of diversity and inclusion training courses available to all employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 41,000 employees worldwide, approximately 41% of whom were female. In the U.S., approximately 37% of our employees self-identified as racially/ethnically diverse. We continue to focus on our efforts on supporting our community with several initiatives, including: \u2022Investing in small, minority-owned businesses by providing financial support, business expertise, and leading technology solutions, as well as through strategic partnerships and community engagement; and  \u2022Strengthening partnerships with organizations focused on human rights, racial equity and social justice, including through work by our ERGs with over 100 community organizations and groups. Employee Engagement   We value employee engagement and feedback. Throughout the year, we engage with our employees through events such as lunch-and-learns, quarterly all-hands meetings, town halls, leadership meetings and other forums. We encourage managers to meet regularly with their teams and encourage skip-level discussions. 10 10 10 Table of Contents \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Table of Contents \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  To assess employee engagement, we periodically collect employee feedback through employee engagement surveys, including annual enterprise-wide surveys and issue-specific surveys. These surveys cover a variety of topics, such as engagement, well-being, client experience, communication, teamwork, manager effectiveness, trust and diversity and inclusion. In addition to assessing engagement, the survey results enable us to gain insight into employee perspectives and issues which we use to enhance processes, set priorities and respond to associate concerns.  Safety and Well-Being We are committed to the safety of our workforce and maintain a global safety program that is designed to protect the safety and well-being of our employees in the workplace, minimize injury and accident frequency and severity, minimize loss to property, equipment and operational disruption, and enable greater associate satisfaction and productivity. We are also committed to providing comprehensive and competitive benefits to our associates that are responsive to their physical, financial, social and emotional needs. Our benefit offerings include a variety of medical and dental plan choices, mental health and counseling programs, caregiver support programs, enhanced family forming and planning resources, and paid time off. Significantly, we have not increased the cost of health care benefits for our employees in the past two years despite the increased cost of such benefits to the company.
