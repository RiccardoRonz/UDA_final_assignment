{"cik": 711404, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01. Business. \u00a0 OVERVIEW   The Cooper Companies, Inc. (Cooper, we or the Company), is a global medical device company with a mission to improve lives one person at a time. We partner with health care providers worldwide to improve patient outcomes and deliver practice-building resources and training. By listening closely to the healthcare providers and patients, we fulfill the needs of today while focusing on the opportunities of tomorrow through innovation and strategic investment.   Cooper operates through two business segments, CooperVision and CooperSurgical. Our two business segments elevate standards of care with products and services in the fields of vision, fertility and women\u2019s health. For financial information relating to these business segments, refer to Note 12. Business Segment Information in Item\u00a08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. \u00a0 CooperVision is a global manufacturer providing products for contact lens wearers. CooperVision develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of single-use, two-week and monthly contact lenses, featuring advanced materials and optics. CooperVision designs its products to address vision challenges such as astigmatism, presbyopia and myopia with a broad collection of spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses. CooperVision offers contact lenses in materials like silicone hydrogel Aquaform technology. CooperVision also manufactures and markets myopia management products, including the internally developed MiSight 1 day lens, as well as other specialty eyecare products such as orthokeratology (ortho-k) and scleral lenses. In November 2019, the MiSight 1 day lens became the first and only product approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for slowing the progression of myopia in children aged 8-12 at the initiation of treatment, and in August 2021, CooperVision received Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approval for use of the MiSight 1 day lens in China. CooperVision\u2019s major manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Belgium, Costa Rica, Hungary, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and the United States, with other smaller facilities in multiple locations around the world.   CooperSurgical offers a broad array of products and services focused on fertility and women's health. We categorize CooperSurgical product sales based on the point of health care delivery, which includes: products used in medical offices, ambulatory surgical centers and hospitals primarily by Obstetricians/Gynecologists (OB/GYN); and fertility products and services used primarily in fertility clinics. Our portfolio encompasses more than 600 products and services. Our medical devices are used in gynecology and obstetrics, including but not limited to contraception and labor and delivery as well as cord blood and cord storage services. Our fertility portfolio encompasses medical devices supporting the in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, egg and sperm donation, cryopreservation, and genomic services (including genetic testing). CooperSurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies, products and services that complement its business model. CooperSurgical's major manufacturing, cryostorage and distribution facilities are located in Costa Rica, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, with other smaller facilities in multiple locations around the world.  \u00a0 SEGMENT INFORMATION   CooperVision \u00a0 CooperVision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions: the Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific. The two major product categories of contact lenses sold by CooperVision are:  \u2022Spherical lenses, including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects, myopia management lenses, which slow the progression of and correct myopia in age-appropriate children, and other specialty lenses.  \u2022Toric and multifocal lenses, including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism, myopia and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea.   In order to achieve a comfortable and healthier lens wearing experience, products are sold with recommended wearing and replacement schedules, often referred to as modalities, with the primary modalities being single-use lenses designed for one-day use and frequent replacement (FRP) lenses  designed for two-week and monthly replacement. CooperVision offers spherical, toric, multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities and in a wide range of lens parameters.     7 7 7 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  CooperVision Product Modalities  Frequent replacement lenses  Under the Biofinity brand, CooperVision markets monthly silicone hydrogel spherical (including Biofinity Energys), toric, multifocal and toric multifocal (made-to-order) lens products. Our Biofinity brand is CooperVision's highest grossing product. CooperVision also markets two-week silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses under the Avaira Vitality brand.   Single-use lenses  CooperVision markets single-use silicone hydrogel lenses under our MyDay brand and our clariti 1 day brand. The MyDay brand is our softest line of 1-day silicone hydrogel lenses and offers spherical (including MyDay Energys ), toric, and multifocal lenses. The clariti 1-day brand is our most affordable line of silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses and offers spherical, toric, and multifocal lenses. CooperVision also offers traditional single-use hydrogel lenses under our Proclear and Biomedics brands.  CooperVision focuses on supporting the growth of all customers including key accounts (which include optical chains, global retailers, certain buying groups and mass merchandisers) by investing in selling, promotional and advertising activities. Further, we are increasing investment in our distribution and packaging capabilities to support the growth of our business and to continue providing quality service with our industry leading stock keeping unit (\"SKU\") range and customized offerings.   Market for Contact Lenses The market for spherical lenses is growing with the addition of new value-added products, such as spherical lenses that may provide improved comfort for contact lens related dryness during lens wear and that add aspherical optical properties, more higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels, and myopia management contact lenses for children aged 8 to 12 years old. CooperVision believes that there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share, particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low.  We believe that myopia management opens up an attractive new market for contact lenses. With MiSight, we offer the only FDA approved1 and first Chinese NMPA approved product to slow the progression of, and correct, myopia in age-appropriate children. This is a critical differentiator as the proactive management of myopia becomes standard-of-care within the eye care community to help reduce the progression of myopia in children, along with reducing the risks of long-term eye health problems associated with myopia such as cataracts, retinal detachment, and macular degeneration. We are investing to develop this new market by educating eye care practitioners, patients and their families, which increases awareness.  CooperVision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products, and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets, both organically and through acquisitions. In fiscal 2023, CooperVision acquired a private U.S.-based company that provides a broad portfolio of technologically advanced contact lens products, including scleral and hybrid lenses. In fiscal 2022, CooperVision acquired a private Denmark-based ortho-k contact lens distributor. These acquisitions expanded CooperVision\u2019s specialty eye care portfolio and its leadership in addressing the increasing severity and prevalence of myopia.   CooperSurgical  CooperSurgical focuses on advancing fertility and women's health through a diversified portfolio including fertility products and services, medical devices, cryostorage (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage) and contraception. We offer quality products, innovative technologies and superior services to health care professionals and patients worldwide. CooperSurgical collaborates with health care professionals to identify products and new technologies to bring to market. The result is a broad portfolio of products and services that are intended to aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes for patients and are routinely used by health care professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of women's health and reproductive issues.   CooperSurgical distributes its products and services through OB/GYN and medical offices, hospital and ambulatory surgery centers and fertility clinics, as well as direct-to-consumer. A focus area for CooperSurgical is key accounts, which include large group practices, integrated delivery networks and certain buying groups within the office/surgical business and fertility clinic networks within the fertility business. We believe our portfolio of offerings and focus on service, quality and clinical education will help increase our share of business within these key account groups.  1 Indications for use of MiSight 1 day (omafilcon A) soft (hydrophilic) contact lenses for daily wear are indicated for the correction of myopic ametropia and for slowing the progression of myopia in children with non-diseased eyes, who at the initiation of treatment are 8-12 years of age and have a refraction of -0.75 to -4.00 diopters (spherical equivalent) with \u2264 0.75 diopters of astigmatism. The lens is to be discarded after each removal. 8 8 8 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   Since its inception in 1990, CooperSurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model. In fiscal 2022, CooperSurgical acquired both a private cryopreservation services company and Generate Life Sciences (Generate), a private leading provider of donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments, fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage (cord blood and cord tissue). We expect to continue investing in CooperSurgical's business, including through strategic transactions, with the goal of expanding our integrated solutions model within the areas of fertility and women's health.  CooperSurgical Product Categories  Office/Surgical   CooperSurgical sells a wide variety of innovative medical devices and services used in gynecology and obstetrics, including in labor and delivery, as well as to screen, diagnose and treat women's health and reproductive issues.   CooperSurgical offers the cryostorage of newborn cord blood and cord tissue, which are potent sources of stem cells that have the potential for treatment and healing. Our newborn stem cell storage services are available in the United States, Canada and Australia.  PARAGARD is a hormone-free intrauterine device (IUD) offered by CooperSurgical that prevents pregnancy for up to ten years using copper as the only active ingredient. It is the only FDA approved non-hormonal IUD contraceptive option and is exclusively sold in the United States.   Fertility   CooperSurgical has broad product offerings for fertility evaluations and IVF procedures by OB/GYN professionals, reproductive endocrinologists and embryologists. In fertility clinics, our products include media, micro-tools and lab equipment. Additionally, CooperSurgical offers services to clinics and families undergoing assisted reproductive technologies including donor gametes, cryostorage, and genomic services. Market for Fertility and Women's Health Care  CooperSurgical participates in the market for women's and family health care with its diversified product lines at various points of health care delivery: OB/GYN medical offices, hospitals and surgical centers, and fertility clinics. In recent years, including with the acquisition of Generate in fiscal 2022, CooperSurgical\u2019s business increasingly includes marketing and selling to end consumers through our cryostorage (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage) and reproductive planning products and services.  CooperSurigcal expects that OB/GYN medical offices and fertility clinics will continue to move away from private practice ownership and toward group practices and networks.  As the consolidation trend continues it will have increased influence over supply chain control, group purchases, value analysis committees, product evaluation and procurement.  We believe CooperSurgical's broad product portfolio can benefit in this changing environment as customers look to standardize and consolidate vendors.  Trends specific in the OB/GYN market include:   \u2022The increase in office-based and outpatient procedures, given high patient satisfaction, reduction of healthcare costs and comparative clinical outcomes.  \u2022A focus on reducing pregnancy and childbirth complications.  \u2022The obstetrician being a key contributor to stem cell storage, facilitating the collection of cord blood and cord tissue following delivery in most markets.   \u2022Initial evaluation and treatments for infertility, such as uterine assessment, ovulatory medications and intrauterine insemination (IUI), beginning with the OB/GYN and then transitioning to fertility clinics.   Trends specific in the fertility market include:   \u2022Infertility rates are increasing globally, and there is a significant unmet need for fertility products and services.  \u2022The maternal age is increasing.  \u2022Patient awareness of, and access to, services is increasing. 9 9 9 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   \u2022The number of fertility clinics is rising worldwide.  \u2022Single parents by choice and LGBTQIA+ individuals are starting families.  \u2022Improved product offerings such as donor activity and cryopreservation services are becoming available.  \u2022Technology improvements are being developed for both male and female infertility challenges.  \u2022Worldwide disposable income is increasing.  COMPETITION  The markets in which we participate are highly competitive and involve the continual search for technological and scientific innovations. Competitive factors in these markets include technological and scientific advances, product quality and availability, price, customer service including response time and effective communication of product information to clinicians and consumers, and manufacturing processes. Competitors may have greater financial resources, larger research and development budgets, larger sales forces, greater market penetration and/or larger manufacturing capacity. Both CooperVision and CooperSurgical compete predominantly on the basis of product quality and differentiation, technological benefits, price, service levels and reliability.  CooperVision Competition   CooperVision's largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical, toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc., Alcon Inc. and Bausch + Lomb. To a lesser extent, CooperVision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery. We believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous categories of the contact lens market, companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently. CooperVision competes in its markets by producing high, medium and low-volume lenses made with a variety of materials for a broader range of market niches, as well as offering a wide range of lens parameters, leading to a higher rate of successful fitting for practitioners and better visual acuity for patients. Our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving success in our business. We also compete based on our customer and professional services.   CooperSurgical Competition   CooperSurgical focuses on selected segments of the fertility and women's health care market with a diversified portfolio  including fertility products and services, medical devices, cryostorage (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage) and contraception. CooperSurgical's strategy includes developing and acquiring new solutions to complement our current offerings. In the fertility market, CooperSurgical competes against Vitrolife Group, FujiFilm-Irvine Scientific, Cook Medical, Hamilton Thorne, and Fairfax Cryobank and Fairfax EggBank. We also compete with fertility clinics offering their own services. Larger companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and Hologic have offerings that compete with our medical device products. In the stem cell storage field, we compete primarily with ViaCord, a division of Revvity, in the United States, as well as other smaller companies globally. With PARAGARD, we compete with manufacturers of hormonal IUDs including Bayer and AbbVie, Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs) including Organon, and other forms of birth control. We are aware of a non-hormonal IUD under development, which may compete with PARAGARD in the future.   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  The Company employs approximately 400 people in research and development. CooperVision's product development and clinical research is supported by internal and external specialists in lens design, formulation science, polymer chemistry, engineering, clinical trials, microbiology and biochemistry. CooperVision's research and development activities primarily include programs to develop new contact lens designs, myopia management, and manufacturing technologies, along with improving formulations and existing products.  CooperSurgical conducts research and development in-house, and works with external specialists when necessary, in mechanical, electrical, biomedical and software engineering, as well as life sciences. CooperSurgical research and development activities are focused on innovating, improving, and advancing our products and services including, instruments, devices, consumables, digital services, and manufacturing technologies.    10 10 10 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  GOVERNMENT REGULATION  Our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and a variety of regulatory agencies in other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. These regulations govern, among other things, the design and development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, premarket clearance, approval or certification, post-market vigilance reporting, advertising and promotion, and sales and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with the applicable regulations, which are subject to established and new legislation and change, could result in enforcement action by the FDA, or other U.S. or foreign government agencies which may include, among other things, any of the following consequences: warning letters, civil penalties, refusal or withdrawal of approvals or certifications, license suspension or revocation, product recalls, operating restrictions, suspension or shutdown of production, and criminal prosecution.   Regulation in the United States  Medical Devices   Most of our products are medical devices, which must comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated by the FDA thereunder. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes\u2014Class I, II or III\u2014depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure the medical device's safety and effectiveness. Both CooperVision and CooperSurgical develop and market medical devices subject to different levels of FDA regulation depending on the classification and risk profile of the device. Class III devices, such as extended wear contact lenses, require extensive premarket testing and approval, while Class I and II devices require lower levels of regulation. The majority of CooperSurgical's products are Class II devices. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the United States will require either premarket notification to the FDA requesting clearance for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, a premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA, or a de novo classification and request for marketing authorization submitted to and granted by the FDA.  If we are required to obtain a 510(k) clearance for a device that we wish to market, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device commercially distributed in the United States before May 28, 1976 (a pre-amendments device), or to a device that was found to be substantially equivalent to a pre-amendments device. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA automatically designates the device as a Class III device. The sponsor of a device automatically designated as Class III must either fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements or request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process. The de novo process is a pathway to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.  A PMA application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification procedures, or if the device has been previously classified as Class III. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Prior to commencing human clinical trials, submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) and receipt of IDE approval from the FDA is required if the device under evaluation presents a significant risk to human health. The process of gathering supporting information leading up to PMA application, and the subsequent FDA review, can take several years.  A majority of the medical devices we currently market have received FDA clearance through the 510(k) process or approval through the PMA process. Because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop, or any product enhancements, will be exempt from the premarket clearance or approval requirements, or will be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process rather than the PMA process, significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur.   After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; the FDA's Quality System Regulation (QSR), which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, production, control, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion; FDA unique device identifier regulations, which require changes to labeling and packaging; and medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. The FDA has  11 11 11 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections for cause by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations.  In the United States, under the FDCA and the FDA\u2019s regulatory framework, in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) are a type of medical device that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases, such as cancer, or other conditions. The FDA considers Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) to be a subset of IVDs that are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. Furthermore, in October 2023, the FDA published a proposed rule to amend its regulations to make explicit that LDTs are devices under the FDCA. As we operate a genetic testing laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulations, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory tests we perform and to comply with standards applicable to our operations, including test processes, personnel, facilities administration, equipment maintenance, recordkeeping, quality systems and proficiency testing. We have current certification under CLIA to perform testing at our New Jersey facility. In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under CLIA, licensure is required and maintained for our laboratory under state law.  Human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products  We currently operate a provider of donated reproductive tissue (eggs and sperm) for fertility treatments, fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage. Eggs and sperm are regulated by the FDA as human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps). In addition, Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) authorizes the FDA to issue regulations with respect to HCT/Ps. To be regulated as a \"361 HCT/P\", the product must, among other things, be minimally manipulated and intended only for homologous uses. HCT/Ps regulated as 361 HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, and stringent requirements for processing, storing, labeling and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, record keeping and adverse event reporting, among other applicable requirements and laws. 361 HCT/Ps do not require 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, submission of a Biologics License Application, or other premarket authorization from the FDA before marketing. We believe our HCT/Ps are regulated as 361 HCT/Ps.   Pharmaceutical Products  In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the FDCA and its implementing drug regulations. The FDA has determined that the primary mode of action for PARAGARD is the drug component and is therefore regulated by the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research as a drug product. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves numerous and time-consuming steps, including preclinical laboratory tests, human clinical trials, FDA reviews, inspections and audits and compliance with post-approval requirements.   Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA as the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to be in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and other requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, promotion and distribution of pharmaceutical products.   Foreign Regulation  Health authorities in foreign countries regulate Cooper's clinical studies and medical device sales. Even if the FDA has cleared or approved a product in the United States, the regulatory agencies or notified bodies in other countries must approve or certify new products and product modifications before they may be marketed in those countries. The regulations vary widely from country to country, although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union (EU), United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries. Medical devices marketed or sold in the EU must meet the CE mark requirements and maintain certain certifications. CooperVision maintains ISO 13485 certification and CE marks for its products and CooperSurgical maintains ISO 13485 certification and CE marks for medical devices and ISO 15189 certification for the genomics laboratories. The ISO 13485 Quality Management System certification is now also required for registration of products in Asia Pacific and Latin American countries, among many other requirements for registration in these countries. In order to maintain these quality benchmarks, the Company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures.   The EU rules below are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, while the majority of the United Kingdom now operates under a separate regulatory regime following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020.    12 12 12 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  Medical Device and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation in the EU  Until May 25, 2021, medical devices sold in the EU were regulated by the Medical Device Directive (the EU MDD), which has been repealed and replaced by the Medical Device Regulation (the EU MDR). Similarly, the EU has adopted the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (the EU IVDR), which repealed and replaced the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (the EU IVDD) and became applicable on May 26, 2022. The majority of our current certificates have been granted under the EU MDD and the EU IVDD. Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU MDD and EU IVDD may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service provided that the requirements of transitional provisions are fulfilled. Pursuing marketing of medical devices (including IVDs) in the EU will require that our devices be certified under the new regimes set forth in the EU MDR and the EU IVDR.   In the EU, the safety and performance of medical devices (including IVDs) are evaluated by the designated Notified Bodies via the submission of Technical Dossiers, depending on the product classifications. A Declaration of Conformity to the Medical Device Directive (MDD) or Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is drawn out as a basis for European conformity marking (CE Mark). All medical devices placed on the EU market must meet general safety and performance requirements, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art.   Compliance with the general safety and performance requirements is also a prerequisite for CE mark, without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification. With certain exceptions, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of notified bodies, which are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. Typically, satisfactory completion of an audit and examinations of a product\u2019s technical dossiers and the manufacturer\u2019s quality system is required before the issuance of a certificate by the notified body. This certificate, along with the Declaration of Conformity, are then used by the manufacturer as basis for CE mark.   Throughout the term of the certificate, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements.   In addition, all manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU are subject to various other regulations, including compliance with the EU medical device vigilance system, directives and requirements regarding the advertisement and promotion of medical devices and inspections rights of regulatory authorities.   Laboratory Developed Test Regulation in the EU  In the EU, laboratory developed tests (LDTs) are exempt from the regulations that govern medical devices and IVDs under certain conditions. In order to fall within this exemption under the EU IVDD, medical devices, including LDTs, had to be designed and used within such health institutions (which may include hospitals, laboratories and public health institutions that support the healthcare system and/or address patient needs but do not treat or care for patients directly) on a non-industrial scale, without being released into the market. While the legal framework for applying the exemption under the EU IVDD to LDTs was not entirely clear, the EU IVDR may provide greater clarity on the regulation of LDTs.  Our current and future tests will need to be analyzed as to whether any or all of them would qualify for an exemption under EU IVDR; otherwise, we will be required to comply with various certification and documentation criteria, and we may be subject to conformity assessments and inspections.   Medical Devices and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulations in the United Kingdom  Following the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, EU laws no longer apply directly in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). Under the terms of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol agreed between the EU and United Kingdom, many EU laws, including those relating to medical devices and IVDs do still apply in Northern Ireland.  In Great Britain, the legislative regime currently continues to be based on the requirements set out in the EU MDD, the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (EU AIMDD), and the EU IVDD. However, the Government is currently developing substantial reforms to the Great Britain regulatory regime for medical devices and IVDs.    13 13 13 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  Medical Device and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation in Asia Pacific  As in other regions, securing regulatory approvals in Asia Pacific is a critical aspect of commercializing our products. While medical device regulations in the Asia Pacific are based on similar regulatory fundamentals (such as risk-based classification of devices) as other regions, navigating the regulatory landscape in Asia Pacific is extremely complex. Medical device regulation in Asia Pacific differs significantly country by country, requiring specific regulatory affairs expertise in each country, as well as country-based regulatory strategies. The regulatory framework maturity in Asia Pacific is widely varied ranging from well-established to emerging, approval timelines can be lengthy and unpredictable and there is less access to and engagement with regulators compared to other markets. Several key Asia Pacific markets require regulatory approval in other countries prior to registration, increasing the time from completion of product development to product launch. For example, in China, manufacturers must provide proof of home country approval (such as the United States or EU) as part of the regulatory registration/approval process.   The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) regulates medical devices in China. Medical devices in China are classified by risk into Class I (lowest risk), Class II or Class III (highest risk). China requires physical testing (known as \u2018type testing\u2019) of medical device samples by in-country testing centers to confirm compliance with specifications and standards, both pre- and post-market. Additionally, NMPA generally requires in-country clinical trials to support new product registrations, rather than relying on foreign clinical data.  In Japan, the primary regulation governing medical devices is the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act (PMD Act). The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (PMDA) regulate medical devices. The PMDA evaluates the safety and effectiveness of medical devices prior to granting marketing authorization or approval, and monitors post-market safety of approved devices. The PMDA is also the Quality Management System (QMS) Inspection Authority. Medical devices are placed into one of four risk classes based on potential risk, with Class I being the lowest potential risk and Class IV being the highest. Contact lenses, for example, are regulated as Class III devices and require premarket approval (registration), an expensive and lengthy process depending on the application category. A novel or new medical device application will generally require local clinical trial data, extending the time to approval. The registration process in Japan requires a QMS application and inspection. Additionally, separate from the registration process, a Foreign Manufacturer Registration is required before a company can import medical devices manufactured outside Japan.  Japan and Australia participate in the Medical Device Single Audit Program, which allows for the acceptance of QMS audit reports from other participating Regulatory Authorities, including the FDA.  Other Health Care Regulation  We are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect personal health-related information, including the following:  \u2022state, federal and similar foreign anti-kickback laws, which generally prohibit payments and other forms of remuneration to induce or in return for the purchase, lease, order or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of a product or service;  \u2022the federal physician self-referral law, known as the Stark Law, which generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to receive designated health services from an entity which the physician, or a member of the physician's immediate family, has a financial interest in;  \u2022the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits any individual or entity from presenting or causing to be presented false claims for payment to the federal government;  \u2022federal and state laws that prohibit executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to obtain money from any healthcare benefit program under false pretenses;  \u2022the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state and foreign laws that require medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose financial relationships with health care professionals and teaching hospitals; and  \u2022data privacy and security laws and regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which are intended to protect the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information.  Coverage and Reimbursement  Market acceptance and sales of our CooperSurgical products to our customers, who primarily consist of hospitals and surgical centers, OB/GYN medical offices and fertility clinics, will depend on the availability of payor coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement, for the procedures using our products, by government insurance programs and other third- 14 14 14 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  party payors. Payor coverage and reimbursement for procedures using medical devices in the United States and international markets vary significantly by country. With respect to drug coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of drugs, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We believe the overall escalating cost of medical products and services being paid for by the government and private health insurance has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare and medical device industry to reduce the costs of products and services.  Healthcare Reform  In the United States and foreign countries, there has been, and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates. We expect that additional state, federal and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that state, federal and foreign governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures.  Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. Passed in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical, medical device and clinical laboratory industries. Additionally, there has recently been heightened scrutiny by governmental authorities, individual hospitals, and third-party payors over product prices, which has resulted in proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025).   In the EU, regulations have been adopted which are intended to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including certain high-risk medical devices, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas.   Other Laws and Regulations  We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws, including provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, laws applicable to our facilities, products or manufacturing processes, including evolving regulations regarding the use of hazardous substances or chemicals in our products, and laws related to the protection of the environment, environmental health and safety regulations, Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) in electrical and electronic equipment in the EU, and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances (REACH).  We are subject to various other federal, state and foreign laws related to the manufacturing and distribution of our products and to our international operations, including export control and trade compliance laws.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  program also includes a suite of security technologies and tools to implement and automate security protections for our networks, employees, and customers. Our cybersecurity team reports to the Audit Committee quarterly on information security and cybersecurity matters, or as needed.

RAW MATERIALS  Our businesses utilize various chemicals, packaging materials, components, parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source. However, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens, certain medical devices and IVF products. Supply of these materials is protected by contractual agreements and safety stocks. However, if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis, or at all for any reason, we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in the supply of products if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice.\u00a0  MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION  CooperVision markets our products through our own field sales representatives, distributors and eye care practitioners, including optometrists, ophthalmologists, opticians and optical chains.

SEASONALITY  CooperVision and CooperSurgical net sales in the fiscal first quarter, which runs from November 1 through January\u00a031, are typically lower than subsequent quarters, as patient traffic to practitioners' offices, fertility clinics, and hospitals/surgical centers for surgical procedures is less during the holiday season.  16 16 16 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC.
