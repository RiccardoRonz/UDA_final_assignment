Our Market Opportunity   We compete in a market of greater than $300 billion consisting of outsourced research and development, real-world evidence and connected health and technology enabled clinical and commercial operations markets for life sciences companies and the broader healthcare industry. The following sets forth our estimates for the size of our principal markets:  \u2022Outsourced research and development: Biopharmaceutical spending on drug development totaled approximately $160 billion in 2022. Of that amount, we estimate that our addressable opportunity (clinical development spending excluding preclinical spending) was approximately $84 billion. The portion of this addressable opportunity that was outsourced in 2022, based on our estimates, was approximately $43 billion.  \u2022Real-World Evidence and connected health: Total addressable market of approximately $62 billion based on 2022 sales that consists of tightly coupled life sciences and healthcare markets. First, the life sciences market for Real-World Evidence of approximately $22 billion includes post-launch evidence generation, market access, and patient engagement services. Second, the market for connected healthcare of approximately $40 billion includes areas such as revenue cycle management, payer analytics and clinical decision support services.  \u2022Technology enabled commercial operations: Total addressable market of approximately $78 billion based on 2022 sales that includes information, data warehousing, IT outsourcing, software applications and other services in the broader market for IT services. This addressable market also includes commercial services such as recruiting, training, deploying and managing global sales forces, channel management, patient engagement services, market access consulting, brand communication, advisory services, and health information analytics and technology consulting.  In deriving estimates of the size of the various markets described above, we review third-party sources, which include estimates and forecasts of spending in various segments, in combination with internal IQVIA research and analysis informed by our experience serving these segments, as well as projected growth rates for each of these segments. See \u201cIndustry and Market Data\u201d above.  We believe there are six key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for research and development services, technology & analytics solutions and contract sales and medical solutions:  Growth and innovation in the life sciences industry. The life sciences industry is a large and critical part of the global healthcare system and, according to the latest information available from the IQVIA Market Prognosis service, is estimated to have generated approximately $1.48 trillion in revenues in 2022. According to our research, revenue growth in the life sciences industry globally is expected to range from 3% to 6% between 2023 and 2027. According to the IQVIA Institute, it is estimated that spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets will expand at a 5% to 8% compound annual growth rate (\u201cCAGR\u201d) through 2027. The growth of emerging markets demonstrates their strategic importance to global life sciences organizations along with the emergence of local and regional companies with similar operational and informational needs. We expect all of these organizations to apply a high degree of sophistication to their commercial operations in these countries, especially as some begin to emerge as sources of original innovative products. For global companies, this requires highly localized knowledge and information assets, the development of market access strategies and performance benchmarking. In addition, local players are learning that they need to compete on the basis of improved information and analytics.  6 6 6   Growth in Research and Development. Spending trends in research and development are impacted as a result of several factors, including major biopharmaceutical companies\u2019 efforts to replenish revenues lost from the so-called \u201cpatent cliff,\u201d increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry, and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities. The IQVIA Institute also estimates that approximately 300 new molecular entities (\u201cNMEs\u201d) are expected to be approved between 2023 and 2027, or 60 per year compared to 58 per year on average during the past decade. We believe that further research and development spending, combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape, will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies, particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings, to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre- and post-launch solutions development and commercialization needs. The impact of recent legislative changes on product launch and industry innovation continues to be evaluated. IQVIA is involved with many stakeholders throughout the industry as we help navigate changes over the coming decade.  Increased Complexity in Research and Development. Biopharmaceutical companies face environments in which it has become increasingly difficult to operate. Improved standards of care in many therapeutic areas and the emergence of new types of therapies, such as biologics, genetically targeted therapies, gene and stem cell therapies, and other treatment modalities have led to more complex development and regulatory pathways. We believe that our global clinical development capabilities, including our expertise in biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network, position us well to help biopharmaceutical companies manage the complexities inherent in an environment where this type of expertise is important. For example, Connected Intelligence helps us validate protocols to ensure studies in new disease areas have greater accuracy and also enables us, through innovations such as predictive analytics, to find patients who may not have been diagnosed.  Regulators require clinical trials to involve local populations as part of the process for approving new pharmaceutical products, especially in certain Asian and emerging markets. Understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences in different ethnic populations and being able to conduct clinical trials locally in certain geographies will be important to pharmaceutical product growth strategies, both for multinational and local/regional biopharmaceutical companies. We believe that our global clinical development capabilities and unmatched presence in Asia and other emerging markets make us a strong partner for biopharmaceutical companies managing the complexities of international drug development.  Financial pressures driving the need for increased efficiency. Despite expected accelerating growth in the global life sciences market, we believe our clients will face increased operating margin pressure due to their changing product mix, pricing and reimbursement challenges, and rising costs of compliance. Product portfolios for life sciences companies have shifted toward specialty products with lower peak market sales potential than traditional primary care medicines. We believe that the need for biopharmaceutical companies to maximize productivity and lower costs across their processes from research and development through commercial operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency. Further, our clients are looking for new ways to simplify processes and drive operational efficiencies by using automation, consolidating vendors and adopting new technology options such as hosted and cloud-based applications. This provides opportunities for technology services vendors to capture and consolidate the internal spending of life sciences companies by providing lower-cost and variable-cost options that lower clients\u2019 research and development, selling, marketing and administrative costs.  Evolving need to integrate and structure expanding sources of data. Over the past decade, many health systems around the world have focused on digitizing medical records. While such records theoretically enhance access to data, relevant information is often unintegrated, unstructured, siloed in disparate software systems, or entered inconsistently. In addition, new sources of data from the internet, such as social media and information on limited patient pools, and information resulting from enhanced diagnostic technologies are creating new sources of healthcare data.  In order to derive valuable insights from existing and expanding sources of information, clients need access to statistically significant data sets organized into databases that can be queried and analyzed. For example, real-world evidence studies demonstrate practical and clinical efficacies, which we believe require the aggregation and integration of large clinical data sets across all care settings, types of therapies and patient cohorts. Longitudinal studies require analysis of non-identified patient diagnoses, treatments, procedures and laboratory test results to identify types of patients that will likely best respond to particular therapies. Finally, manufacturers also require the ability to analyze social media activity to identify unmet patient needs and support for new orphan drugs. This information is highly relevant to all healthcare stakeholders and we believe the opportunity to more broadly apply healthcare data can only be realized through structuring, organizing and integrating new and existing forms of data in conjunction with sophisticated analytics.  7 7 7   Need for demonstrated value in healthcare. Participants in the healthcare industry are focused on improving quality and reducing costs, both of which require assessment of quality and value of therapies and providers. As a result, physicians no longer make prescribing decisions in isolation, but rather in the context of guidance and rules from payers, integrated delivery networks and governments. We believe life sciences companies are working to bring alignment across constituents on the value of their treatments in order to successfully develop and commercialize new therapies.  There is increasing pressure on life sciences companies to support and justify the value of their therapies. Many new drugs that are being approved are more expensive than existing therapies and will likely receive heightened scrutiny by regulators and payers to determine whether the existing treatment options would be sufficient. Additionally, many new specialty drugs are molecular-based therapies and require a more detailed understanding of clinical factors and influencers that demonstrate therapeutic value. As a result, leading life sciences companies are utilizing more sophisticated outcome research and data analytics services.  We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these global trends in healthcare. Beyond our proprietary information assets, we have developed key capabilities to assess opportunities to develop and commercialize therapies, support and defend the value of medicines and help our clients operate more efficiently through the application of insight-driven decision-making and cost-efficient technology solutions.  Our Growth Strategy  We believe we are well positioned for continued growth across the markets we serve. Our strategy for achieving growth includes:  Continue to innovate through our Connected Intelligence by leveraging our information, advanced analytics, transformative technology and significant domain expertise.

To facilitate the disclosure of comparable, consistent, and reliable ESG information, the 2022 ESG Report will be aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\"SASB\") and the Global Reporting Initiative (\"GRI\") reporting frameworks by including therein and reporting against their respective reporting standards indexes. The 2022 ESG Report also discusses our climate-related risks and opportunities in accordance with the recommended disclosures of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\").   Government Regulation  Many aspects of our businesses are regulated by federal and state laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, we maintain a robust compliance program aimed at ensuring we operate our business in compliance with all existing legal requirements material to the operation of our businesses. There are, however, occasionally uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, fines or other sanctions. See Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\u201d for additional detail.  Good Clinical Practice  Good Clinical Practice (\u201cGCP\u201d) regulations and guidelines are the industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to maintaining the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects. The United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d), Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and most other global regulatory authorities expect that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on clinical trials conducted in accordance with GCP provisions. Records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the FDA and other regulators.  Regulation of Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices  In the United States, pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDC Act\u201d), the Public Health Service Act (\u201cPHS Act\u201d), and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products. Failure to comply with applicable United States requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) for a new drug, a biologics license application (\u201cBLA\u201d) for a new biological product, pre-market approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) or clearance for a new medical device, warning or untitled letters, clinical holds, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.  11 11 11   Regulation of Patient Information  Our information management services relate to the processing of information regarding patient diagnosis and treatment of disease and are, therefore, subject to substantial governmental regulation. In addition, the confidentiality of patient-specific information and the circumstances under which such patient-specific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated. Federal, state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession, use and dissemination of personal data, such as personal health information and personal financial data, as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data. Additional legislation or regulation of this type might, among other things, require us to implement additional security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation de-identified health or other data, each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services.  In particular, personal health information is recognized in many countries such as the United States, the European Union, or EU, and several countries in Asia, as a special, sensitive category of personal information, subject to additional mandatory protections. Violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties, civil money penalties and criminal prosecution, including corporate fines and personal liability.  Regulation of Promotion, Marketing and Distribution of Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices  Certain of our services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate. Such regulation relates, among other things, to the distribution of drug samples, the marketing and promotion of approved products, the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions.  In the United States, certain of our services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices. Certain of our services are subject to the FDA\u2019s regulations against \u201coff-label promotion,\u201d which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act imposes licensing, personnel record keeping, packaging, labeling, product handling and facility storage and security requirements. Other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers, suppliers and providers from offering, giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services. The sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the United States Federal Trade Commission Act and state consumer protection laws. We are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer Contract Sales & Medical Solutions.  We are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices, including, among others, various aspects of Medicare and federal healthcare programs. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal and/or civil penalties, including possibly as an \u201caider and abettor.\u201d  Regulation of Laboratories  Our United States laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, and the safety and health of laboratory employees. Additionally, our United States laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste, radioactive materials and laboratory specimens, including the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Transportation, the National Fire Protection Agency and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d). The use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the United States by the DEA and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world. Our United States laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the DEA. The regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Public Health Service and Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens. Our laboratories also are subject to International Air Transport Association regulations, which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens. Furthermore, when the materials are sent to a foreign country, the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws, rules and regulations of such foreign country. Our laboratories outside the United States are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing, the handling and disposal of medical specimens, genetic material, hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees.  12 12 12   In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. Although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.  Further, laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (\u201cCLIA\u201d), as well as requirements established by various states. The failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the CLIA certification.  Data Privacy  Patient health information is among the most sensitive of personal information, and it is critically important that information about an individual\u2019s healthcare is properly protected from inappropriate access, use and disclosure. Real world evidence -- information that allows us to examine actual practices and outcomes -- is essential to increase access to care, improve outcomes, and lower costs. IQVIA uses a wide variety of privacy-enhancing technologies and safeguards to protect individual privacy while generating and analyzing information on a scale that helps healthcare stakeholders identify disease patterns and correlate with the precise treatment path and therapy needed for better outcomes. We employ a wide variety of methods to manage privacy requirements, including:  \u2022governance, frameworks, models and training to promote good decision making and accountability; \u2022a layered approach to privacy and security management to avoid a single point of failure; \u2022ongoing evaluation of privacy and security practices to promote continuous improvement; \u2022use of technical, administrative, physical and organizational safeguards and controls; \u2022collaboration with data suppliers and trusted third parties for our syndicated market research and analytics offerings to remove identifiable information or employ effective encryption or other techniques to render information non-identified before data is delivered to us; and \u2022work with leading researchers, policy makers, thought leaders and others in a variety of fields relevant to the application of effective privacy and security practices, including statistical, epidemiological and cryptographic sciences, legal, information security and compliance, and privacy.  We are an industry leader in de-identifying data. Our capabilities allow us to render data non-identified while still maintaining data utility, thus protecting privacy while still advancing innovation. Not only do we make use of de-identification techniques with respect to the data we hold, but we also share our expertise in this area with policymakers, regulators and others to help them understand de-identification methodologies and practical considerations to avoid re-identification risk.  We operate in more than 100 countries around the world, many of which have data protection and privacy laws and regulations based on similar core principles (e.g., openness, accountability, security safeguards, etc.). We apply those principles globally and augment our practices to address local laws, contractual obligations and other data privacy requirements.  Our Global Privacy team, led by our Global Chief Privacy Officer, is comprised of privacy professionals and privacy law experts who drive our strategy and develop and manage our policies and standards. The Global Privacy team provides subject matter expertise related to the proper management of all data types. In addition, our Global Privacy team liaises with our Legal, IT, Information Security and other teams so that privacy requirements are addressed in technology, contracting, offerings and other business activities.  The IQVIA Privacy Policy (the \"Privacy Policy\") is our foundational privacy policy. It explains how, when applicable, we collect, hold, use and disclose personal information, including that of our personnel, consumers, healthcare professionals, patients, medical research subjects, clinical investigators, customers, suppliers, vendors, business partners and investors. You can find the Privacy Policy on our website at https://www.iqvia.com/about-us/privacy/privacy-policy. Information in the Privacy Policy is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  13 13 13   Cybersecurity  We employ an array of data security technologies, processes and methods across our infrastructure to protect systems and sensitive information from unauthorized access. IQVIA maintains comprehensive identity and access management practices (e.g., roles and access privileges for each user; multi-factor authentication, privileged user accounts, single sign-on, user lifecycle management) and employs a variety of security information and event management tools.  We developed, maintain and utilize a global integrated information security framework to guide our practices, based on relevant industry frameworks and laws, including, but not limited to NIST, GxP, HITRUST, the ISO 27000 family, COBIT, GDPR, and HIPAA. The framework consists of policies, standards, procedures, work instructions and documentation. Information is classified into four categories to help individuals apply the right level of controls and safeguards to information, applications and systems.  Our cybersecurity program focuses on all areas of our business, including cloud-based environments, data centers, devices used by employees and contractors, facilities, networks, applications, vendors, disaster recovery / business continuity and controls and safeguards enabled through business processes and tools. We continuously monitor for threats and unauthorized access. We draw on the knowledge and insight of external cybersecurity experts and vendors, and employ an array of third party tools to secure IQVIA information infrastructure and protect systems and information from unauthorized access.  Non-technical safeguards also play an important role in our cybersecurity program. We provide various training programs and tools to employees so they can avoid risky practices and help us promptly identify potential or actual issues. We also have global incident response procedures, global service tools to log incidents and issues for investigation, and an ethics line to report concerns and follow-up on matters already reported.  The Global Information Security team, led by our Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\"), develops and implements our strategy, as well as monitors systems and devices for risks and threats. Our global data centers and IT controls are included in an annual SOC2 Type II attestation program carried out by an independent audit firm who performs control testing and issue reports. Our set of SOC2 controls is aligned with ISO27001 specification and therefore provide equivalent level of assurance on a global level.  The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Director's (the \"Board\") has full oversight of any cybersecurity risks and threats to our business. The Audit Committee receives regular updates on any developments from our CISO, including quarterly reports of plans and actions. In 2022, we established a Business Information Security Office to help facilitate communications and the exchange of information between our IT function and various business units. This restructuring has increased our effectiveness by strengthening links between security functions and business units, in addition to clarifying role scopes.  Our Intellectual Property  In addition to our proprietary data sets described above, we develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of legal, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We consider our trademark and related names, marks and logos to be of material importance to our business, and we have registered or applied for registration for certain of these trademarks, including IQVIA, in the United States and other jurisdictions and aggressively seek to protect them. Trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. The technology and other intellectual property rights owned and licensed by us are of importance to our business, although our management believes that our business, as a whole, is not dependent upon any one intellectual property or group of such properties.  Human Capital   Overview. Our approximately 86,000 employees help us drive our business success and achieve our ambition to advance human health. We are a diverse global team that shares a passion for collaboration and solving complex problems. Our workforce is comprised of a wide variety of professionals, including clinicians, data scientists, epidemiologists and more.  Our culture is one in which employees are encouraged to apply their insight, curiosity, and intellectual courage across everything they do. The way we manage our people and the programs we offer our employees reflect our commitment to fostering this culture of empowerment and engagement.  14 14 14    Each one of our employees provides value, no matter where they sit within the organization. We are committed to creating an environment where all employees are respected and heard, where people from all backgrounds can contribute to and share in our growth, and where opportunity and advancement is available to everyone.   Attracting, developing, and retaining a talented workforce is essential to the success of our business and the realization of our purpose. Investments in our people are motivated by our desire to have an engaged and connected workforce. This results in high productivity and better results for IQVIA. In an industry as competitive as ours, we also recognize that employees who feel supported contribute to higher retention and recruitment rates.  Board Oversight of Human Capital Management. Our Board receives periodic updates on key human capital metrics, including recruitment and attrition rates, talent development data, and diversity statistics related to hiring, promotion and our overall workforce.  The Board also devotes significant time to leadership development and succession planning at the executive level and provides guidance on important decisions in each of these areas. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board has primary responsibility for succession planning for the chief executive officer and oversight of succession planning for senior leadership.  Human Capital Management Strategy. Our employees are critical to our continued success and are a core element of our long-term strategy. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that our initiatives, policies, and processes reflect and reinforce our desired corporate culture, which we believe supports successful human capital management. Our human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:  \u2022Recruitment. We consider a range of qualified candidates for all positions. We hire qualified individuals with a variety of backgrounds and experiences from both within and outside the organization for positions at all levels.  \u2022Development & Progression. We are committed to having a diverse pipeline of talent moving up in our organization and providing opportunities for all employees to develop within their current role as well as towards their next role. We do this by encouraging mentoring and establishing support networks as well as by providing tools to help employees map out and achieve their career goals.  \u2022Retention. We seek to develop a working environment where employees feel supported and want to stay. To increase employee engagement and retention, we consistently seek feedback from employees through surveys and focus groups and develop meaningful initiatives and programs to respond to their needs.  Employee Engagement. In 2022, we completed two Company-wide employee surveys. The surveys provided a valuable opportunity to hear the perspectives of our workforce around the world, and were especially important during the largely remote working environment caused by the continuing pandemic. Maintaining regular and open channels of dialogue with employees and receiving and responding to their feedback with actionable and meaningful initiatives is critical to our human capital management strategy.  We received an average of 63,000 responses across our 2022 surveys, with an average participation rate of 79.5%. Across both surveys, an average of 81% of respondents say they feel engaged, and 78% of respondents indicated they feel they can achieve their career goals at IQVIA, which is 4 points better than our prior year survey, and 7 points above the Fortune 500 company benchmark. Other areas where we saw favorable scores were: Employees feeling they are acquiring the knowledge and skills needed to be effective in their jobs (89% and up 3 points from 2021); employees feeling they are part of a team (87% and up 2 points from 2021); and employees agreeing their manager supports their skill and career development (85%).  Diversity and Inclusion. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion (\"D&I\") is reflected in the various policies, programs, training and support we offer, including our Employee Resource Groups (\"ERGs\"), manager diversity and inclusion training and our highly diverse global workforce. This is a foundation of our approach to human capital. We create this culture for employees regardless of gender, race, color, creed, religion, marital status, age, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, veteran status, citizenship, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other protected group status.   15 15 15   Our global workforce operates in over 100 countries and represents approximately 90 different ethnicities. In the United States, approximately 61% of our employees identify as white and approximately 39% identify as a minority, including 12% who identify as Black or African American. Approximately 60% of our employees globally are female and approximately 51% of employees worldwide at a manager level are female.   Our growing network of ERGs provides a framework for employees to connect and collaborate with colleagues with similar interests. These groups support our values and business goals and foster the diverse thinking required for innovation. They provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and opportunities for mentoring and professional development.  There are eight global ERGs, including one new ERG we added in 2022: the Disabilities and Carers Network. All are employee-led, voluntary, and open to every employee. Each ERG has a mission that is aligned to our vision, values, and core operating principles.   \u2022Race, Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage Group (REACH) aims to create a supportive and collaborative community for IQVIA employees who represent racial, ethnic and cultural minorities across the globe.  \u2022Emerging Professionals Network (EPN) builds community among leaders and emerging professionals through networking, personal development and volunteerism in order to pave the way for IQVIA's future growth and success.  \u2022LGBTQIA+ Group (PRIDE) supports the ability for all people at IQVIA to be their authentic selves by fostering an inclusive, equal and inspiring culture for LGBTQIA+ employees.  \u2022Veterans Employee Resource Group (VERG) connects active duty and transitioning service members and veterans at IQVIA while advocating for and supporting active duty and veteran causes that align with IQVIA's core values.  \u2022Women Inspired Network (WIN) fosters a corporate culture that inspires women to excel in their careers at IQVIA and within the biopharma industry.  \u2022Black Leadership Network (BLN) is open to all employees and aims to maintain an inclusive community that supports professional development, knowledge sharing, collaboration and business success for Black employees.  \u2022Multi-Faith Network (MFN) fosters a culture of openness and diversity and provides a place where IQVIA employees can connect with people of different faiths or for mutual support.  \u2022Disabilities and Carers Network (DCN) builds awareness and appreciation around the accomplishments and challenges of the disabled community, to foster inclusion, engagement and professional development.  In 2022, we grew our ERG membership to more than 5,600 participants worldwide, an increase in membership of over 40% from the past year, with chapters established in over 60 countries across the globe.  Employee Well-being. Investing in resources and incentives to promote the personal well-being of our employees and their families is an important way we take care of our people. As a leading global provider of advanced analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research services to the life sciences industry, we also use our own in-house technical expertise to develop online tools to enable our employees to access resources quickly and seamlessly.  We provide a variety of health and welfare benefit plans that are available to employees and their family members, based on their location and specific country regulations. Plans may include medical, dental, and vision coverage; telemedicine and on-site medical care; critical illness coverage; disability, accidental death and dismemberment, pet and life insurance; tuition reimbursement; identity theft protection; commuter benefits; matching gift programs; and locally relevant savings and retirement plans such as pensions and 401(k) plans.  We provide parental leave for all full-time employees for the birth or adoption of a child, with variability in leave time dependent on location. We also provide paid leave for other life matters including sick time, bereavement, jury duty, military service, and time off for voting, depending on country specific policies.  16 16 16   Beyond health and welfare benefits, many regions also offer employee wellness programs. In the United States, our \u201cHealthy You\u201d wellness program offers employees a range of wellness benefits, including free flu shots, teledoc services, nutrition counseling, tobacco cessation support and reimbursement for wellness-related expenses.   Our Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\") is available to 100% of our workforce worldwide. Our EAP offers counseling services, alongside accessible training and webinars focused on a variety of topics including financial planning, nutrition, social connections, stress management, time management and work-life balance. In 2022, we launched a new U.S. EAP, Resources for Living. In addition to counseling services, the program provides digital tools to self-manage a variety of mental health needs. In the U.K., we partnered with AXA to give employees access to the AXA health app and other online well-being programs via our EAP.  Compensation and Benefits. IQVIA compensation programs support our overall strategy by linking employee compensation with both business and personal performance. This approach to compensation demonstrates our \u201cpay for performance\u201d philosophy, as well as our focus on providing compensation programs that attract, retain and motivate and reward employees. In addition to the benefits described above, our compensation programs include base salaries, annual bonuses, and long-term incentive awards.  Talent and Learning. Helping our people grow, develop, and reach their full potential is a key component of our human capital management strategy. Nurturing talent is critical in a highly competitive industry, and it also keeps our employees motivated and engaged.   We invest in our employees\u2019 development throughout their careers at IQVIA through our various talent and learning initiatives. Our strategy is focused on supporting business growth, optimizing our offerings through enhanced digital tools, and building the future leaders of IQVIA. At the same time, we are working to transform the employee experience and evolve our performance management approach to be more responsive to our employees\u2019 experiences. Mirroring our overall culture, our approach to talent and learning is underpinned by the philosophy of empowerment, and we encourage all employees to take ownership of their careers.   We offer a suite of formal and informal learning opportunities, many which focus on business specific topics such as regulatory compliance, technology, analytics, clinical and therapy areas, and more. In 2021, we centralized all of our learning opportunities and provided access to all trainings to every employee worldwide through our Talent and Learning hub. Democratizing our training has given all employees a common, one-stop shop for all their talent and learning needs. There were more than 1.3 million visits worldwide to our Talent and Learning hub in 2022. The ease of access to training has resulted in the completion of over 1.8 million e-learning programs in various subjects, including technology, client-facing skills and project management skills.  We want our employees to have meaningful careers, and we are committed to the idea that career development is a result of growth through new experiences. To foster this growth, we engage employees on their purpose, strengths, and agility. We encourage employees to remain curious and flexible towards their career, exploring opportunities across the organization. Employees take ownership for their development in partnership with managers, mentors, and others. Similarly, performance management is driven by ongoing conversations about priorities, contributions and development.   In 2020, we introduced our Future Leaders Program, a robust training aimed to develop the next generation of leadership at IQVIA. In 2022, 83 senior leaders from 21 countries participated in the four-month virtual program. Sessions consisted of live webinars co-led by senior executives, peer coaching, business projects and skills assessments. Feedback continues to be positive with the program being rated highly by participants, scoring an average of 4.2 out of 5.  In 2021, we piloted our Emerging Leaders Program, targeted to employees at the manager level. In 2022, a total of 302 employees from 40 countries undertook 8,358 hours of training taught by business leaders and subject matter experts from across the organization, covering topics such as agility, collaboration, executive presence and decision making. In addition, participants received peer coaching, 360-degree assessments and individual development plans. In 2022, we switched from 100% virtual trainings for the program to a blended format, including in-person kick-off events for cohorts. We also moved to an approach that combines global and regional business unit participation, to promote cross functional collaboration and networking.  In 2022, we introduced the Leader of the Future initiative to identify and build the skills needed across the organization to lead in a hybrid environment. The initiative was launched in June to all people managers. Since its inception, nearly 4,600 leaders have participated in the initiative and taken advantage of the various resources provided to develop their skills.  17 17 17   Health and Safety. Ensuring the health and safety of our employees is essential, whether they work in our corporate offices or labs. We strive to create a culture of safety so our employees can remain healthy and productive.   We incorporate environmental laws and regulations into our policies and procedures throughout our organization. At the corporate level, we have group certifications to ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018. In accordance with both certifications, we have a robust, integrated Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (\"EHSMS\") with supporting standard operating procedures in place, which demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement. Under our EHSMS, all employees must actively participate in helping to maintain a safe, healthy, and secure work environment. Our Code of Conduct describes the obligations of employees to maintain such an environment, follow all applicable safety and security rules and complete required training.   Q2 Solutions (a wholly-owned subsidiary) operates laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, Singapore, India, Japan, and China. Q2 facilities are certified to ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018.
