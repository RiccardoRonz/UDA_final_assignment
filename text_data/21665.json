We sell our toothpastes under brands such as Colgate, Darlie, elmex, hello, meridol, Sorriso and Tom\u2019s of Maine, our toothbrushes under brands such as Colgate, Darlie, elmex and meridol and our mouthwashes under brands such as Colgate, elmex and meridol.\u00a0Our Oral Care business also includes pharmaceutical products for dentists and other oral health professionals.  We are a leader in many product categories of the Personal Care market with global leadership in liquid hand soap, according to market share data, which we sell under brands such as Palmolive, Protex and Softsoap. Our Personal Care products also include Irish Spring, Palmolive and Protex bar soaps, Irish Spring, Palmolive, Sanex and Softsoap shower gels, Lady Speed Stick, Sanex, Speed Stick and Tom\u2019s of Maine deodorants and antiperspirants, EltaMD, Filorga and PCA SKIN skin health products and Palmolive shampoos and conditioners.   We manufacture and market a wide array of products for the Home Care market, including Ajax, Axion and Palmolive dishwashing liquids and Ajax, Fabuloso and Murphy household cleaners. We are a market leader in fabric conditioners with leading brands, including Suavitel in Latin America, Soupline in Europe, and Cuddly in the South Pacific, according to market share data.  Sales of Oral, Personal and Home Care products accounted for 43%, 19% and 17%, respectively, of our total worldwide Net sales in 2022. Geographically, Oral Care is a significant part of our business in Asia Pacific,\u00a0comprising approximately 82% of Net sales in that region for 2022.  Through our Hill\u2019s Pet Nutrition segment (\u201cHill\u2019s\u201d or \u201cPet Nutrition\u201d), we are a world leader in specialty pet nutrition products for dogs and cats with products marketed in over 80 countries and territories worldwide. Hill\u2019s markets pet foods primarily under two brands. Hill\u2019s Science Diet, which is called Hill\u2019s Science Plan in Europe, is a range of products for everyday nutritional needs. Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet is a range of therapeutic pet foods to help nutritionally support dogs and cats in various different stages of health. Sales of Pet Nutrition products accounted for 21% of our total worldwide Net sales in 2022.  For more information regarding our worldwide Net sales by product category, refer to Note 1, Nature of Operations and Note 14, Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   For additional information regarding market share data, see \u201cMarket Share Information\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this report.  1 1 1   Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents  Our Oral, Personal and Home Care products are sold to a variety of traditional and eCommerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors worldwide. Pet Nutrition products are sold by authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. Certain of our products are also sold direct-to-consumer. Our sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 11% of our Net sales in\u00a02022. No other customer represents more than 10% of our Net sales. We support our products with advertising, promotion and other marketing (with increasing emphasis on digital) to build awareness and trial of our products. Our products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers.  The majority of raw and packaging materials used in our products are purchased from other companies and are available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of our total material requirements.\u00a0We do, however, purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors - Volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability\u201d and Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d   Our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased retail trade concentration, the substantial growth of eCommerce, the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. Products similar to those that we produce and sell are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and around the world. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models. In certain geographies, we also face strong local competitors, who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than we do. Private label brands sold by retailers are also a source of competition for certain of our products.   The retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of eCommerce, changing consumer behavior and preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. We face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new products and brand introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels. Product quality, innovation, brand recognition, marketing capability and acceptance of new products and brands largely determine success in Colgate's operating segments.  We consider trademarks to be of material importance to our business. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where our products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, elmex, hello, meridol, Sorriso, Tom\u2019s of Maine, EltaMD, Filorga, Irish Spring, Lady Speed Stick, PCA SKIN, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Murphy, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill\u2019s Science Diet and Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet. Our rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and/or registered. Although we actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole.             2 2 2   COVID-19  The COVID-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have had and continue to have an impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced and may in the future experience \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to address the pandemic. While the impact of COVID-19 on our business has largely abated at this time, uncertainties continue, particularly in China where we have substantial manufacturing facilities and business, and in the travel retail channel, where we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions particularly in our Filorga business. We have also experienced certain disruptions to our global supply chain due to COVID-19, which have impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. In addition, we have witnessed changes in the purchasing patterns of our customers, including a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online. COVID-19 may continue to impact consumers\u2019 behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences.  While we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above, uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 could result in unforeseen additional disruptions to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs.  For additional information regarding COVID-19\u2019s impact on our business, see Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Executive Overview.\u201d  Government Regulations  As a global company, we are subject to extensive governmental regulations, including environmental rules and regulations, in the U.S. and abroad. The most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. It is our policy and practice to comply with all government regulations applicable to our business. In 2022, compliance with these regulations did not have, and we do not expect such compliance in the future to have, a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. For further discussion of how global legal and regulatory requirements may impact our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d   Product Development: Legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, packaging content, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising, sale and environmental impact. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational, Health and Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas.   Anti-Corruption, Anti-Bribery, Commercial Bribery and Competition: We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage, and laws that prohibit commercial bribery. In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad.  Privacy and Data Protection: Our collection, storage, transfer and/or processing of customer, consumer, employee, vendor and other stakeholder information and personal data is subject to important data protection laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, including the General Data Protection Regulation.  Trade Compliance: We are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S., including, without limitation, those imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), and/or by other jurisdictions that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted. For information regarding the impact of the war in Ukraine, refer to Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview\u201d    3 3 3   Human Capital Management  Human capital matters at Colgate are managed by our Global Human Resources function, led by our Chief Human Resources Officer, with oversight from the Personnel and Organization Committee of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 33,800 employees based in over 100 countries. Approximately two-thirds of our revenues are generated from markets outside the U.S. and 86% of our employees are located outside the U.S. Approximately 36% of our employees are based in Asia Pacific, 30% are based in Latin America, 15% are based in Europe, 14% are based in North America and 5% are based in Africa/Eurasia. Our global workforce covers a broad range of functions, from manufacturing employees to management personnel and certain of our employees are represented by unions or works councils.  Colgate\u2019s Culture and Core Values  As we work to achieve Colgate\u2019s purpose to reimagine a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet, Colgate people, working around the world, share a commitment to our three core corporate values: Caring, Global Teamwork and Continuous Improvement. These values are reflected not only in the quality of our products and reputation, but also in our dedication to serving the communities where we live and work, as reflected in our sustainability and social impact and DE&I strategies. With these values, we work to maintain a strong culture based on integrity, ethical behavior and a commitment to doing the right thing. Underlying these values and our strong culture is the commitment of all Colgate people to maintain the highest ethical standards and demonstrate ethical leadership, including compliance with Colgate policies and our Code of Ethics.  CARING: We care about people - Colgate people, consumers, customers, stockholders, business partners and people in the communities where we live and work. We are committed to acting with compassion, integrity, honesty and high ethics in all situations and to providing our employees with an innovative and inclusive work environment.   GLOBAL TEAMWORK: All Colgate people are part of a global team, committed to working and collaborating together across functions and countries. Only by sharing ideas, technologies and talents can we achieve and sustain profitable growth.  CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT: We are committed to getting better every day in all that we do, as individuals and as teams. We continue to drive a learning culture and transform our learning strategy to better meet our evolving business needs. We provide our employees with learning experiences focused on building leadership skills and offer training programs that are closely aligned with our business strategy. Specifically, we continue to embed new ways of working and leadership principles to, among other things, instill a growth mindset to drive innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitalization. Colgate people are embracing data and analytics as part of their jobs, and we are scaling new capabilities worldwide. In 2022, approximately 14,000 Colgate people completed a new Data Literacy & Analytics Academy course we created with training experts. We are also committed to listening to our employees and seeing how the company is evolving and growing through regular employee engagement surveys.  Diversity, Equity & Inclusion   We believe our people are crucial to our ongoing business success and aim to recruit, develop and retain strong and diverse talent. We celebrate differences, promote an equitable and inclusive environment and value the contributions of all Colgate people. At Colgate, we are proud of our collaborative spirit \u2013 what we call The Power of WE. As a truly global company, we are working to ensure that our workforce reflects the diversity of the communities in which we live and work. As of December 31, 2022, our global workforce was approximately 59% male and 41% female. Women represented approximately 54% of our salaried and clerical employees, 44% of our people managers, 42% of Colgate\u2019s executives and 36% of senior leadership. Measuring the race/ethnicity of our workforce is challenging to do on a global basis. In the U.S., on an employee self-reported basis, the racial/ethnic composition of our workforce was approximately 68% White, 12% Hispanic, 9% Asian, 9% Black, and 2% Other. The racial/ethnic composition of our people managers was approximately 61% White, 16% Hispanic, 14% Asian and 9% Black; the composition of our executives was approximately 58% White, 19% Hispanic, 15% Asian, 7% Black, and 1% Other; and the composition of senior leadership was approximately 61% White, 15% Hispanic, 12% Asian and 12% Black. \u201cOther\u201d refers to American Indian/Alaska Native, two or more races or Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander.

A vital piece of our DE&I strategy has been ensuring that our succession planning process incorporates the advancement of women and people of all cultures, including underrepresented communities. To help further foster inclusiveness, we support employee resource groups for team members of many different identities, interests and backgrounds, including underrepresented communities. Each of these resource groups contributes to our inclusive work environment by developing and implementing programs to promote business and community involvement as well as cultural awareness. We also partner with external organizations to develop an inclusive and supportive work environment.  Our global DE&I strategy aims to further advance our commitment to become an even more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization. The four pillars of our strategy are People, Community, Supplier Diversity and Communication. Consistent with this strategy, we are working to implement policies, learning experiences and processes that promote awareness, empathy, advocacy and opportunity; become an ally for positive change for the underserved in communities in which we live and work; support minority and women-owned suppliers to enable success of diversity-owned businesses; and promote dialogue around DE&I to increase awareness and advance the culture change to achieve our vision. In addition, we continued mandatory allyship and unconscious bias training for all salaried and clerical employees at Colgate that was first introduced in 2021 to help our employees better understand DE&I concepts and embed allyship as a daily practice. Our Board, through its Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and Personnel and Organization Committee, receives regular updates from management on our DE&I efforts.  Succession Planning  We have a rigorous succession planning process, led by our Global Human Resources function. Our Board is also extensively involved in succession planning and people development with special focus on CEO succession. As part of the succession planning process, we review and discuss potential successors to key positions and examine backgrounds, capabilities and appropriate developmental assignments.   Compensation Philosophy  Given the importance of Colgate people to our business success, motivating and retaining critical talent is a key focus. We view compensation as an important tool to motivate leaders at all levels of the organization. For information regarding our compensation philosophy and executive compensation programs, please see our Proxy Statement to be filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) in connection with the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.   Sustainability  We view sustainability as being critically important to our overall business and growth strategy. Our 2025 Sustainability & Social Impact Strategy, which we announced in November 2020, is focused on three key ambitions - preserving our environment by accelerating action on climate change and reducing our environmental footprint; helping millions of homes by empowering people to develop healthier habits; and driving social impact with a commitment to helping to ensure the well-being of all people and their pets. These ambitions are supported by actionable targets consistent with our continued commitment to building environmental and social consciousness into our decision-making.  In 2022, we made progress on the targets set forth in our 2025 Sustainability & Social Impact Strategy.  Reduce Plastic Waste: As a positive step toward achieving our targets to reduce the use of new plastic by a third and make our packaging 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025, we are implementing our first-of-its-kind recyclable toothpaste tube across our toothpaste portfolio. Since introducing our first-of-its-kind recyclable toothpaste tube in 2019, as of December 31, 2022, we have transitioned over 70% of our toothpaste SKUs in North America to recyclable tubes. We continue to share the tube technology and, as of December\u00a031, 2022, we have shared it with third parties by holding approximately 70 sessions to encourage recyclability of all tubes in practice and at scale. We are committed to the success of Colgate Keep, our first-of-its-kind manual toothbrush with a replaceable head and a reusable aluminum handle for 80% less plastic waste compared to similarly sized Colgate toothbrushes.  5 5 5   Accelerate Action on Climate Change: Colgate is taking steps to accelerate action on climate change through science-based near-term, long-term and Net Zero 2040 emissions targets across our operations and supply chain, which have been approved by The Science Based Targets initiative. To support our goal to become Net Zero carbon in our operations by 2040, we have built a global renewable energy master plan which includes roadmaps by division to cover our manufacturing facilities and owned warehouses, global technology centers and offices and have engaged our priority Tier 1 Suppliers in support of our goal to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2025 (versus a 2020 baseline).  Lead with Zero Waste Facilities: It is our goal to achieve TRUE Zero Waste certifications at 100% of our operations, which we define as our manufacturing facilities, owned and operated warehouses, global technology centers and strategic offices, by 2025. In 2022, six more of our sites achieved TRUE certification. That brings the total number of TRUE certified sites, as of December 31, 2022, to 32 across five continents in 19 countries.   Ingredient Transparency: We continue to promote ingredient transparency and seek to follow the highest safety and efficacy standards as we formulate our products. We have rolled out a new \u201cFragrance & Flavors Share for Good\u201d ingredient transparency program, which provides additional ingredient information.  Social Impact: Colgate Bright Smiles, Bright Futures is our flagship oral health education and well-being initiative. Since the program was established in 1991, we have reached over 1.6 billion children and their families in more than 80 countries. Through our Hill's Food, Shelter & Love program, we have helped over 13 million shelter pets find forever homes since 2002.
