{"cik": 1403161, "item_1A": "ITEM\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business OVERVIEW Visa is one of the world\u2019s leaders in digital payments. Our purpose is to uplift everyone, everywhere by being the best way to pay and be paid. We facilitate global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies. Since Visa\u2019s early days in 1958, we have been in the business of facilitating payments between consumers and businesses. We are focused on extending, enhancing and investing in our proprietary advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, to offer a single connection point for facilitating payment transactions to multiple endpoints through various form factors. As a network of networks enabling global movement of money through all available networks, we are working to provide payment solutions and services for everyone, everywhere. Through our network, we offer products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. \u2022We facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement among consumers, issuing and acquiring financial institutions and merchants. We have traditionally referred to this structure as the \u201cfour-party\u201d model. Please see Our Core Business discussion below. As the payments ecosystem continues to evolve, we have broadened this model to include digital banks, digital wallets and a range of financial technology companies (fintechs), governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We provide transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our financial institution and merchant clients through VisaNet. During fiscal year 2023, 276 billion payments and cash transactions with Visa\u2019s brand were processed by Visa or other networks, equating to an average of 757 million transactions per day. Of the 276 billion total transactions, 213 billion were processed by Visa. \u2022We offer a wide range of Visa-branded payment products that our clients, including 14,500 financial institutions, use to develop and offer payment solutions or services, including credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for individual, business and government account holders. During fiscal year 2023, Visa\u2019s total payments and cash volume was $15 trillion, and 4.3 billion payment credentials, which are issued Visa card accounts that were available worldwide to be used at more than 130 million merchant locations.(1) \u2022We take an open partnership approach and seek to provide value by enabling access to our global network, including offering our technology capabilities through application programming interfaces (APIs). We partner with both traditional and emerging players to innovate and expand the payments ecosystem, allowing them to use the resources of our platform to scale and grow their businesses more quickly and effectively.  \u2022We are accelerating the migration to digital payments through our network of networks strategy. We aim to provide a single connection point so that Visa clients can enable money movement for businesses, governments and consumers, regardless of which network is used to start or complete the transaction. This model ultimately helps to unify a complex payments ecosystem. Visa\u2019s network of networks approach creates opportunities by facilitating person-to-person (P2P), business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) and government-to-consumer (G2C) payments, in addition to consumer to business (C2B) payments. \u2022We provide value added services to our clients, including issuing solutions, acceptance solutions, risk and identity solutions, open banking and advisory services. \u2022We invest in and promote our brand to the benefit of our clients and partners through advertising, promotional and sponsorship initiatives with the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee and the National Football League (NFL), among others. We also use these sponsorship assets to showcase our payment innovations.  (1) The number includes an estimated 30 million locations through payment facilitators, which are technology providers that provide payment acceptance services to merchants on behalf of acquirers. Data provided to Visa by acquiring institutions and other third parties as of June 30, 2023. 4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents FISCAL YEAR 2023 KEY STATISTICS  (1)Please see Item 7 of this report for a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. OUR CORE BUSINESS  In a typical Visa C2B payment transaction, the consumer purchases goods or services from a merchant using a Visa card or payment product. The merchant presents the transaction data to an acquirer, usually a bank or third-party processing firm that supports acceptance of Visa cards or payment products, for verification and processing. Through VisaNet, the acquirer presents the transaction data to Visa, which in turn sends the transaction data to the issuer to check the account holder\u2019s account balance or credit line for authorization. After the transaction is authorized, the issuer posts the transaction to the consumer\u2019s account and effectively pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange reimbursement fee. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, minus the merchant discount rate (MDR), to the merchant. Visa earns revenue by facilitating money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies. 5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our net revenues in fiscal year 2023 consisted of the following:   SERVICE REVENUESEarned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment servicesOTHER REVENUESConsist mainly of value added services related to advisory, marketing and certain card benefits; license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology; and fees for account holder services, certification and licensingDATA PROCESSING REVENUESEarned for authorization, clearing, settlement; value added services related to issuing, acceptance, and risk and identity solutions; network access; and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globallyCLIENT INCENTIVESPaid to financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners to grow payments volume; increase Visa product acceptance; win merchant routing transactions over to our network; and drive innovationINTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION REVENUESEarned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities  SERVICE REVENUES Earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment services  OTHER REVENUES Consist mainly of value added services related to advisory, marketing and certain card benefits; license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology; and fees for account holder services, certification and licensing  DATA PROCESSING REVENUES Earned for authorization, clearing, settlement; value added services related to issuing, acceptance, and risk and identity solutions; network access; and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally  CLIENT INCENTIVES Paid to financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners to grow payments volume; increase Visa product acceptance; win merchant routing transactions over to our network; and drive innovation   INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION REVENUES Earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities (1)Figure may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Please see Item 7 and Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this report, which include disclosures on how we earn and recognize our revenues. Visa provides payment processing for both non-Visa-branded and Visa-branded card transactions. In the context of non-Visa-branded card transactions, we facilitate payment processing by providing gateway routing services to other payment networks. At the client\u2019s request, we may provide authorization, clearing or settlement services on our network before or after we route the transaction to the other payments network. In those instances, Visa may earn data processing revenues for the specific services provided. In the context of Visa-branded card transactions on our network, we provide authorization, clearing and settlement services and may earn service, data processing, international transaction, or other revenues. Depending on applicable regulations, some payment processors may or may not use our network to process Visa-branded card transactions. If they use our network, we may earn service revenues and data processing revenues. If they do not use our network, we earn only service revenues. Visa is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products nor do we earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, any of these activities. Interchange reimbursement fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits that account holders and merchants derive from participating in our payments networks. Generally, interchange reimbursement fees are paid by acquirers to issuers. We establish default interchange reimbursement fees that apply absent other established settlement terms. These default interchange reimbursement fees are set independently from the revenues we receive from issuers and acquirers. Our acquiring clients are responsible for setting the fees they charge to merchants for the MDR and for soliciting merchants. Visa sets fees to acquirers independently from any fees that acquirers may charge merchants. Therefore, the fees we receive from issuers and acquirers are not derived from interchange reimbursement fees or MDRs.  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Visa\u2019s strategy is to accelerate our revenue growth in consumer payments, new flows and value added services, and fortify the key foundations of our business model.   We seek to accelerate revenue growth in three primary areas \u2014 consumer payments, new flows and value added services.  Consumer Payments We remain focused on moving trillions of dollars of consumer spending in cash and checks to cards and digital accounts on Visa\u2019s network of networks.   Core Products Visa\u2019s growth has been driven by the strength of our core products \u2014 credit, debit and prepaid.  Credit: Credit cards and digital credentials allow consumers and businesses to access credit to pay for goods and services. Credit cards are affiliated with programs operated by financial institution clients, co-brand partners, fintechs and affinity partners.  Debit: Debit cards and digital credentials allow consumers and small businesses to purchase goods and services using funds held in their deposit accounts. Debit cards enable account holders to transact in person, online or via mobile without needing cash or checks and without accessing a line of credit. The Visa/PLUS Global ATM network also provides debit, credit and prepaid account holders with cash access, and other banking capabilities, in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide through issuing and acquiring partnerships with both financial institutions and independent ATM operators. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Prepaid: Prepaid cards and digital credentials draw from a designated balance funded by individuals, businesses or governments. Prepaid cards address many use cases and needs, including general purpose reloadable, payroll, government and corporate disbursements, healthcare, gift and travel. Visa-branded prepaid cards also play an important part in financial inclusion, bringing payment solutions to those with limited or no access to traditional banking products.  Enablers We enable consumer payments and help our clients grow as digital commerce, new technologies and new participants continue to transform the payments ecosystem. Some examples include: Tap to Pay  As we seek to improve the user experience in the face-to-face environment, contactless payments or tap to pay, which is the process of tapping a contactless card or mobile device on a terminal to make a payment, has emerged as a preferred way to pay among consumers in many countries around the world. Tap to pay adoption is growing and many consumers have come to expect touchless payment experiences.  Globally, we have 50 countries and territories with more than 90 percent contactless penetration and more than 100 countries and territories where tap to pay is more than 50 percent of face-to-face transactions. Excluding the United States, 76 percent of face-to-face transactions globally were contactless in fiscal year 2023. In the U.S., Visa has surpassed 40 percent contactless penetration and more than 520 million tap-to-pay-enabled Visa cards. We have activated more than 750 contactless public transport projects worldwide. In addition, we processed more than 1.6 billion contactless transactions on global transit systems in fiscal year 2023, an increase of more than 30 percent year over year.  Tokenization  Visa Token Service (VTS) brings trust to digital commerce innovation. As consumers increasingly rely on digital transactions, VTS is designed to enhance the digital ecosystem through improved authorization, reduced fraud and improved consumer experience. VTS helps protect digital transactions by replacing 16-digit Visa account numbers with a token that includes a surrogate account number, cryptographic information and other data to protect the underlying account information. This security technology can work for a variety of payment transactions, both in person or online.  The provisioning of network tokens continues to accelerate. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, Visa provisioned more than 7.5 billion network tokens, surpassing the number of physical cards in circulation. The milestone reinforces Visa\u2019s commitment to secure, reliable and efficient money movement, in person and online.  Click to Pay  Click to Pay provides a simplified and more consistent cardholder checkout experience online by removing time-consuming key entry of personal information and enabling consumer and transaction data to be passed securely between payments network participants. Based on the EMV\u00ae Secure Remote Commerce industry standard, Click to Pay brings a standardized and streamlined approach to online checkout and meets the needs of consumers shopping across a growing number of connected devices. The goal of Click to Pay is to make digital payments as secure, reliable and interoperable as the checkout experience in person. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents New Flows New flows focus on facilitating commercial and global money movement across Visa\u2019s network of networks. This approach creates opportunities to capture new sources of money movement through card and non-card flows for consumers, businesses and governments around the world by facilitating P2P, B2C, B2B and G2C payments.   Visa Direct Visa Direct is part of Visa\u2019s strategy beyond C2B payments and helps facilitate the delivery of funds to eligible cards, deposit accounts and digital wallets across more than 190 countries and territories. Visa Direct supports multiple use cases, such as P2P payments and account-to-account transfers, business and government payouts to individuals or small businesses, merchant settlements and refunds. Visa Direct utilizes more than 70 domestic payment schemes, 10 real-time payments schemes, 15 card-based networks and five payment gateways, with the potential to reach more than 8.5 billion cards, deposit accounts and digital wallets. In fiscal year 2023, Visa Direct processed more than 7.5 billion transactions across more than 2,800 global programs. Visa Direct solutions supported more than 500 partners across more than 65 use cases. We also announced in fiscal year 2023 Visa\u2019s partnership with DailyPay, i2C, PayPal, TabaPay, Venmo and Western Union to pilot Visa+, an innovative service that aims to help individuals send money quickly and securely between different participating P2P digital payment apps.  We continue to build on our network of networks strategy by investing in our own capabilities with Visa+ and Visa Alias Directory Service, which offers capabilities to our clients to link aliases, such as mobile numbers or email addresses, to payment credentials, as well as strategically collaborating with digital and mobile payment providers to expand the reach of Visa Direct and deliver even stronger domestic and cross-border payment and connection capabilities to our clients. Visa Commercial Solutions We are also expanding our network with B2B payments. Our three strategic areas of focus include investing in and growing card-based payments, accelerating our efforts in non-card, cross-border payments and digitizing domestic accounts payable and accounts receivable processes. We offer a portfolio of commercial payment solutions, including small business, corporate (travel) cards, purchasing cards, virtual cards and digital credentials, non-card cross-border B2B payment options and disbursement accounts, covering most major industry segments around the world.

Visa B2B Connect is a multilateral B2B cross-border payments network designed to facilitate transactions from the bank of origin directly to the beneficiary bank, helping streamline settlement and optimize payments for financial institutions\u2019 corporate clients. The network delivers B2B cross-border payments that are reliable, flexible, data-rich, secure and cost-effective. Visa B2B Connect continues to scale and is available in more than 100 countries and territories.  Visa Cross-Border Solutions  Formerly Treasury as a Service, Visa Cross-Border Solutions aligns with our global network of networks strategy, as we are focused on building the infrastructure that enables our clients of all sizes to deliver cross-border products with visibility, speed and security. This includes a series of solutions for our established cross-border consumer payments business, as well as use cases enabled by our digitally native Currencycloud platform, which includes real-time foreign exchange rates, virtual accounts, and enhanced liquidity and settlement capabilities.  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Value Added Services Value added services represent an opportunity for us to diversify our revenue with products and solutions that differentiate our network, deepen our client relationships and deliver innovative solutions across other networks.

Additionally, Visa provides loyalty and benefits solution to issuers aimed at creating compelling and differentiated cardholder experiences, as well as Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) capabilities. BNPL or installment payments allow shoppers the flexibility to pay for a purchase in equal payments over a defined period of time. Visa is investing in installments as a payments strategy \u2014 by offering a portfolio of BNPL solutions for traditional clients, as well as installments providers, who use our cards and services to support a wide variety of installment options before, during or after checkout, in person and online. Acceptance Solutions Visa Acceptance Solutions, which includes Cybersource, provides modular, value added services in addition to the traditional gateway function of connecting merchants to payment processing. Using the platform, acquirers, payment service providers, independent software vendors, and merchants of all sizes can improve the way their consumers engage and transact; help to mitigate fraud and lower operational costs; and adapt to changing business requirements. They can also connect with other fintechs through a global payment management platform to use their services.

Solutions such as Visa Advanced Authorization, Visa Secure, Visa Risk Manager and Decision Manager, Visa Consumer Authentication Service, and payment-decisioning solutions from CardinalCommerce empower financial institutions and merchants with tools that help automate and simplify fraud prevention and enhance payment security. Aligned to our network of networks strategy, Visa is increasingly bringing our expertise and capabilities to emerging fraud challenges, working with network operators and financial institutions to help mitigate fraud. These value-added fraud prevention tools layer on top of a suite of our network programs that protect the safety and integrity of the payment ecosystem, and along with our investments in intelligence and technology, help to prevent, detect and mitigate threats. These programs and Visa\u2019s fraud prevention expertise are among the core benefits of  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents being part of the Visa network. Through the combined efforts of security and identity tools and services, payment and cyber intelligence, insights and learnings from client or partner breach investigations, and law enforcement engagement, Visa helps protect financial institutions and merchants from fraud and solve payment security challenges.\u00a0 Open Banking In March 2022, Visa acquired Tink AB, an open banking platform, to catalyze fintech innovation and accelerate the development and adoption of open banking securely and at scale. Visa\u2019s open banking capabilities range from data access use cases, such as account verification, balance check and personal finance management, to payment initiation capabilities, such as account-to-account transactions and merchant payments.

We are fortifying the key foundations of our business model, which consist of becoming a network of networks, our technology platforms, security, brand and talent.   Network of Networks Our network of networks strategy means moving money to all endpoints and to all form factors, using all available networks and being a single connection point for our partners; and providing our value added services on all transactions, no matter the network. The key component of our network of networks strategy is interoperability. We are opening up our network and increasingly using other networks to reach accounts we could not otherwise reach and enabling new types of money movement. Visa B2B Connect, Visa Direct, and Visa+ are examples of our strategy.  Technology Platforms Visa\u2019s leading technology platforms comprise software, hardware, data centers and a\u00a0large\u00a0telecommunications infrastructure.\u00a0Visa\u2019s four data centers are a critical part of our global processing environment and have a high redundancy of network connectivity, power and cooling designed to provide continuous availability of systems.

Brand Visa\u2019s strong brand helps deliver added value to our clients and their customers, financial institutions, merchants and partners through compelling brand expressions, a wide range of products and services as well as innovative brand and marketing efforts. In line with our commitment to an expansive and diverse range of partnerships for the benefit of our stakeholders, Visa is a sponsor of top entertainment and sports events including the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup 2023TM, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the Super Bowl. Talent Attracting, developing and advancing the best talent globally is critical to our continued success. This year we grew our total workforce from approximately 26,500 in fiscal year 2022 to approximately 28,800 employees in fiscal year 2023, an increase of 9 percent year over year. Voluntary workforce turnover (rolling 12-month attrition) was 6 percent as of September 30, 2023. Visa employees are located in more than 80 countries and territories, with 55 percent located outside the U.S. At the end of fiscal year 2023, Visa\u2019s global workforce was 58 percent men and 42 percent women, and women represented 36 percent of Visa\u2019s leadership (defined as vice president level and above). In the U.S., ethnicity of our workforce was 42 percent Asian, 8 percent Black, 13 percent Hispanic, 3 percent Other and 35 percent White. For our U.S. leadership, the breakdown was 18 percent Asian, 6 percent Black, 13 percent Hispanic, 3 percent Other and 60 percent White.  Given Visa\u2019s ambitious growth agenda and efforts to achieve our purpose, we have focused on enhancing our employees\u2019 expertise across our business. This includes an enhanced development program for our senior leaders and a formal technology apprenticeship program to help us broaden and strengthen our talent channels and pipelines. We have also committed to providing employees with the tools they need to do their work more quickly and easily, including an artificial intelligence or AI-driven portal with a searchable knowledge base to create customized results and bespoke solutions. We enhanced our mental well-being and retirement benefits, which is reflective of our key priority to take care of our employees. We also are dedicated to ensuring that employees feel valued in their day-to-day work. During our global employee engagement survey last year, we learned that our employees wanted more opportunities to recognize and be recognized, in more informal ways. In response, Visa developed a program that better enabled employees to provide peer-to-peer recognition for each other\u2019s contributions. Using UPLIFT, Visa\u2019s new recognition platform, employees can celebrate their peers\u2019 achievements, send e-cards to celebrate the employee journey (from welcoming new hires to recognizing service anniversaries), use an automated internal networking tool that matches employees based on smart algorithms, and more. Importantly, all our recognition categories are grounded in behaviors that reflect our employee value proposition or Visa\u2019s Leadership Principles \u2013 further reinforcing that at Visa, it is not only about what you achieve, but how you do it. Employee engagement in peer recognition has significantly increased since the launch, with monthly active users reaching 78 percent in September 2023, compared to 45 percent in September 2022. With this enhanced platform, employees are encouraged to recognize and uplift each other. Visa is committed to pay equity, regardless of gender or race/ethnicity, and conducts pay equity analyses on an annual basis. We are also committed to transparency \u2013 this year, we launched total rewards statements in the United Kingdom in addition to those already provided in Asia, to drive a deeper understanding and appreciation of total rewards value to the individual. We plan to introduce statements in the U.S. as well. For additional information regarding our human capital management, please see the section titled \u201cTalent and Human Capital Management\u201d in Visa\u2019s 2023 Proxy Statement as well as our website at visa.com/esg, which includes enhanced workforce disclosures that include our 2022 Consolidated EEO-1 Report and our 2022 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report. See Available Information below. FINTECH AND DIGITAL PARTNERSHIPS Fintechs are a vital growth engine for Visa and a key driver in realizing our purpose \u2013 to uplift everyone, everywhere by being the best way to pay and be paid. Fintechs are key enablers of new payment experiences and new flows. Our work with fintechs is one of our greatest opportunities and has opened new points of acceptance, extended credit at the point of sale, made cross-border money flows more efficient, moved B2B spend onto Visa\u2019s network, expedited payroll and provided digital wallet customers access to our services. Our portfolio of fintech partners is diverse and continues to grow and scale. We signed more than 500 commercial partnerships with  12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents fintechs globally, from early stage companies to growing and mature players, an increase of 25 percent year over year.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS Visa continually explores opportunities to augment our capabilities and provide meaningful value to our clients. Mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments complement our internal development and enhance our partnerships to align with Visa\u2019s priorities. Visa applies a rigorous business analysis to our acquisitions, joint ventures and investments to ensure they will differentiate our network, provide value added services and accelerate growth. In fiscal year 2023, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo, a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform with operations in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We own and manage the Visa brand, which stands for acceptance, security, convenience, speed and reliability. Our portfolio of Visa-owned trademarks is important to our business. Generally, trademark registrations are valid indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or maintained.\u00a0We give our clients access to these assets through agreements with our issuers and acquirers, which authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. Additionally, we own a number of patents and patent applications related to our business and continue to pursue patents in emerging technologies that may have applications in our business.\u00a0We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. COMPETITION  The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. Existing and emerging competitors compete with Visa\u2019s network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants. Technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, blockchain technology and digital currencies. These advances are enabling new entrants, many  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents of which depart from traditional network payment models. In certain countries, the evolving regulatory landscape is creating local networks or enabling additional processing competition. We compete against all forms of payment. This includes paper-based payments, primarily cash and checks, and all forms of electronic payments. Our electronic payment competitors principally include:  Global or Multi-Regional Networks: These networks typically offer a range of branded, general purpose card payment products that consumers can use at millions of merchant locations around the world. Examples include American Express, Discover, JCB, Mastercard and UnionPay. These competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as Discover in the U.S. and JCB in Japan, or have a leading position in certain countries, such as UnionPay in China. See Item 1A\u2014Regulatory Risks\u2014Government-imposed obligations and/or restrictions on international payments systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as China and India. Based on available data, Visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world.

Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Local and Regional Networks: Operated in many countries, these networks often have the support of government influence or mandate. In some cases, they are owned by financial institutions or payment processors. These networks typically focus on debit payment products, and may have strong local acceptance, and recognizable brands. Examples include NYCE, Pulse and STAR in the U.S., Interac in Canada and eftpos in Australia.  Alternative Payments Providers: These providers, such as closed commerce ecosystems, BNPL solutions and cryptocurrency platforms, often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels; however, they are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale. These companies may process payments using in-house account transfers between parties, electronic funds transfer networks like the ACH, global or local networks like Visa, or some combination of the foregoing. In some cases, these entities can be both a partner and a competitor to Visa. Real-time Payment (RTP) Networks: RTP networks have launched in multiple markets and continue to be driven by strong government sponsorship and regulatory initiatives to enable and drive adoption (e.g., FedNow in the U.S., PIX in Brazil and United Payments Interface (UPI) in India), increasing their position as an alternative to payment card schemes. These networks primarily focus on domestic transactions, with adoption varying by use cases and geographies. However, with linkages such as PayNow in Singapore and UPI in India, cross-border RTP networks are advancing and will compete with our cross-border business. RTP networks can compete with Visa on consumer payments and other payment flows (e.g., B2B and P2P) but can also be customers for value added services, such as risk management.  Digital Wallet Providers: They continue to expand payment capabilities in person and online for consumers and merchants and provide consumers with additional ways to pay. While digital wallets can help drive Visa volumes, they can also be funded by non-card payment options. Digital wallet providers who utilize RTP networks provide additional competition. Payment Processors: Payment processors may perform processing services on third-party payments networks on behalf of issuers or acquirers. We compete with payment processors for the processing of Visa transactions. These processors may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents regulation. For example, as a result of regulation in Europe under the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR), we may face competition from other networks, processors and other third parties who could process Visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. New Flows Providers: We compete with alternative solutions to our new flows (e.g., Visa Direct and Visa B2B Connect) such as ACH, RTP and wires. We compete with other global and local card networks for commercial card portfolios. Additionally, we may face competition from financial institution clients who are experimenting with B2B blockchain payments. Value Added Service Providers: We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value added services. This includes a wide range of players, such as technology companies, information services and consulting firms, governments and merchant services companies. The integration of technology like generative AI can create new and better offerings that compete with our value added services, such as strengthened risk monitorization and managing digital identification. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in these areas. We believe our fundamental value proposition of security, convenience, speed and reliability as well as the number of credentials and our acceptance footprint help us to succeed. In addition, we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions, merchants, fintechs, governments, NGOs and business organizations to provide tailored and innovative solutions. We will continue to utilize our network of networks strategy to facilitate the movement of money. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively due to our global brand, our broad set of payment products, new flows offerings and value added services, and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably. GOVERNMENT REGULATION As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. The most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. For further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A\u2014Regulatory Risks. Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism and Sanctions: We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. We are also subject to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Crimea, and the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic regions of Ukraine), or that are included on OFAC\u2019s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, to issue or acquire Visa cards or engage in transactions using our products and services. Government-Imposed Market Participation Restrictions: Certain governments, including China, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, have taken actions to promote domestic payments systems and/or certain issuers, payments networks or processors, by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers, impose local ownership requirements on processors, require data localization or mandate that domestic processing be done in that country. Interchange Rates and Fees: An increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Act (Dodd-Frank Act) limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions in the U.S.; the European Union (EU) IFR limits interchange rates in the European Economic Area (EEA) (as discussed below); and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Central Bank of Brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange. Internet Transactions: Many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor, identify, filter, restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the Internet, such as gambling, digital currencies, the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol and other controversial transaction types. 15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents Network Exclusivity and Routing: In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Act limits network exclusivity and restrictions on merchant routing choice for the debit and prepaid market segments. Other jurisdictions impose similar limitations, such as the IFR\u2019s prohibition in Europe on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card. No-surcharge Rules: We have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using Visa products instead of other means. However, merchants\u2019 ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as Visa product type, and continues to be impacted by litigation, regulation and legislation. Privacy and Data Protection: Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy, data use and data security regulations, which impact the way we use and handle data, operate our products and services and even impact our ability to offer a product or service. In addition, regulators are proposing new laws or regulations that could require Visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and data-handling practices, create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data. Supervisory Oversight of the Payments Industry: Visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., for example, the Federal Banking Agencies (FBA) (formerly known as the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council) has supervisory oversight over Visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to U.S. financial institutions. The federal banking agencies comprising the FBA are the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration. Visa also may be separately examined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a service provider to the banks that issue Visa-branded consumer credit and debit card products. Central banks in other countries/regions, including Canada, Europe, India, Ukraine and the UK (as discussed below), have recognized or designated Visa as a retail payment system under various types of financial stability regulations. Visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions, such as Brazil and Hong Kong. European and United Kingdom Regulations and Supervisory Oversight: Visa in Europe continues to be subject to complex and evolving regulation in the EEA and the UK.  There are a number of EU regulations that impact our business. As discussed above, the IFR regulates interchange rates within the EEA, requires Visa Europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting, organization and decision-making purposes within the EEA, and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing. National competent authorities in the EEA are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the IFR in their markets. We are also subject to regulations governing areas such as privacy and data protection, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctions. Other regulations in Europe, such as the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), require, among other things, that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging non-financial institution players. PSD2 also includes strong customer authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose both operational complexity on Visa and impact consumer payment experiences. Visa Europe is also subject to supervisory oversight by the European Central Bank and certain competent authorities in Europe. In the UK, Visa Europe is designated as a Recognized Payment System, bringing it within the scope of the Bank of England\u2019s supervisory powers and subjecting it to various requirements, including on issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the UK\u2019s financial system. Visa Europe is also regulated by the UK\u2019s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), which has wide-ranging powers and authority to review our business practices, systems, rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the UK, and ensuring payment systems take care of, and promote, the interests of service-users. Post-Brexit, the UK has adopted various European regulations, including regulations that impact the payments ecosystem, such as the IFR and PSD2. The PSR is responsible for monitoring Visa Europe\u2019s compliance with the IFR as adopted in the UK.  Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability: Certain governments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to corporate responsibility and sustainability performance, transparency and reporting. Regulations may include mandated corporate reporting (e.g., Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) or in individual areas, such as mandated reporting on climate-related financial disclosures.  Additional Regulatory Developments: Various regulatory agencies across the world also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues, including mobile payment transactions, tokenization, access rights for non-financial institutions, money transfer services, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and our business. Furthermore, following the  16 16 16 Table of Contents Table of Contents passage of PSD2 in Europe, several countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong and Mexico, are contemplating granting or have already granted various types of access rights to third-party processors, including access to consumer account data maintained by our financial institution clients. These changes could have negative implications for our business depending on how the regulations are framed and implemented. AVAILABLE INFORMATION Our corporate website is visa.com/ourbusiness.
