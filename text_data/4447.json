We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada.  At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we and our partners have discovered a significant resource base and are executing a multi-phased development of the block.  We currently plan to have six FPSOs with an aggregate expected production capacity of more than 1.2 million gross bopd on the Stabroek Block in 2027, and the potential for up to ten FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base. Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation\u2019s approximate 41% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December\u00a031, 2022, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota.  See\u00a0Midstream on page 11. Exploration and Production Proved Reserves Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, and exclude escalations based on future conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2022 were $94.13 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (2021: $66.34) and $97.98 per barrel for Brent (2021: $68.92).\u00a0\u00a0Our total proved developed and undeveloped reserves at December 31 were as follows: \u00a0Crude\u00a0Oil &\u00a0CondensateNatural Gas LiquidsNatural GasTotal\u00a020222021202220212022202120222021\u00a0(Millions of bbls)(Millions of bbls)(Millions of mcf)(Millions of boe)Developed\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0United States277\u00a0283\u00a0156\u00a0138\u00a0648\u00a0568\u00a0541\u00a0516\u00a0Guyana (a)116\u00a065\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a037\u00a017\u00a0122\u00a068\u00a0Malaysia and JDA3\u00a03\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0304\u00a0394\u00a054\u00a069\u00a0Other (b)\u2014\u00a0100\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a098\u00a0\u2014\u00a0116\u00a0\u00a0396\u00a0451\u00a0156\u00a0138\u00a0989\u00a01,077\u00a0717\u00a0769\u00a0Undeveloped\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0United States206\u00a0215\u00a089\u00a095\u00a0356\u00a0367\u00a0354\u00a0371\u00a0Guyana (a)164\u00a0140\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a054\u00a031\u00a0173\u00a0145\u00a0Malaysia and JDA\u2014\u00a02\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a071\u00a0131\u00a012\u00a024\u00a0\u00a0370\u00a0357\u00a089\u00a095\u00a0481\u00a0529\u00a0539\u00a0540\u00a0Total\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0United States483\u00a0498\u00a0245\u00a0233\u00a01,004\u00a0935\u00a0895\u00a0887\u00a0Guyana (a)280\u00a0205\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a091\u00a048\u00a0295\u00a0213\u00a0Malaysia and JDA3\u00a05\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0375\u00a0525\u00a066\u00a093\u00a0Other (b)\u2014\u00a0100\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a098\u00a0\u2014\u00a0116\u00a0\u00a0766\u00a0808\u00a0245\u00a0233\u00a01,470\u00a01,606\u00a01,256\u00a01,309\u00a0 (a)Guyana natural gas reserves will be consumed for fuel.

Prior to COVID-19, we were operating six rigs in the Bakken, but reduced the rig count to one in May 2020 in response to the sharp decline in crude oil prices.  We added a second operated rig in the Bakken in February 2021, a third operated rig in September 2021, and a fourth operated rig in July 2022.\u00a0\u00a0During 2023, we plan to operate four rigs, drill approximately 110 wells and bring approximately 110 wells on production. Offshore: Gulf of Mexico:\u00a0\u00a0At December\u00a031, 2022, we held approximately 44,000 net developed acres, with our production operations principally at the Baldpate (Hess\u00a050%), Conger (Hess\u00a038%), Llano (Hess\u00a050%), Penn State (Hess\u00a050%), Stampede (Hess 25%) and Tubular Bells (Hess 57%) Fields.\u00a0\u00a0At December 31, 2022, we held approximately 249,000 net undeveloped acres, of which leases covering approximately 172,000 acres are due to expire in the next three\u00a0years.  In 2022, we completed drilling operations on the Huron-1 exploration well located on Green Canyon Block 69 (Hess 40%), where oil bearing reservoirs were encountered.  Well results are being evaluated and an appraisal sidetrack is planned.  In 2023, we plan to participate in four wells which include two exploration wells, and two wells that will be tie-backs to the Stampede Field and Llano Field production platforms. 7 7 7   Guyana Stabroek Block:\u00a0\u00a0The Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, covers approximately 6.6 million acres.\u00a0\u00a0The operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited,\u00a0has made more than 30 discoveries since 2015, with the discovered resources to date on the block expected to underpin the potential for up to ten FPSOs.  The first six FPSOs are expected to have an aggregate expected production capacity of more than 1.2 million gross bopd in 2027. The Liza Phase 1 development began producing oil in December 2019 utilizing the Liza Destiny FPSO and in June 2022 reached its expanded production capacity of more than 140,000 gross bopd from approximately 120,000 gross bopd following the completion of production optimization work.  The Liza Phase 2 development, which began producing oil in February 2022 from the Liza Unity FPSO, reached its expected production capacity of 220,000 gross bopd in July 2022. The third development, Payara, was sanctioned in 2020 and will utilize the Prosperity FPSO, which will have an expected production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected by the end of 2023.  Ten drill centers with a total of 41 wells are planned, including 20 production wells and 21 injection wells. A fourth development, Yellowtail, was sanctioned in April 2022 and will utilize the ONE GUYANA FPSO with an expected production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd, with first production expected in 2025.  Six drill centers are planned with up to 26 production wells and 25 injection wells. A fifth development, Uaru, was submitted to the Government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Pending government approvals and project sanctioning, the project is expected to have a production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd, with first oil anticipated at the end of 2026. In 2022, the operator drilled a total of ten successful exploration and appraisal wells that encountered hydrocarbons and one unsuccessful exploration well, Banjo-1, for which the well costs were expensed.  Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the operator completed one successful exploration well that encountered hydrocarbons, and one unsuccessful exploration well, Fish/Tarpon-1, for which well costs incurred through December 31, 2022 were expensed.  See Note 20, Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2023, the operator plans to utilize six drillships to drill approximately ten exploration and appraisal wells in addition to development wells for the sanctioned developments. Kaieteur Block:  We hold a 20% participating interest in the Kaieteur Block, which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block.  Seismic evaluation and planning for the next exploration well are ongoing. Malaysia and JDA Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA):\u00a0\u00a0Production comes from the Carigali Hess operated Block A-18 in the Malaysia/Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand (Hess\u00a050%).\u00a0\u00a0In 2023, the operator plans to drill approximately eight development wells. Malaysia:\u00a0\u00a0Our production in Malaysia comes from our interest in Block PM302 (Hess 50%) located in the North Malay Basin (NMB), offshore Peninsular Malaysia and Block PM301 (Hess 50%), which is adjacent to and is unitized with Block A\u201118 of the JDA.  In 2023, we plan to continue development activities at NMB, including drilling approximately ten wells. Other Suriname:\u00a0\u00a0We hold a 33% non-operated participating interest in Block 42, offshore Suriname.\u00a0\u00a0In 2022, the operator, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc, drilled the Zanderij-1 exploration well.  The well encountered oil pay and demonstrated a working petroleum system.  Well results continue to be evaluated.  The operator plans to drill one exploration well in 2024.\u00a0\u00a0We also hold a 33% non-operated participating interest in Block 59, offshore Suriname, where the operator, ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Suriname B.V., is processing recently acquired 3D seismic data.

Midstream Prior to December 16, 2019, the Midstream segment was primarily comprised of Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP), a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), formed to own, operate, develop and acquire a diverse set of midstream assets to provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers.\u00a0\u00a0HIP was initially formed on May 21, 2015, with Hess selling 50% of HIP to GIP for approximately $2.6 billion on July 1, 2015. On April 10, 2017, HIP completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 16,997,000 common units, representing 30.5% limited partnership interests in its subsidiary Hess Midstream Partners LP (Hess Midstream Partners), for net proceeds of approximately $365.5 million.\u00a0\u00a0In connection with the IPO, HIP contributed a 20% controlling economic interest in each of Hess North Dakota Pipeline Operations LP, Hess TGP Operations LP, and Hess North Dakota Export Logistics Operations LP, and a 100% economic interest in Hess Mentor Storage Holdings LLC (collectively the \u201cContributed Businesses\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0In exchange for the Contributed Businesses, Hess and GIP each received common and subordinated units representing a direct 33.75% limited partner interest in Hess Midstream Partners and a 50% indirect ownership interest through HIP in Hess Midstream Partners\u2019 general partner, which had a 2% economic interest in Hess Midstream Partners plus incentive distribution rights. On December 16, 2019, Hess Midstream Partners acquired HIP, including HIP\u2019s 80% interest in Hess Midstream Partners\u2019 oil and gas midstream assets, HIP\u2019s water services business and the outstanding economic general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in Hess Midstream Partners.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Hess Midstream Partners\u2019 organizational structure converted from a master limited partnership into an \u201cUp-C\u201d structure in which Hess Midstream Partners\u2019 public unitholders received newly issued Class A shares in a new public entity\u00a0named Hess Midstream LP (Hess Midstream), which is taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.\u00a0\u00a0Hess Midstream Partners changed its name to \u201cHess Midstream Operations LP\u201d (HESM Opco) and became a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream, the new publicly listed entity.\u00a0\u00a0As consideration for the acquisition, Hess received a cash payment of $301 million and approximately 115\u00a0million newly issued HESM Opco Class B units.\u00a0\u00a0After giving effect to the acquisition and related transactions, public shareholders of Class\u00a0A shares in Hess Midstream owned 6% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis and Hess and GIP each owned 47% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis, primarily through the sponsors\u2019 ownership of Class B units in HESM Opco that are exchangeable into Class\u00a0A shares of Hess Midstream on a one-for-one basis. In March 2021, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of 6.9 million Class A shares held by Hess and GIP.  These Class A shares of Hess Midstream were obtained by Hess and GIP through the exchange of 6.9 million of their Class B units of HESM Opco.  In August 2021, HESM Opco repurchased 31.25 million Class B units held by Hess and GIP for $750 million.  Hess received net proceeds of $375 million.  HESM Opco issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.250% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 in a private offering to finance the repurchase.  In October 2021, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of approximately 8.6 million Class A Shares held by Hess and GIP.  These Class A shares of Hess Midstream were obtained by Hess and GIP through the exchange of approximately 8.6 million of their Class B units of HESM Opco. In April 2022, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of approximately 10.2 million Class A shares held by Hess and GIP.  The Class A shares of Hess Midstream were obtained by Hess and GIP through the exchange of approximately 10.2 million of their Class B units of HESM Opco.  Concurrent with the April 2022 public offering, HESM Opco repurchased approximately 13.6\u00a0million HESM Opco Class B units held by Hess and GIP for $400\u00a0million.  HESM Opco issued $400\u00a0million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 in a private offering to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility used to finance the repurchase.   After giving effect to the above transactions, public shareholders of Class A shares of Hess Midstream own approximately 18%, and Hess and GIP each own approximately 41%, of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis at December 31, 2022.

Risk Factors for a discussion of competition and market conditions. Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures We have in place a series of business and asset-specific emergency preparedness, response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities.\u00a0\u00a0These plans are maintained,  12 12 12   reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability.\u00a0\u00a0Where applicable, they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities. Responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans.\u00a0\u00a0Our contractors, service providers, representatives from government agencies and, where applicable, joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented. To complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations, we maintain membership contracts with a network of local, regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations.\u00a0\u00a0At the regional and global level, these organizations include CGA, MSRC, MWCC, WWC and OSRL.\u00a0\u00a0CGA and MSRC are domestic spill response organizations and MWCC provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the Gulf of Mexico.  WWC provides firefighting, well control and engineering services globally.\u00a0\u00a0OSRL is a global response organization and is available, when needed, to assist us with any of our assets.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to owning response assets in their own right, the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required.\u00a0\u00a0OSRL\u2019s response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges, more than 250 skimmers, over 600,000 feet of boom, nine capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment, including aircraft.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to external well control and oil spill response support, we have contracts with wildlife, environmental, meteorology, incident management, medical and security resources.\u00a0\u00a0If we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services, we would fund such services and, where appropriate, seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage, as described below.\u00a0\u00a0In certain circumstances, we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support.\u00a0\u00a0We maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the Executive Committee and Response Network Committee of MWCC, the Technical Operations Committee of CGA and the Oil Spill and Emergency Response Committee of API.  We also maintain regular voting membership in CGA, MSRC and OSRL. We continue to participate in several industry-wide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents, access and control blowouts in subsea environments, and improve containment and recovery methods.\u00a0\u00a0The task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention, preparedness, response and recovery processes. Insurance Coverage and Indemnification We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property, third-party liability, workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability, general liability, sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage.\u00a0\u00a0This insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. The amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event, excluding windstorm coverage for which we are self-insured, varies by asset, based on the asset's estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss.\u00a0\u00a0In the case of a catastrophic event, first\u00a0party coverage consists of two\u00a0tiers of insurance.\u00a0\u00a0The first\u00a0$450\u00a0million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group.\u00a0\u00a0Above this $450\u00a0million threshold, additional insurance is carried which ranges in value up to $540 million in total at December 31, 2022, depending on the asset coverage level, as described above.\u00a0 The insurance programs covering physical damage to our property exclude business interruption protection for our E&P operations.\u00a0Additionally, we carry insurance that provides third-party coverage for general liability, and sudden and accidental pollution, up to $850\u00a0million, which coverage under a standard JOA would be reduced to our participating interest.\u00a0\u00a0Our insurance policies renew at various dates each year.\u00a0\u00a0Future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions, or additional exclusions or limitations.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable. Generally, our drilling contracts (and most of our other offshore services contracts) provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract (the Corporation and contractor) indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property (and, often, those of its contractors/subcontractors) regardless of fault.\u00a0\u00a0Variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party.\u00a0\u00a0Third-party claims, on the other hand, are generally allocated on a fault basis. We are customarily responsible for, and indemnify the contractor against, all claims including those from third parties, to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor\u2019s property.\u00a0\u00a0Variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third-party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs, blowouts, cratering and loss of hole, regardless of cause, although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence and/or willful misconduct do exist.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the  13 13 13   contractor\u2019s liability equal to a fixed negotiated amount.\u00a0\u00a0Variations may include exclusions of all contractual indemnities from the liability cap. Under a standard JOA, each party is liable for all claims arising under the JOA, to the extent of its participating interest (operator or non-operator).\u00a0\u00a0Variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of the operator, in which case the operator is solely liable.\u00a0\u00a0The parties to the JOA may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by third parties in some jurisdictions.\u00a0\u00a0Further, under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties, liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several. Government Regulations The crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels.  Regulations affecting elements of the energy sector are under continuous review for amendment or expansion over time, which may result in incremental costs of doing business and affect our profitability.  See Regulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Compliance with various existing environmental, health and safety regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  However, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products.  We spent approximately $23\u00a0million in 2022 for environmental remediation.  Additionally, we may be exposed to decommissioning liabilities, including for divested assets.  See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses.  For further discussion of environmental, health and safety regulations affecting our business, see Environment, Health and Safety in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Human Capital Management Corporate Culture and Overview Our human capital strategy aims to attract, engage and retain our talent by investing in their professional development and providing them with challenging and rewarding opportunities for personal growth.

We are undertaking a Life at Hess initiative to optimize the work experience for our multigenerational and demographically diverse workforce and unlock the discretionary effort that is required to perform at a high level on a sustained basis.  The Life at Hess framework encompasses programs, policies and practices, and a listening system that draws on in-person dialogues, pulse polls and data analytics to help leaders understand employees\u2019 experiences and perspectives to inform their decision making.

Our continued response to COVID-19 throughout 2022 reflected this commitment and was led by a multidisciplinary Hess emergency response team that implemented processes to reduce the risks of COVID-19 in the work environment while maintaining business continuity.  We continue to adapt our work policies and benefits to prioritize emotional, mental and physical health and well-being.  Accordingly, during 2022, we instituted a hybrid work schedule at our office locations to take a deliberate and measured approach to returning to the physical work environment.   14 14 14   During 2022, we further evolved our Life at Hess initiative, conducting several employee surveys to check employee understanding of and engagement in strategic priorities and learn about their experience in a time of great change.  The work experience continues to evolve through: \u2022in-person and virtual learning opportunities and training, \u2022enhanced education assistance and tuition grant programs, \u2022support for hybrid working effectiveness, \u2022mental well-being support,  \u2022expanded matching gifts and volunteer grants program, \u2022enhanced holiday schedule to include an additional floating holiday for employees to observe other religious days or holidays important to them, and  \u2022leadership training and development to help leaders navigate the complex environment of hybrid working, societal changes, and market dynamics. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion In keeping with our values and purpose, we have a longstanding commitment to DEI and taking action to foster a sustainable culture of inclusion for everyone.  DEI is a business imperative for improved performance and the innovation needed to accomplish our business goals now and in the future.  Additionally, Hess is committed to providing a global workplace free from discrimination and harassment, where everyone can achieve their full potential.  We provide equal employment opportunities for all employees and job candidates regardless of race, color, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, creed, national origin, genetic information, disability, veteran status or any other protected status.  Hess\u2019 DEI Council provides executive leadership guidance to embed DEI into our culture and drive progress throughout the organization.  Our expectations for a culture fostering mutual respect and trust are spelled out in our Code of Conduct and Ethics and related policies.  It is also reinforced regularly with employees at every level of our Corporation through regular communication and ongoing training.  Additional information about our policies and practices, including training, employee engagement initiatives and workforce data, is included in our annual Sustainability Report and annual U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity reporting, which is available on our website at www.hess.com.  During 2022, Hess maintained or improved diversity across most levels of our workforce.  Our strategic focus on DEI, including our talent practices and diversity outreach programs, contributed to this outcome.  Our DEI leader helps to develop a tailored, long-term strategy that defines our objectives and strategies to advance DEI now and in the future.  We also have six employee resource groups that provide valuable employee insights to sustain a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for everyone to thrive and perform at their best.  Additionally, workforce activity and trends such as employee turnover, promotions, DEI and development metrics, along with qualitative information such as program development and progress, are shared with our Board of Directors annually, with more detailed reviews by the Compensation and Management Development Committee throughout the year.
