BUSINESS General UDR is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, disposes of, and manages multifamily apartment communities in targeted markets located in the United States. At December\u00a031,\u00a02022, our consolidated real estate portfolio consisted of 165 communities located in 21 markets, consisting of 54,999 completed apartment homes, which are held directly or through our subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we have an ownership interest in 9,099 completed or to-be-completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships, including 6,262 apartment homes owned by entities in which we hold preferred equity investments. At December 31, 2022, the Company was developing three wholly-owned communities totaling 715 homes, of which 161 have been completed. UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as the \u201cCode.\u201d To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. In 2022, we declared total distributions of $1.52 per common share and paid dividends of $1.5025 per common share. \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dividends \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dividends \u200b \u200b Declared\u00a0in \u200b Paid\u00a0in \u200b \u200b 2022 \u200b 2022 First Quarter \u200b $  0.3800 \u200b $  0.3625 Second Quarter \u200b \u00a0  0.3800 \u200b \u00a0  0.3800 Third Quarter \u200b \u00a0  0.3800 \u200b \u00a0  0.3800 Fourth Quarter \u200b \u00a0  0.3800 \u200b \u00a0  0.3800 Total \u200b $  1.5200 \u200b $  1.5025 \u200b UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June\u00a02003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite\u00a0200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado and our telephone number is (720)\u00a0283-6120. Our website is www.udr.com.

As of December 31,\u00a02022, there were 186.1 million units in the Operating Partnership (\u201cOP Units\u201d) outstanding, of which 176.3 million OP Units (including 0.1 million of general partnership units), or 94.7%, were owned by UDR and 9.8 million OP Units, or 5.3%, were owned by outside limited partners. As of December 31,\u00a02022, there were 32.4 million units in the DownREIT Partnership (\u201cDownREIT Units\u201d) outstanding, of which 21.1 million, or 65.1%, were owned by UDR and its subsidiaries and 11.3 million, or 34.9%, were owned by outside limited partners. The consolidated financial statements of UDR include the noncontrolling interests of the unitholders in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership. Human Capital Management \u200b As of February 8, 2023, we had 1,317 full-time associates and 9 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by UDR. Of such number 916 associates are employed in roles that are located at or that are solely related to our communities and the remainder are employed in corporate roles. Recruiting and retaining our associates, as well as assisting them in their professional development, are critically important in successfully managing our business. UDR\u2019s culture is one based on innovation, inclusion, empowerment, adaptability, and execution, and understanding and maintaining our culture is fundamental to recruiting and retaining associates. To that end, in 2020 we updated our culture statement and launched an associate facing culture website to ensure that our associates understand our culture and have an opportunity to participate in its evolution. \u200b 4 4 4  Table of ContentsAssociate Compensation\u200bAttracting, developing, and retaining high-quality and diverse associates are critical to the long-term success of our Company. Implementing fair, non-biased compensation practices is our starting point. We also use various recruiting methods depending on job function, including an associate referral program, internet-based recruiting platforms, and third-party recruiting agencies. With respect to compensation, we utilize market surveys and other third-party information when determining salary ranges, and we design our compensation programs to include bonus potential to incentivize performance. In addition, we evaluate gender- and diversity-based job-title-specific compensation metrics quarterly to actively monitor pay equity, identify areas for improvement and as part of the Company\u2019s evolving long-term Environmental, Social, and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) and People Strategy. These results are provided annually to our Board of Directors.\u200bIn 2022, we implemented the CompAnalyst Enterprise solution, a compensation tool that assists us in identifying any changes in market pay and pay equity gaps, and helps us assess potential flight risks. Implementing this tool should help the Company in retaining quality associates and forecasting budgets. Results of this analysis will be incorporated into our annual communication to executive leadership and the Board of Directors.\u200bAssociate Growth and Development\u200bWe believe that training is important to our associates\u2019 job satisfaction, is essential to furthering their effectiveness, and helps in career advancement and associate retention, helping us to create a more efficient workforce. Accordingly, we offer a wide variety of training opportunities. In addition to training designed to address regulatory and statutory matters (e.g., harassment, cybersecurity, fair housing, etc.), associates have the option of participating in management development through our Certified Manager and the Level Up! Career Mobility Programs. These programs are designed to enable our associates to acquire skills that will be useful to them as they progress in their career. In total, there are over 5,000 courses available to our associates. Examples of program topics include: leasing skills, basic property maintenance, customer service, project management, and system applications. In aggregate, our associates engaged in 16,267 hours of training in 2022, or an average of 13 hours per associate. In addition, we enhanced our controls around required training to ensure that associates complete these courses in a timely manner. As of our 2022 year-end measurement, 97% of associates completed annual technology IT security training, 98% of associates completed fair housing training, 98% of associates completed annual harassment training, 98% of associates completed diversity and inclusion training, and 98% of associates completed our annual business ethics training. \u200bCertifications are important in the apartment business, and we encourage our associates to become professionally certified in areas that interest them and are beneficial to the Company. Certifications range from master\u2019s degree programs to certified property manager programs, to technical licenses for HVAC systems, all of which equip our associates with knowledge and the potential for career-expansion opportunities. UDR offers partial tuition reimbursement related to attaining these certifications.\u200bEach UDR associate is required to engage in an annual performance review with their direct supervisor. Among other things, the performance review establishes the associate\u2019s training plans for the upcoming year and provides feedback on career development for each associate.\u200bIn addition, we monitor associate turnover and take action when issues are identified if appropriate.\u200bDiversity and Inclusion\u200bWe are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace environment that supports the development and advancement of all associates.\u200bAs of December 31, 2022, our total workforce is 60% male and 40% female.

The Company\u2019s annualized declared 2022 dividend of $1.52 represented a 4.8% increase over the previous\u00a0year.Property Operations\u25cfNet income attributable to common stockholders was $82.5 million as compared to $145.8 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower gains from dispositions of real estate, higher depreciation expense due to communities acquired in 2022 and 2021, and lower investment income from unconsolidated entities primarily due to unrealized losses from SmartRent, Inc. (\u201cSmartRent\u201d), a portfolio investment of an unconsolidated fund, and lower interest income and other income/(expense) primarily due to unrealized losses from our direct investment in SmartRent, partially offset by higher total net operating income (\u201cNOI\u201d) and lower interest expense primarily due to lower debt extinguishment costs, partially offset by higher interest rates.\u25cfTotal revenues increased 17.6% over the prior year primarily due to overall market rent growth and communities acquired during 2022 and 2021.\u25cf We achieved Same-Store revenue growth of 11.1% and Same-Store NOI growth of 13.5%.Investing and Developments\u25cfWe acquired three to-be-developed parcels of land located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Riverside, California, and Dallas, Texas, for approximately $135.2 million.\u25cfWe acquired one operating community in Danvers, Massachusetts for approximately $207.5 million.\u25cfWe commenced the development of two communities located in Addison, Texas, and Tampa, Florida, with a total of 415 apartment homes.\u25cfWe recognized a gain of $25.5 million from the sale of one operating community located in Orange County, California.7 Table of Contents Table of Contents operating segments, see Note\u00a016, Reportable Segments, in the Notes\u00a0to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.Business ObjectivesOur principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value.

How demographic trends, economic drivers, and multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the long-term and our portfolio strategy generally govern our review process on where and when to allocate development capital. At December\u00a031,\u00a02022, the Company was developing three wholly-owned communities located in Washington, D.C., Addison, Texas, and Tampa, Florida, totaling 715 homes, of which 161 have been completed, with a budget of $332.5 million, in which we have an investment of $190.1 million. The communities are estimated to be completed between the first quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024. Redevelopment ActivitiesOur objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. During the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02022, we incurred $84.0 million in major renovations, which included major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. As of December\u00a031,\u00a02022, the Company\u00a0had no communities at which it was conducting substantial redevelopment activities.Joint Venture and Partnership ActivitiesWe have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i)\u00a0the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii)\u00a0our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii)\u00a0our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv)\u00a0our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.Maintaining a Strong Balance SheetWe maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. We have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate.As part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities.Consistently Driving Operational ExcellenceInvestment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our business and our residents. Our residents can conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7\u00a0days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal or, increasingly, a smart-device application.As a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents\u2019 satisfaction has improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. Web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes.10 Table of Contents Table of Contents The following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated\u00a0year-end ownership position for the past five\u00a0years (dollars in thousands):\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02021\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02020\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02018Homes acquired\u00a0\u200b 433\u00a0\u200b 5,426\u00a0\u200b 1,642\u00a0\u200b 7,079\u00a0\u200b \u2014Homes disposed\u00a0\u200b 90\u00a0\u200b 651\u00a0\u200b 599\u00a0\u200b \u2014\u00a0\u200b 868Homes owned at December\u00a031,\u00a0\u00a0\u200b 54,999\u00a0\u200b 53,229\u00a0\u200b 48,283\u00a0\u200b 47,010\u00a0\u200b 39,931Total real estate owned, at cost\u200b$ 15,570,072\u200b$ 14,740,803\u200b$ 13,071,472\u200b$ 12,602,101\u200b$ 10,196,159\u200bDevelopment ActivitiesOur objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio.

How demographic trends, economic drivers, and multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the long-term and our portfolio strategy generally govern our review process on where and when to allocate development capital. At December\u00a031,\u00a02022, the Company was developing three wholly-owned communities located in Washington, D.C., Addison, Texas, and Tampa, Florida, totaling 715 homes, of which 161 have been completed, with a budget of $332.5 million, in which we have an investment of $190.1 million. The communities are estimated to be completed between the first quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024.  Redevelopment Activities Our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. During the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02022, we incurred $84.0 million in major renovations, which included major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. As of December\u00a031,\u00a02022, the Company\u00a0had no communities at which it was conducting substantial redevelopment activities. Joint Venture and Partnership Activities We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i)\u00a0the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii)\u00a0our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii)\u00a0our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv)\u00a0our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. Maintaining a Strong Balance Sheet We maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. We have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate. As part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities. Consistently Driving Operational Excellence Investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our business and our residents. Our residents can conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7\u00a0days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal or, increasingly, a smart-device application. As a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents\u2019 satisfaction has improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient.

Some competing communities offer amenities that our communities do not have. Competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors, including sub-market supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do.We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:\u25cfa fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise;\u25cfscalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet-based marketing efforts;\u25cfaccess to sources of capital;\u25cfgeographic diversification with a presence in 21 markets across the country; and\u25cfsignificant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert.Moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with metrics that impact our bottom-line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio\u2019s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside.CommunitiesAt December\u00a031,\u00a02022, our consolidated real estate portfolio included 165 communities with a total of 54,999 completed apartment homes.

Our Same-Store Community properties provided 89.7% of our total NOI for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02022. The increase in NOI for the 47,360 Same-Store apartment homes, or 86.1% of our portfolio, was primarily driven by an increase in market rental rates, lower rent concessions, and an increase in reimbursement, ancillary and fee income, partially offset by higher repair and maintenance expense, insurance expense, utility expense, and real estate tax expense.Revenue growth in 2023 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy, inclusive of economic conditions as a result of a recession, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.Tax MattersUDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.We may utilize our taxable REIT subsidiary (\u201cTRS\u201d) to engage in activities that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Our TRS generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes.InflationInflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and repair and maintenance costs. In addition, inflation could also impact our general and administrative expenses, the interest on our debt if variable or refinanced in a high-inflationary environment, our cost of capital, and our cost of development, redevelopment, maintenance or other operating activities. However, the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an extreme or sustained escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this had a material impact on our results for the year ended December 31,\u00a02022.Environmental MattersVarious environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party.To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through professional 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents unrealized losses from SmartRent, a portfolio investment of an unconsolidated fund, and lower interest income and other income/(expense) primarily due to unrealized losses from our direct investment in SmartRent, partially offset by higher total NOI and lower interest expense.For the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02022, our Same-Store NOI increased by $111.2 million compared to the prior\u00a0year.

Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.InsuranceWe carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage on a replacement cost basis, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.Available InformationWe file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission our annual reports on Form\u00a010-K, quarterly reports on Form\u00a010-Q, and current reports on Form\u00a08-K, pursuant to Section\u00a013(a)\u00a0or 15(d)\u00a0of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties.

The following is a description of important factors that may cause the Company\u2019s actual results in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this Report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. Forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law.Risks Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Our OperationsUnfavorable Apartment Market and Economic Conditions Could Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels, Rental Revenues and the Value of Our Real Estate Assets. Unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate or unfavorable economic conditions generally, may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. Our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, debt levels, housing markets, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. Some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline. We would expect that declines in our occupancy levels and rental revenues would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities. Factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others:\u25cfdownturns in global, national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment;\u25cfdeclines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing options more affordable;\u25cfgovernment or builder incentives with respect to home ownership, making alternative housing options more attractive;\u25cflocal real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes;\u25cfdeclines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;\u25cfchanges in market rental rates;\u25cfour ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms;\u25cfthe timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations;\u25cfchanges in household formation; and\u25cfrent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating or impacting rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs or otherwise impact us.The Geographic Concentration of Our Communities in Certain Markets Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Operations if a Particular Market is Adversely Impacted by Economic or Other Conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 72.4% of our total NOI was generated from communities located in Metropolitan D.C. (14.9%), Boston, MA (11.7%), Orange County, CA (11.1%), the San Francisco Bay Area, CA (7.8%), New York, NY (7.6%), Dallas, TX (7.2%), Seattle, WA (6.7%) and Tampa, FL (5.4%). As a result, if any one or more of these markets is adversely impacted by regional or local economic conditions or real estate market conditions, such conditions may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse. In addition, if one or more of these markets is adversely affected by changes in regional or local regulations, including those related to rent control or stabilization, such regulations may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse.14 Table of Contents Table of Contents Item\u00a01A.RISK FACTORS There are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the Company, some of which are beyond its control.
