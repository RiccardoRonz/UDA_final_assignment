{"cik": 1437107, "item_1A": "ITEM\u00a01. Business. For convenience, the terms \u201cWarner Bros. Discovery\u201d, \u201cWBD\u201d, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to refer to both Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and collectively to Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. Merger with the WarnerMedia Business of AT&T On April 8, 2022 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), Discovery, Inc. (\u201cDiscovery\u201d) completed its merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with the WarnerMedia business (the \u201cWarnerMedia Business\u201d, \u201cWM Business\u201d or \u201cWM\u201d) of AT&T Inc. (\u201cAT&T\u201d) and changed its name to Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. On April 11, 2022, the Company\u2019s shares started trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) under the trading symbol WBD. The Merger was executed through a Reverse Morris Trust type transaction, under which WM was distributed to AT&T\u2019s shareholders via a pro rata distribution, and immediately thereafter, combined with Discovery. (See Note\u00a03 and Note\u00a04 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Prior to the Merger, WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc. distributed $40.5\u00a0billion to AT&T (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WM's retention of certain debt. Discovery transferred purchase consideration of $42.4\u00a0billion in equity to AT&T shareholders in the Merger. In August 2022, the Company and AT&T finalized the post-closing working capital settlement process, pursuant to section 1.3 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which resulted in the Company receiving a $1.2\u00a0billion payment from AT&T in the third quarter of 2022 in lieu of adjusting the equity issued as consideration in the Merger. AT&T shareholders received shares of WBD Series A common stock (\u201cWBD common stock\u201d) in the Merger representing 71% of the combined Company and the Company's pre-Merger shareholders continued to own 29% of the combined Company, in each case on a fully diluted basis. Discovery was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of the WM Business for accounting purposes under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d); therefore, Discovery is considered the Company\u2019s predecessor and the historical financial statements of Discovery prior to April 8, 2022, are reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Company\u2019s historical financial statements. Accordingly, the financial results of the Company as of and for any periods prior to April 8, 2022 do not include the financial results of the WM Business and current and future results will not be comparable to historical results. Description of Business  Warner Bros. Discovery is a premier global media and entertainment company that combines the WarnerMedia Business\u2019s premium entertainment, sports and news assets with Discovery\u2019s leading non-fiction and international entertainment and sports businesses, thus offering audiences a differentiated portfolio of content, brands and franchises across television, film, streaming and gaming. Some of our iconic brands and franchises include Warner Bros. Pictures Group, Warner Bros. Television Group, DC, HBO, HBO Max, Discovery Channel, discovery+, CNN, HGTV, Food Network, TNT, TBS, TLC, OWN, Warner Bros. Games, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, Game of Thrones, and The Lord of the Rings. We are home to a powerful creative engine and one of the largest collections of owned content in the world and have one of the strongest hands in the industry in terms of the completeness and quality of assets and intellectual property across sports, news, lifestyle, and entertainment in virtually every region of the globe and in most languages. Additionally, we serve audiences and consumers around the world with content that informs, entertains, and, when at its best, inspires. Our asset mix positions us to drive a balanced approach to creating long-term value for shareholders. It represents the full entertainment eco-system, and the ability to serve consumers across the entire spectrum of offerings from domestic and international networks, premium pay-TV, streaming, production and release of feature films and original series, related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming. 5 5 5   We generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our networks and digital platforms (advertising revenue); fees charged to distributors that carry our network brands and programming, including cable, direct-to-home (\u201cDTH\u201d) satellite, telecommunication and digital service providers, as well as through direct-to-consumer (\u201cDTC\u201d) subscription services (distribution revenue); the release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, the licensing of feature films and television programs to various television, subscription video on demand (\u201cSVOD\u201d) and other digital markets, distribution of feature films and television programs in the physical and digital home entertainment market, sales of console games and mobile in-game content, sublicensing of sports rights, and licensing of intellectual property such as characters and brands (content revenue); and other sources such as studio tours and production services (other revenue).  Impact of COVID-19 We continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business and geographies; however, the nature and full extent of COVID-19\u2019s effects on our operations and results are not yet known and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Certain key sources of revenue for the Studios segment, including theatrical revenues, original television productions, studio operations, and themed entertainment, have been adversely impacted by governmentally imposed shutdowns and related labor interruptions and constraints on consumer activity, particularly in the context of public entertainment venues, such as cinemas and theme parks. Segments In connection with the Merger, the Company reevaluated and changed its segment presentation during 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we classified our operations in three reportable segments:  \u2022Studios - Our Studios segment primarily consists of the production and release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, production and initial licensing of television programs to third parties and our networks/DTC services, distribution of our films and television programs to various third party and internal television and streaming services, distribution through the home entertainment market (physical and digital), related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming. \u2022Networks - Our Networks segment primarily consists of our domestic and international television networks. \u2022DTC - Our DTC segment primarily consists of our premium pay-TV and streaming services. Our segment presentation aligns with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make decisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. Financial information for our segments and the geographical areas in which we do business is set forth in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note\u00a023 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

TVN operates a portfolio of free-to-air and pay-TV lifestyle, entertainment, and news networks in Poland.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, advertising, distribution, content, and other revenues were 43%, 50%, 6%, and 1%, respectively, of total revenues for this segment. 7 7 7   DTC WBD\u2019s DTC business includes our streaming services, such as HBO Max and discovery+, and premium pay-TV services, such as HBO. Our streaming services are available on most mobile and connected TV devices. As of December 31, 2022, we had 96.1\u00a0million DTC subscribers1. HBO is one of the most respected and innovative entertainment brands in the world, serving iconic, award-winning programming through the HBO linear channels and our DTC streaming platform, HBO Max. HBO Max is a streaming platform that offers best in class quality entertainment, delivering an array of series, movies, and specials from the iconic brands of HBO, Warner Bros., and DC, as well as third-party series and blockbuster films. The platform launched in the U.S. in May 2020 and introduced a lower priced, advertising-supported tier in June 2021. Currently available in over 60 countries across the U.S., Latin America, and Europe, HBO Max began its global rollout launching in markets across Latin America and the Caribbean in the summer of 2021, followed by European launches in the Nordics, Iberia, the Netherlands and Central and Eastern Europe regions. discovery+ is WBD\u2019s non-fiction, real-life subscription streaming service. discovery+ features a wide range of exclusive, original series across popular passion verticals, including lifestyle and relationships; home and food; true crime; paranormal; adventure and natural history; science, tech, and the environment; and a slate of high-quality documentaries. HBO Max and discovery+ currently feature both ad-free and ad-lite versions. We expect to rebrand and relaunch the HBO Max product in the U.S. during the first half of 2023 with an expanded content offering, including some of the content available on discovery+. A rollout of this expanded product is expected to follow in Latin America later in the year. European markets are planned to follow in 2024, with additional launches in key Asia-Pacific territories and some new European markets anticipated later in 2024. We expect to have both an ad-lite and an ad-free version of the expanded product in many markets. The company also intends to continue offering the standalone discovery+ service in the U.S. and international markets.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, advertising, distribution, and content revenues are 5%, 88%, and 7%, respectively, of total revenues for this segment. COMPETITION Providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide. We experience competition for the development and acquisition of content, distribution of our content, sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership. There is competition from other production studios, other television networks, and online-based content providers for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers, producers and directors. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content, attracting viewers and the sale of advertising. Our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience, the distribution of our content, viewership, and the production, marketing and advertising support we provide. Our networks compete with other television networks, including broadcast, cable and local, for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators, DTH satellite service providers, and other distributors that carry our content. Our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences. Our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Growth in the number of networks distributed, consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry, and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place. The ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production, acquisition and packaging of original content, viewership, the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors, the product offering across a series of networks within a region, and the prices charged for carriage.  1 We define a \u201cDTC Subscription\u201d as:  (i) a retail subscription to discovery+, HBO or HBO Max for which we have recognized subscription revenue, whether directly or through a third party, from a direct-to-consumer platform; (ii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, or HBO Max for which we have recognized subscription revenue from a fixed-fee arrangement with a third party and where the individual user has activated their subscription; (iii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO or HBO Max for which we have recognized subscription revenue on a per subscriber basis; and (iv) users on free trials who convert to a subscription for which we have recognized subscription revenue within the first seven days of the calendar month immediately following the month in which their free trial expires. We may refer to the aggregate number of DTC Subscriptions as \u201csubscribers.\u201d The reported number of \u201csubscribers\u201d included herein and the definition of \u201cDTC Subscription\u201d as used herein excludes: (i) individuals who subscribe to DTC products, other than discovery+, HBO and HBO Max, that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture partners or affiliated parties from time to time; (ii) a limited number of international discovery+ subscribers that are part of non-strategic partnerships or short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) domestic and international Cinemax subscribers, and international basic HBO subscribers; and (iv) users on free trials except for those users on free trial that convert to a DTC Subscription within the first seven days of the next month as noted above.  8 8 8   Our networks and streaming services, which include HBO Max and discovery+ compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks, including broadcast, cable, local networks, and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising. Our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network, the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content, the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by third-party research companies, prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace. Our networks and streaming services also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers, including broadcast, cable and local networks, streaming services, pay-per-view and VOD services, online activities and other forms of news, information and media entertainment. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We are one of the world\u2019s leading creators, owners and distributors of intellectual property. Our intellectual property assets include copyrights in films, television programs, software, comic books and mobile apps; trademarks in names, logos and characters; patents or patent applications for inventions related to products and services; websites; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds from third parties. We have made and will continue to make investments in developing technology platforms to support our digital products and DTC offerings, including HBO Max and discovery+, and consider these platforms to be intellectual property assets as well.  We are a global media and entertainment company and the protection of our content and brands is of primary importance. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, unfair competition, and internet/domain name statutes and laws, and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories, and new legislative or regulatory initiatives could impact our operations.  We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not be effective. Piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signals, and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property. Piracy also includes the unauthorized use of our intellectual property on physical goods. We have a team dedicated to disrupting and curbing piracy and other forms of intellectual property infringement and use external vendors to detect and remove infringements. We also engage with intermediaries that facilitate piracy, leverage our membership in a range of industry groups, and initiate enforcement actions, including litigation, to address piracy issues. In general, policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly.  Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may also result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations.  REGULATORY MATTERS Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies, such as the E.U., in which we operate. Content networks, such as those owned by us, are regulated in certain limited respects by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), including some regulations that only apply to content networks affiliated with a cable television operator. Other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite (\u201cDBS\u201d) operators and other distributors, affect content networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change. These descriptions are summary in nature and describe only the most significant regulations we face; they do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses. Program Access The Communications Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) and the FCC\u2019s program access rules prevent a satellite-delivered content vendor in which a cable operator has an \u201cattributable\u201d ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d), such as cable and DBS operators, in the rates, terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content networks, on the basis of the non-affiliation. These rules permit the unaffiliated MVPD to initiate a complaint to the FCC against content networks if it believes this rule has been violated. 9 9 9   Program Carriage The Act and the FCC\u2019s program carriage rules prohibit distributors from favoring their affiliated content networks over unaffiliated, similarly situated content networks in the rates, terms and conditions of carriage agreements between content networks and cable operators or other MVPDs. Recent regulatory changes and court decisions make it more difficult for us to challenge a distributor\u2019s decision to decline to carry one of our content networks or discriminate against one of our content networks. \u201cMust-Carry\u201d/Retransmission Consent The Act imposes \u201cmust-carry\u201d regulations on cable systems, requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market if they elect mandatory carriage. DBS systems are also subject to their own must-carry rules. The FCC\u2019s implementation of \u201cmust-carry\u201d obligations requires cable operators and DBS providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space and favorable channel positions. This reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our content networks by cable and DBS operators. The Act also gives broadcasters the choice of opting out of must-carry and invoking the right to retransmission consent, which refers to a broadcaster\u2019s right to require MVPDs, such as cable and satellite operators, to obtain the broadcaster\u2019s consent before distributing the broadcaster\u2019s signal to the MVPDs\u2019 subscribers, often at a substantial cost that reduces the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters, such as us. Accessibility, Children\u2019s Advertising Restrictions, Emergency Alerts and CALM Act Certain of our content networks and some of our IP-delivered video content must provide closed-captioning and audio description of some of their programming and comply with other regulations designed to make our content more accessible to persons with disabilities. The U.S. Congress, the FCC, and the U.S. Department of Justice periodically consider proposals to implement additional accessibility requirements, some of which would increase our obligations substantially. Our content networks intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on the amount and type of permissible advertising, and certain regulations extend to our digital products when they are referenced by web address in our content networks. We may not include emergency alert tones or signals in our content. Commercials embedded in our networks\u2019 television content stream also must adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material. Obscenity Restrictions Network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content, and our distribution agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks. Regulation of Digital Services We operate a variety of free, advertising-based and subscription-based digital products and streaming services providing information and entertainment to consumers in the U.S. and international markets via web, mobile and connected TV platforms. In some cases, those products and services are provided directly to consumers, and in other cases, they can be used and/or purchased through a third-party distributor, such as Xfinity or Hulu. Our digital products and services are subject to federal and state regulation in the U.S. relating to the privacy and security of personal information collected from our users, including laws pertaining to the acquisition of personal information from children under 16. Some examples of these laws include the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). Many additional U.S. state and federal regulations impose data security and data breach obligations on the Company. These laws and their public and private enforcement are continually evolving, with several comprehensive U.S. state privacy laws effective in 2023, many more introduced and expected to pass in the coming year, and novel litigation theories related to privacy advancing in the courts. Additional federal and state laws and regulations apply or may be adopted with respect to our digital products and services, covering such issues as data privacy and security, child safety, oversight of user-generated content, advertising, competition, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. The scope of regulation may differ depending on how these products and services are used and/or purchased. In addition, the FCC from time to time considers whether some or all digital services should be considered MVPDs and regulated as such. 10 10 10   Intellectual Property Laws and Regulations Our intellectual property assets are discussed under \u201cBusiness \u2013 Intellectual Property\u201d above. Our content, whether distributed over broadcast, cable, DBS, wireless, or internet-based services, or through other means, is protected under intellectual property law, including copyright, trademark, patent, unfair competition, and internet/domain name statutes and laws and license agreements. Changes to these laws and regulations could either strengthen or weaken our ability to license and protect our content and combat its theft or misuse. Foreign Laws and Regulations The foreign jurisdictions in which our products and services are offered have, in varying degrees, laws and regulations governing our businesses, including relating to the production, monetization and distribution of content. By way of example, our digital offerings available to consumers in international jurisdictions are subject to laws and regulations relating to, without limitation, consumer protection, data privacy and security, advertising, competition, intellectual property, and content limitations. Similar to the U.S., new laws and regulations in international jurisdictions may be adopted with respect to our intellectual property, products and services. In particular, we face increased efforts in international jurisdictions to regulate streaming services, which may constrain our offerings. Further, international laws and regulations around intellectual property could limit our ability to license and protect our content, as well as impose additional burdens on our business. HUMAN CAPITAL  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 37,500 employees, including full-time and part-time employees of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures. Our employees are located in 54 different countries, with 56% located in the U.S. and 44% located outside of the U.S. We are a talent-driven business, aiming to attract, develop, and motivate top talent throughout our company. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to provide competitive, locally-relevant benefits, performance-based pay, and nonfinancial support and incentives. We also strive to enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making our workplace diverse, engaging and inclusive, and to develop our talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future. We also provide opportunities for our employees to make an impact in their communities through social good initiatives around the world.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (\u201cDE&I\u201d)  Our DE&I objective is to seek out diversity, remove barriers, and create space for all to share ideas and be heard. DE&I at WBD is overseen by our Chief Global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Officer. We implement our DE&I initiatives and pipeline programs through global, regional and corporate councils that partner with internal and external stakeholders across our brands, business units and regions. We have also established a Creative Diversity Council to address DE&I in our content production businesses. We seek to support our employees through the sponsorship of 16 Business Resource Groups (\u201cBRGs\u201d) globally, comprised of over 40 chapters. BRGs are intended to enable employees with shared pursuits, purpose, identities, and interests to lead, contribute and build community for all. Learning and Development Our Global Learning & Development (\u201cL&D\u201d) team provides learning opportunities for employees around the world.
