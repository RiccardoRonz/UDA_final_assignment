{"cik": 915912, "item_1A": "ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS  General  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the \u201cCompany,\u201d which term, unless the context otherwise requires, refers to AvalonBay Communities, Inc. together with its subsidiaries), is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes. We develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily apartment communities in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California, as well as in our expansion markets of Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte, North Carolina, Southeast Florida, Dallas and Austin, Texas, and Denver, Colorado. We focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe historically have been characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life. We believe these market characteristics have offered, and will continue in the future to offer, the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns over the long-term on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics.   At January\u00a031, 2023, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in:  \u2022275 operating apartment communities containing 82,411 apartment homes in 12 states and the District of Columbia, of which 267 communities containing 80,164 apartment homes were consolidated for financial reporting purposes and eight communities containing 2,247 apartment homes were held by unconsolidated entities in which we hold an ownership interest.  \u202218 wholly-owned development apartment communities that are expected to contain an aggregate of 5,589 apartment homes when completed and one unconsolidated investment which holds an apartment community under development and is expected to contain 475 apartment homes when completed.  \u2022Rights to develop an additional 39 communities that, if developed as expected, will contain 13,312 apartment homes.  We generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we raze, or by acquiring an existing community. In selecting sites for development or acquisition, we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation, recreation areas, entertainment, shopping and dining.  Our principal financial goal is to increase long-term shareholder value through the development, redevelopment, acquisition, ownership and, when appropriate, disposition of apartment communities in our markets. To help meet this goal, we regularly (i)\u00a0monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type, (ii)\u00a0develop, redevelop and acquire interests in apartment communities in our selected markets, (iii)\u00a0selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our long-term strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and (iv)\u00a0maintain a capital structure that we believe is aligned with our business risks and allows us to maintain continuous access to cost-effective capital. We also seek to generate additional shareholder value from investments in other real estate-related ventures, including through the Structured Investment Program (\"SIP\"), our platform to provide mezzanine loans or preferred equity to third-party multifamily developers. We undertake our development and redevelopment activities primarily through in-house development and redevelopment teams, and buy and dispose of assets through our in-house investments platform. We believe that our organizational structure, which includes dedicated development and operational teams, and strong culture are key differentiators. We pursue our development, redevelopment, investment and operating activities with the purpose of \"Creating a Better Way to Live.\" 1 1 1 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select U.S. markets, providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value. We pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets, leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management. We operate our apartment communities under four core brands:   \u2022Avalon, our core \u201cAvalon\u201d brand, focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services;  \u2022AVA targets customers in high energy, transit-served neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments, many of which are designed for roommate living, and a variety of active common spaces that encourage socialization;  \u2022eaves by Avalon is targeted to the cost conscious, \u201cvalue\u201d segment primarily in suburban areas; and  \u2022Kanso, which we introduced in 2020, is designed to create an apartment living experience that offers simplicity without sacrifice at a more moderate price point, featuring high-quality apartment homes, limited-to-no community amenities and a low-touch, largely self-service operating model that leverages technology and smart access.   We believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint.  During the three years ended December 31, 2022, we:   \u2022acquired 11 apartment communities, excluding unconsolidated investments;   \u2022disposed of 27 apartment communities, excluding unconsolidated investments;  \u2022realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of six communities owned by unconsolidated real estate entities; and  \u2022completed the development of 23 apartment communities, including unconsolidated investments, and the redevelopment of one apartment community.  A more detailed description of our unconsolidated real estate entities and the related investment activity can be found in Note\u00a05, \u201cInvestments,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item\u00a08 of this report and in Item\u00a07. \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d  A further discussion of our development, redevelopment, disposition, acquisition, property management and related strategies follows.  Development Strategy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. As one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets, we maintain regional offices to identify and support development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information. In addition to our principal executive office in Arlington, Virginia, we also have regional offices, administrative offices or specialty offices, including offices that are in or near the following cities:  \u2022Bellevue, Washington; \u2022Boston, Massachusetts; \u2022Chapel Hill, North Carolina; \u2022Denver, Colorado; \u2022Fort Lauderdale, Florida; \u2022Irvine, California; \u2022Los Angeles, California; \u2022Melville, New York; \u2022New York, New York; \u2022San Francisco, California; \u2022San Jose, California; \u2022Shelton, Connecticut; \u2022Virginia Beach, Virginia; and \u2022Westfield, New Jersey.  2  2  2  Table of Contents Table of Contents After selecting a site for development, we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a long-term conditional contract. Options and long-term conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire an interest in the site after the completion of entitlements and shortly before the start of construction, which reduces development-related risks and preserves capital. However, as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development, we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained. When acquiring improved land with existing commercial uses prior to development, any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations, which we consider to be incidental, is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income. Any expenses relating to these operations, in excess of any rents received, are recognized in net income. In addition, we have previously identified, and may again in the future identify, opportunities to increase value by expanding the density of certain existing operating communities. We have also participated, and may in the future participate, in master planned or other large multi-use developments where we commit to build infrastructure (such as roads) to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties (such as unimproved ground floor commercial space, municipal garages or parks). Costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services. Particularly with large scale, urban in-fill developments, we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction. For further discussion of our Development Rights, refer to Item\u00a02. \u201cProperties\u201d in this report.  We generally act as our own development manager, general contractor and construction manager directly (although we may use a wholly-owned subsidiary), and will elect to use a third-party developer or general contractor where we believe it is beneficial to do so, such as in our expansion markets where we have limited experience. We believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality, greater control over construction schedules and cost savings. Our development, property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase.  Throughout this report, the term \u201cdevelopment\u201d is used to refer to the entire property development cycle, including pursuit of zoning approvals, procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process. References to \u201cconstruction\u201d refer to the actual construction of the property, which is only one element of the development cycle.  Redevelopment Strategy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we undertake the redevelopment of a community, our goal is to renovate and/or rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital. In addition to large scale redevelopment where a community is classified as a redevelopment, we undertake smaller scale redevelopment activities related to the apartment interiors to enhance the resident experience at our operating communities. We have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment. Our redevelopment teams, which include redevelopment, construction and property management personnel, monitor redevelopment progress.   Throughout this report, the term \u201credevelopment\u201d is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle, including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs, budgeting and actual renovation work. The actual renovation work is referred to as \u201creconstruction,\u201d which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle.  Disposition Strategy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We sell assets that no longer meet our long-term strategy or when real estate market conditions are favorable, and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions. This also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity by redeploying the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally. When we decide to sell a community, we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other terms of each proposal.  As part of the Archstone Acquisition in 2013 (as defined in Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on February 22, 2019), we acquired, and still own, 14 assets that had previously been contributed by third parties on a tax-deferred basis to an Archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests. To protect the tax-deferred nature of the contribution, the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling, or failing to maintain sufficient levels of secured financing on, the contributed assets.\u00a0Our tax protection payment obligations with respect to these assets expire at different times and in some cases don\u2019t expire until the death of a third party who contributed ownership interests to the Archstone partnership. After review and investigation of Archstone\u2019s tax and accounting records, we estimate that, had we sold or taken other triggering actions in 2022 with respect to all 14 assets, the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would have been triggered would have been approximately $44,900,000.\u00a0At the present time, we do not intend to take actions that would cause us to be required to make tax protection payments with respect to any of these assets.  3  3  3  Table of Contents Table of Contents Acquisition Strategy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target. Acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence. Acquisitions (and dispositions) also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio. While we are primarily focused on acquisitions in our expansion markets of Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte, North Carolina, Southeast Florida, Dallas and Austin, Texas, and Denver, Colorado, we may pursue additional investments in our established regions based on market conditions.  Property Management Strategy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We seek to increase operating income through innovative, proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses. Our principal strategies to maximize operating income include:  \u2022focusing on associate engagement and resident satisfaction; \u2022staggering lease terms such that lease expirations are matched with seasonal demand; \u2022delivering high occupancy with premium pricing for various customer segments; and \u2022making innovations in our operating model through (i) leveraging technology, including digital smart access and various automation technologies and (ii) data science to optimize revenue from the portfolio, while reducing customer acquisition, transaction and retention costs.  Constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth. Growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue, thereby increasing operating margins. We constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways, which include, but are not limited to, the following:  \u2022purchase order controls, including acquiring goods and services from pre-approved vendors; \u2022national negotiated contracts and bulk purchases where possible; \u2022bidding third-party contracts on a volume basis; \u2022retaining residents through high levels of service, which reduces apartment turnover costs, marketing and vacant apartment utility costs; \u2022performing turnover work in-house or hiring third parties, generally considering the most cost effective approach as well as expertise needed to perform the work; \u2022regular preventive maintenance to maximize resident safety and satisfaction and property and equipment life;  \u2022centralization of many community administration and support tasks at our shared service center; \u2022pursuing real estate tax appeals;  \u2022installing high efficiency lighting and water fixtures, cogeneration systems and solar panels; and \u2022implementing technology for resident and prospect services such as package lockers and self guided or virtual tours.  On-site property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the revenue, expense, Net Operating Income (\u201cNOI\u201d), prospect conversion, resident retention and customer service metrics produced at their respective communities. We use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities, believing that technology applications can improve the delivery and efficiency of our services and aid in the accurate collection of financial and resident data, which will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions, maintenance decisions and financial management.  We generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly (although we may use a wholly-owned subsidiary) both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner. From time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing and/or maintenance activity at one or more of our communities where we have limited historical experience such as our expansion markets or for other reasons.  From time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction. We provide such non-customary services to residents or share in the revenue or income from such services through a taxable REIT subsidiary (\"TRS\"), which is a subsidiary that is treated as a \u201cC corporation\u201d subject to federal income taxes. See \u201cTax Matters\u201d below.  Financing Strategy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our financing strategy is to maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to help ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks. We estimate that our short-term liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand, borrowings under our $2,250,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) and our $500,000,000 unsecured commercial paper note program (the \"Commercial Paper Program\"), sales of current operating communities and/or issuance of additional debt or equity securities, including amounts through the planned settlement of the outstanding forward contracts to sell 2,000,000 shares of common stock by no later than  4  4  4  Table of Contents Table of Contents December 31, 2023. A determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions, our short and long-term liquidity needs, the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities. A summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item\u00a08 of this report.  We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would develop and/or own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i)\u00a0the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community; (ii)\u00a0our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii)\u00a0our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv)\u00a0our projection, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.  In addition, from time to time, we may offer shares of our equity securities, debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property. We may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own.  Other Strategies and Activities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities, we have the ability to invest in other activities and to make non-equity investments, including the following:  \u2022Commercial space: we develop, own and lease commercial space at our communities when either (i)\u00a0the highest and best use of the space is for commercial (e.g.,\u00a0street level in an urban area); (ii)\u00a0we believe the commercial space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents; or (iii)\u00a0some component of commercial space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had a total of approximately 926,000 square feet of rentable commercial space, excluding commercial space within communities currently under development. Gross rental revenue provided by leased commercial space in 2022 was $42,971,000 (1.7% of total revenue).  \u2022For-sale real estate development: we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the commercial or for-sale residential components of a mixed-use building or project that we help develop. We may from time to time, through a TRS, develop real estate and hold it for sale upon completion if we believe that this will be the best use or disposition opportunity for the property, as is the case with our sale of apartment condominium units at The Park Loggia condominium development in New York, NY.  \u2022Structured Investment Program: while we generally invest in multifamily real estate through fee simple ownership or an equity investment in a joint venture, we established a new investment platform through which we provide mezzanine loans or preferred equity to third-party multifamily developers. At December\u00a031, 2022, we had commitments for three mezzanine loans of up to $92,375,000 in the aggregate. The mezzanine loans have a weighted average rate of return of 9.8% and mature at various dates on or before June 2026. At December\u00a031, 2022, we have funded $29,352,000 of these commitments.  \u2022Property technology and environmentally focused companies and investment management funds: we have also invested, either through a wholly-owned TRS, or in an investment vehicle that has elected to be treated as a TRS, in companies (and in venture funds that invest in companies) that provide technology services to the real estate industry, and we have invested, through a TRS, in environmentally focused companies and investment management funds to further our sustainability efforts and learning. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had invested $36,178,000 in various property technology and environmentally focused companies directly and indirectly through investment management funds. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we have $34,299,000 of outstanding equity commitments to these investment management funds, with the timing and amount for these commitments to be fulfilled dependent on if, and when, investment opportunities are identified by their respective funds.  We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so. At all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT unless, because of circumstances or changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) (or the Treasury Regulations thereunder), our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a REIT.  5  5  5  Table of Contents Table of Contents We conduct many of the administrative functions associated with our property operations (including billing, collections, and response to resident inquiries) through an internally operated shared services center, rather than having on-site associates conduct such activities.\u00a0We believe this centralized platform allows our on-site associates to focus more on current and prospective resident services, while at the same time enabling us to reduce costs, mitigate risk and increase our availability and responsiveness to our residents.\u00a0We are exploring the possibility of performing these shared service center administrative functions for a third party as a means of creating an additional revenue stream and economies of scale at our center. We cannot assure that we will provide such services to a third party or that it will be successful if we do so.\u00a0  Tax Matters  We filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a REIT under the Code and intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a REIT, with limited exceptions, such as those described under \u201cProperty Management Strategy\u201d above, we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent such taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders. We expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level. While we believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.  Competition  We face competition from other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, REITs both in the multifamily as well as other sectors, and other well capitalized investors, to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development. As an owner and operator of apartment communities, we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose pricing may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location, terms and amenities that the prospective resident seeks. We also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent, including those offered through online platforms. Although we often compete against large, sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents, real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents.  Regulatory Matters  Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and related laws and regulations.  Environmental Regulations. As a current or prior owner, operator and developer of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities. For some Development Communities, we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction, which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost. Environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction.  Regulations Relating to the Construction, Operation and Leasing of Our Communities. The construction, operation and leasing of our communities is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, include zoning laws, building codes, requirements that our communities be accessible to persons with disabilities, fair housing laws, and, depending on the jurisdiction, regulations regarding the charging of rents and fees and increases in such amounts upon renewal of leases. Some laws relating to the setting of rents apply broadly, such as in California, where residential rent increases at renewal in communities older than fifteen years are limited to the lesser of 10% or 5% plus local consumer price index (CPI), and in New York, where laws regulate increases on those units that are subject to rent-control or rent-stabilization. In California, the Governor and local governments have the ability to enact (and have in recent years exercised such right, for example, in connection with wildfires) local or statewide states of emergency which limit our ability to increase new and renewal rents to no more than 10% over the rent in place on the date such state of emergency was declared, which has impacted some of our California communities. In addition, various temporary federal, state and local laws enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic have imposed additional  6  6  6  Table of Contents Table of Contents regulations of or limitations on our ability to evict tenants who are delinquent in payment of their rent, charge late fees, or raise rents more than a regulated amount upon renewal. We have seen an increase in state and local governments in our markets implementing, considering or being urged by various constituencies to consider new or modified rent control regulations, rent stabilization, or other laws that may limit or delay our ability to charge market rents, increase rents, charge ancillary fees or evict tenants.  See Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations.  Human Capital   Attracting, motivating, developing, and retaining talented associates is important to our long-term success. We engage with our associates to understand our purpose, \"Creating a Better Way to Live,\" our core values (a commitment to integrity, a spirit of caring and a focus on continuous improvement) and our cultural norms (we collaborate, excel, innovate, act like owners, are thoughtful and thorough, and show appreciation).  At January\u00a031, 2023, we had 2,947 employees, of which approximately 97% were employed on a full-time basis. Approximately 66% of our associates work on-site at our operating communities and the balance work on other matters. None of our associates are represented by a union except for approximately 13 maintenance associates at communities in Westchester County, New York, where we are in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement.  We consider the following aspects of human capital management to be important:  Diversity and Inclusion. We value workforce diversity and an inclusive culture. We believe that a diverse workplace will produce a variety of perspectives, motivate associates and help us understand and better serve our customers and the communities in which we do business. At January\u00a031, 2023, 37% of our associates self-identified as White, 30% as Hispanic, 15% as Black, 7% as Asian, and 11% as other ethnicities, two or more ethnicities or did not respond. At January\u00a031, 2023, 60% of our associates self-identified as male and 40% as female. We are committed to promoting and achieving greater workplace diversity and have undertaken active steps to further this goal, including by supporting associate resource groups.  Associate Engagement. We monitor the engagement of our associates, receive feedback from our associates, and benchmark our performance by having a third party firm conduct anonymous associate perspective surveys each year. The results are discussed and presented both on a company-wide basis and within each functional group.  Safety. We take workplace safety seriously at our construction sites, our operating communities and our offices. Through our Construction Site Safety Observation program and our dedicated safety team, we monitor project-level safety performance metrics at our construction sites, and elements of compensation for our construction group and our CEO are based on safety compliance performance. Our maintenance associates are required to take monthly safety training on a variety of subjects, and our risk management group monitors incident reports from our offices and communities.  Training. To help our associates develop the skills they need to advance in their careers and succeed at AvalonBay, we train them in a variety of ways, including online, instructor-led and on-the-job learning. Our learning management system, AvalonBay University, offers approximately 600 courses providing functional, technical, management, ethics, compliance and cyber-awareness training.  7  7  7  Table of Contents Table of Contents Other Information  We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

Supplemental U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations  The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under \u201cCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment\u201d in the prospectus dated February 25, 2021, contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021, as supplemented by the discussion under the heading \u201cSupplemental U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022. Capitalized terms herein that are not otherwise defined shall have the same meaning as when used in such disclosures (as supplemented).  On December 29, 2022, the Internal Revenue Service promulgated final Treasury Regulations under Sections 897, 1441, 1445, and 1446 of the Code that were, in part, intended to coordinate various withholding regimes for non-U.S. stockholders. The new Treasury Regulations provide that:   i.The withholding rules applicable to ordinary REIT dividends paid to a non-U.S. stockholder (generally, a 30% rate of withholding on gross amounts unless otherwise reduced by treaty or effectively connected with such non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s trade or business within the U.S. and proper certifications are provided) apply to (a) that portion of any distribution paid by us that is not designated as a capital gain dividend, a return of basis or a distribution in excess of the non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s adjusted basis in its stock that is treated as gain from the disposition of such stock and (b) any portion of a capital gain dividend paid by us that is not treated as gain attributable to the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest by reason of the recipient not owning more than 10% of a class of our stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market during the one-year period ending on the date of the capital gain dividend.  ii.The withholding rules under FIRPTA apply to a distribution paid by us in excess of a non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s adjusted basis in our stock, unless the interest in our stock is not a U.S. real property interest (for example, because we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity) or the distribution is paid to a \u201cwithholding qualified holder.\u201d A \u201cwithholding qualified holder\u201d means a qualified holder (as defined below) and a foreign partnership all of the interests of which are held by qualified holders, including through one or more partnerships.  iii.The withholding rules under FIRPTA apply to any portion of a capital gain dividend paid by us to a non-U.S. stockholder that is attributable to the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest, unless it is paid to a withholding qualified holder.  In the case of FIRPTA withholding under clause (ii) above, the applicable withholding rate is currently 15%, and in the case of FIRPTA withholding under clause (iii) above the withholding rate is currently 21%. For purposes of FIRPTA withholding under clause (iii), whether a capital gain dividend is attributable to the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest is determined taking into account the general exception from FIRPTA distribution treatment for distributions paid to certain non-U.S. stockholders under which any distribution by us to a non-U.S. stockholder with respect to any class of stock which is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States is not treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest if such non-U.S. stockholder did not own more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of such distribution. To the extent inconsistent, these Treasury Regulations supersede the discussion on withholding contained in the above-referenced disclosures (as supplemented) under the heading \u201c-U.S. Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders.\u201d However, if, notwithstanding these Treasury Regulations, we encounter difficulties  8  8  8  Table of Contents Table of Contents in properly characterizing a distribution for purposes of the withholding rules, we may decide to withhold on such distribution at the highest possible U.S. federal withholding rate that we determine could apply.  Additionally, the second paragraph under the heading \u201c-U.S. Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders-Distributions by Avalon Bay\u201d is hereby deleted and replaced with the following:  Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (not attributable to gains from disposition of U.S. real property interests) that exceed the non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s basis in its common stock will be taxable to a non-U.S. stockholder as gain from the sale of its common stock, which is discussed below. Distributions in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits and not attributable to gains from our sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests will not be taxable to a non-U.S. stockholder to the extent they do not exceed the adjusted basis of the non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s shares (determined separately for each share). Instead, they will reduce adjusted basis of such shares. To the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted basis of a non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s shares, they will be treated as gain from the sale or disposition of the non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s shares and may be subject to tax as described in the \u201c- Sale of Common Stock\u201d portion of this section below.   The new Treasury Regulations also provide new guidance regarding qualified foreign pension funds. Accordingly, the first paragraph under the heading \u201c-U.S. Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders-Qualified Foreign Pension Funds\u201d is hereby deleted and replaced with the following:  In general, for FIRPTA purposes, and subject to the discussion below regarding \u201cqualified holders,\u201d neither a \u201cqualified foreign pension fund\u201d (as defined below) nor any entity all of the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund is treated as a foreign person, thereby exempting such entities from tax under FIRPTA. A \u201cqualified foreign pension fund\u201d is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established by a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions thereof) or one or more employers to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees or, in consideration for, services rendered, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise available, to relevant local tax authorities, and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate. Under Treasury Regulations, subject to the discussion below regarding \u201cqualified holders,\u201d a \u201cqualified controlled entity\u201d also is not generally treated as a foreign person for purposes of FIRPTA. A qualified controlled entity generally includes a trust or corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country all of the interests of which are held by one or more qualified foreign pension funds either directly or indirectly through one or more qualified controlled entities.   Treasury Regulations further require that a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity will not be exempt from FIRPTA with respect to dispositions of U.S. real property interests or REIT distributions attributable to the same unless the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is a \u201cqualified holder.\u201d To be a qualified holder, a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity must satisfy one of two alternative tests at the time of the disposition of the U.S. real property interest or the REIT distribution. Under the first test, a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder if it owned no U.S. real property interests as of the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition or distribution during which it qualified as a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity. Alternatively, if a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity held U.S. real property interests as of the earliest date during the period described in the preceding sentence, it can be a qualified holder only if it satisfies certain testing period requirements.  Treasury Regulations also provide that a foreign partnership all of the interests of which are held by qualified holders, including through one or more partnerships, may certify its status as such and will not be treated as a foreign person for purposes of withholding under Code Section 1445 (and Code Section 1446, as applicable).  9  9  9   Table of Contents Table of Contents", "time": "00:00:07"}
