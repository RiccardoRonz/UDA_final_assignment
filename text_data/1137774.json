(\u201cPrudential Financial\u201d or \u201cPFI\u201d), a global financial services leader and premier active global investment manager with approximately $1.377 trillion of assets under management as of December\u00a031, 2022, has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates we offer a wide array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related products and services, mutual funds and investment management. We offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through proprietary and third-party distribution networks. Our principal executive offices are located in Newark, New Jersey, and Prudential Financial\u2019s Common Stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cPRU\u201d. \u00a0 On December 18, 2001, The Prudential Insurance Company of America (\u201cPICA\u201d) converted from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. The demutualization was carried out under PICA\u2019s Plan of Reorganization, which required us to establish and operate a regulatory mechanism known as the \u201cClosed Block\u201d. The Closed Block includes certain in-force participating insurance and annuity products and corresponding assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholders\u2019 dividends on these products, as well as certain related assets and liabilities.  In October 2021, the Company announced the creation of Retirement Strategies, a new U.S. business that would serve the retirement needs of both its institutional and individual customers by bringing the institutional investment and pension solutions offered through the Retirement business together with the financial solutions and capabilities of the Individual Annuities business. Commencing with the second quarter of 2022, this new structure has been fully operationalized; therefore, the results of the former Retirement segment (now known as the \u201cInstitutional Retirement Strategies\u201d operating segment) and the former Individual Annuities segment (now known as the \u201cIndividual Retirement Strategies\u201d operating segment) have been aggregated into the Retirement Strategies segment. Prior periods have been updated to conform to this new presentation.  Our principal operations consist of PGIM (our global investment management business), our U.S. Businesses (consisting of our Retirement Strategies, Group Insurance, Individual Life and Assurance IQ businesses), our International Businesses, the Closed Block division and our Corporate and Other operations. The Closed Block division is accounted for as a divested business that is reported separately from the Divested and Run-off Businesses that are included in Corporate and Other. Divested and Run-off Businesses are composed of businesses that have been, or will be, sold or exited, including businesses that have been placed in wind-down status that do not qualify for \u201cdiscontinued operations\u201d accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). Our Corporate and Other operations include corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments as well as the Divested and Run-off Businesses described above. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets by segment.  Our strategy centers on our mix of high-quality protection, retirement and investment management businesses which creates growth potential due to earnings diversification and the opportunity to provide customers with integrated cross-business solutions, as well as capital benefits from a balanced risk profile. We are well-positioned to meet the needs of customers and tap into significant market opportunities through PGIM, our U.S. Businesses and our International Businesses.

We exclude these results from our adjusted operating income. Divested and Run-off Businesses include:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022Long-Term Care\u2014In 2012, we discontinued sales of our individual and group long-term care insurance products. We establish reserves for these products in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition date when establishing reserves for future policyholder benefits and expenses, including assumptions for morbidity, mortality, mortality improvement, persistency, expenses and investment returns. Our assumptions also include our estimate of the timing and amount of anticipated future premium rate increases and policyholder benefit reductions, including those which may require approval by state regulatory authorities.  \u2022Full Service Retirement Business\u2014In the third quarter of 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Full Service Retirement business. The results of this business and the impact of its anticipated sale were transferred from the Retirement segment to Divested and Run-off Businesses at that time. The sale was completed in the second quarter of 2022.  \u2022The Prudential Life Insurance Company of Taiwan Inc.\u2014In the third quarter of 2020, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to sell our insurance business in Taiwan. The results of this business and the impact of its anticipated sale were transferred from the International Businesses segment to Divested and Run-off Businesses at that time. The sale was completed in the second quarter of 2021.   \u2022The Prudential Life Insurance Company of Korea, Ltd.\u2014In the second quarter of 2020, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to sell our insurance business in Korea. The results of this business and the impact of its anticipated sale were transferred from the International Businesses segment to Divested and Run-off Businesses at that time. The sale was completed in the third quarter of 2020.   \u00a0 15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents   Closed Block Division \u00a0 In connection with the demutualization in 2001, we ceased offering domestic participating individual life insurance and annuity products under which policyholders are eligible to receive policyholder dividends reflecting experience. The liabilities for our individual in-force participating products were segregated, together with assets to be used exclusively for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends, expenses and taxes with respect to these products, in the Closed Block. We selected the amount of assets that were expected to generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the Closed Block policies, over the life of the Closed Block to fund payments of all policyholder benefits, expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of the policyholder dividend scales that were in effect in 2000, assuming experience underlying such scales continued. No policies sold after demutualization have been added to the Closed Block, and its in-force business is expected to decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full.  The results of the Closed Block, along with certain related assets and liabilities, comprise the Closed Block division, which is treated as a divested business under our definition of adjusted operating income and reported separately from the other Divested and Run-off Businesses that are included in our Corporate and Other operations.  \u00a0 As discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if the performance of the Closed Block is more or less favorable than we originally assumed in funding, total dividends paid to Closed Block policyholders in the future may be greater or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales that were in effect in 2000 had been continued. A policyholder dividend obligation liability is established for any excess experience, which may be available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders as part of policyholder dividends, unless offset by future Closed Block experience that is less favorable than expected. This excess experience will not be available to shareholders. If the Closed Block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from PICA\u2019s assets outside of the Closed Block. Each year, the Board of Directors of PICA determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the Closed Block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses, mortality experience and other factors. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets of the Closed Block division. \u00a0 Our strategy is to maintain the Closed Block as required by our Plan of Reorganization over the time period of its gradual diminution as policyholder benefits are paid in full. We are permitted under the Plan of Reorganization, with the prior consent of the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance for the State of New Jersey, to enter into agreements to transfer all or any part of the risks underlying the Closed Block policies.  \u00a0 16 16 16 Table of Contents Table of Contents   Seasonality of Key Financial Items  The following chart summarizes our key areas of seasonality in our results of operations:  First QuarterSecond QuarterThird QuarterFourth QuarterPGIMHigher compensation expense(1)Other related revenues tend to be higher(2)Retirement Strategies - InstitutionalHigher reserve gains(3)Higher reserve gains(3)Lower reserve gains(3)Lower reserve gains(3)IndividualLifeLowest underwriting gainsHighest underwriting gainsAssurance IQHigher expenses ahead of annual Medicare enrollmentHigher revenue, and associated variable expenses, driven by annual Medicare enrollmentInternational BusinessesHighest premiumsLowest premiumsCorporate &OtherHigher compensation expense(1)AllBusinessesImpact of annual assumption updates(4)Higher expenses(5) __________ (1)Long-term compensation expense for retirement eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted, typically in the first quarter of each year.

We also enter into affiliated reinsurance agreements as both the ceding and assuming entity for capital management purposes. As a ceding entity, exposure to the risks reinsured is reduced by transferring certain rights and obligations of the underlying insurance product to a counterparty. Conversely, as an assuming entity, exposure to the risks reinsured is increased by assuming certain rights and obligations of the underlying insurance products from a counterparty.  We enter into reinsurance agreements as the ceding entity for a variety of reasons, but primarily do so to reduce exposure to loss, reduce risk volatility, provide additional capacity for future growth, facilitate the disposition of a block of business, and for capital management purposes. Under ceded reinsurance, we remain liable to the underlying policyholder if a third-party reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations. On a Company-wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers, monitor the concentration of counterparty risk and maintain collateral, as appropriate, to mitigate this exposure.  We enter into reinsurance agreements as the assuming entity as part of our normal product offering process (e.g., certain pension risk transfer products in our Institutional Retirement Strategies business) or in order to facilitate an acquisition of a block of business.  The following table summarizes our current uses of third-party reinsurance in each of the applicable reporting segments.

We also use numerous federal, state, common law and foreign service marks, including in particular \u201cPrudential\u201d, the \u201cPrudential logo\u201d, our \u201cRock\u201d symbol and \u201cPGIM\u201d. We believe that the value associated with many of our patents, copyrights and trade secrets, and the goodwill associated with many of our service marks, are significant competitive assets.  Since 2004, we have had an agreement with Prudential plc of the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), with whom we have no affiliation, concerning the parties\u2019 respective rights worldwide to use the names \u201cPrudential\u201d and \u201cPru.\u201d Since 2019, the agreement has also included M&G plc of the U.K., the parent of The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, following its demerger from Prudential plc. The agreement restricts use of the \u201cPrudential\u201d and \u201cPru\u201d names and marks in a number of countries outside the Americas, including Europe, Africa and most parts of Asia. Where these limitations apply, we combine our \u201cRock\u201d symbol with alternative word marks. We believe that these limitations do not materially affect our ability to operate or expand internationally. \u00a0  Regulation \u00a0 Overview \u00a0 Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect our customers and the overall financial system and not necessarily our shareholders or debt holders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined. Existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations or profitability, increase compliance costs, or increase potential regulatory exposure. In recent years we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, extensive changes in the laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks applicable to our businesses in the U.S. and internationally. We cannot predict how current or future initiatives will further impact existing laws, regulations and regulatory frameworks.  In our international businesses, regulations may apply heightened requirements to non-domestic companies, which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions, investments and other aspects of business operations and adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. In some instances, regulators of a particular country may impose different, or more rigorous laws and requirements than in the U.S. or other countries to protect customers or their financial system from perceived systemic risk, including regulations governing privacy, consumer protection, employee protection, corporate governance and capital adequacy. In addition, certain of our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that we may not face in the U.S., including the risk of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with independent contractor or franchisee status, workers\u2019 associations and trade unions, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that limit our ability to transfer funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or to convert local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some jurisdictions in which we operate joint ventures restrict our maximum percentage of ownership, which exposes us to additional operational, compliance, legal and joint venture partner risks and limits our array of potential remedies in the event of a breach by a partner.  The primary regulatory frameworks applicable to the Company are described further below under the following section headings:  \u2022Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \u2022ERISA  \u2022Fiduciary Rules and other Standards of Care \u2022U.S. State Insurance Holding Company Regulation \u2022U.S. Insurance Operations \u25e6State Insurance Regulation \u25e6U.S. Federal and State Securities Regulation Affecting Insurance Operations \u25e6U.S. Federal and State Health Insurance Plan Regulation \u25e6Other Consumer Protection Regulation \u2022International Insurance Regulation \u2022U.S. Investment and Retirement Products and Investment Management Operations \u2022U.S. Securities and Commodity Operations \u2022International Investment and Retirement Products and Investment Management Operations \u2022Derivatives Regulation \u2022Privacy and Cybersecurity Regulation 19 19 19 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Laws \u2022Environmental Laws and Regulations \u2022Unclaimed Property Laws \u2022Taxation \u25e6U.S. Taxation \u25e6International Taxation \u2022International and Global Regulatory Initiatives  Several of our domestic and foreign regulators participate in an annual supervisory college facilitated by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (\u201cNJDOBI\u201d). The purpose of the supervisory college is to promote ongoing supervisory coordination, facilitate the sharing of information among regulators and enhance each regulator\u2019s understanding of the Company\u2019s risk profile. The most recent supervisory college was held in October 2022.  Existing and future accounting rules may also impact our results of operations or financial condition. For a discussion of accounting pronouncements and their potential impact on our business, including Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2018-12, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   \u00a0Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank\u201d) increased the potential for federal regulation of our businesses. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d or the \u201cCouncil\u201d) may designate certain financial companies as a non-bank financial company (a \u201cDesignated Financial Company\u201d) subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFRB\u201d). In October 2017, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released a report titled \u201cA Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities - Asset Management and Insurance\u201d which recommended, among other things, that primary federal and state regulators should focus on potential systemic risks arising from products and activities, and on implementing regulations that strengthen the asset management and insurance industries as a whole, rather than focus on an entity-based regulatory regime. The report also affirmed the role of the U.S. state-based system of insurance regulation. In December 2019, FSOC revised its interpretive guidance regarding Designated Financial Company determinations. The guidance describes the approach FSOC intends to take in prioritizing its work to identify and address potential risks to U.S. financial stability using an activities-based approach, and enhancing the analytical rigor and transparency in the processes FSOC intends to follow if it were to consider making a Designated Financial Company determination.   The Council maintains the authority to designate entities, including the Company, for FRB supervision if it determines that either (i) material financial distress at the entity, or (ii) the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the entity\u2019s activities, could pose a threat to domestic financial stability. The Company continues to believe it does not meet the standards for designation.  We cannot predict whether Treasury reports, interpretive guidance, new legislation or other initiatives aimed at revising Dodd-Frank and regulation of the financial system will ultimately form the basis for changes to laws or regulations impacting the Company.  ERISA \u00a0 The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibitions on transactions known as \u201cprohibited transactions,\u201d such as conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a party in interest. ERISA also provides for civil and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, investment management and retirement businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. In addition to ERISA regulation of businesses providing products and services to ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA\u2019s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which transactions may be entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status. For some of the services we provide to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, we rely on an exemption from the prohibited transaction rules available, under certain circumstances, to qualified professional asset managers (\u201cQPAMs\u201d). Were we to lose our status as a QPAM, our investment management business could be adversely impacted. The loss of QPAM status could result from, among other things, us or an affiliate (potentially including a joint venture partner over whom we exercise no or limited control) being convicted of a \u201ccovered\u201d crime in the U.S. or in a foreign jurisdiction. 20 20 20 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Fiduciary Rules and Other Standards of Care  The Company and our distributors are subject to rules regarding the standard of care applicable to sales of our products and the provision of advice to our customers. In recent years, many of these rules have been revised or reexamined, as described below. We cannot predict whether any proposed or new amendments to the existing regulatory framework will ultimately become applicable to our businesses. Any new standards issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d), the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) or state regulators may affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\u00a0  DOL Fiduciary Rules  In 2016, the DOL issued a rule that redefined who would be considered a \u201cfiduciary\u201d for purposes of transactions with qualified plans, plan participants and Individual Retirement Accounts (\u201cIRAs\u201d), and generally provided that investment advice to a plan participant or IRA owner would be treated as a fiduciary activity (the \u201c2016 Rules\u201d). In 2018, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the 2016 Rules. Prior to being vacated, the 2016 Rules adversely impacted sales in our Retirement Strategies businesses and resulted in increased compliance costs. In December 2020, the DOL issued a new prohibited transaction exemption, which became effective on February 16, 2021, that replaced the previously vacated \u201cbest interest contract exemption.\u201d The new exemption allows fiduciaries meeting the requirements of the exemption to receive compensation, including as a result of advice to rollover assets from a tax-qualified plan to an IRA, and to purchase from or sell certain investments to qualified plans and IRAs. The DOL also reinstated the pre-2016 investment advice regulation and provided its current interpretation of that regulation, which could result in rollover recommendations being fiduciary investment advice if certain conditions are met. Compliance with the new exemption has resulted in increased costs, in particular in the Prudential Advisors distribution system, which we include in the results of our Individual Life segment.  SEC Best Interest Regulation  In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretative guidance that, among other things, requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail customers when recommending securities transactions or investment strategies to them. The guidance also clarifies the SEC\u2019s views of the fiduciary duty that investment advisers owe to their clients. The  best interest standards became effective on June 30, 2020. The standards apply to recommendations to purchase certain products offered by our PGIM, Retirement Strategies and Individual Life businesses, and have resulted in increased compliance costs, in particular in our Prudential Advisors distribution system, which we include in the results of our Individual Life segment.  U.S. State Standard of Care Regulation  In February 2020, the NAIC adopted revisions to the model suitability rule applicable to the sale of annuities. The revised model regulation states the insurance salesperson must act \u201cwithout placing the producer\u2019s or the insurer\u2019s financial interest ahead of the consumer\u2019s interest.\u201d The model rule will become applicable to us as it is adopted in each state, with 30 states having adopted the model to date. In addition, certain state regulators and legislatures have adopted or are considering adopting best interest standards. For example, in July 2018, the New York State Department of Financial Services (\u201cNY DFS\u201d) issued an amendment to its suitability regulations which imposes a best-interest standard on the sale of annuity and life insurance products in New York. The amendments became effective for annuity products on August 1, 2019 and for life insurance products on February 1, 2020. Also, the Massachusetts Securities Division has adopted a fiduciary standard of conduct which applies to broker-dealers and its agents.  Japan Standard of Care Regulation  Outside the U.S., in 2017 the Japanese Financial Services Agency (\u201cFSA\u201d) announced the \u201cPrinciples for Customer-Oriented Business Conduct,\u201d a set of recommended general principles for financial institutions to adopt when performing client related financial services, which was further amended in 2021. The principles have been adopted by The Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd. (\u201cPrudential of Japan\u201d), Gibraltar Life, and The Prudential Gibraltar Financial Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (\u201cPGFL\u201d). The FSA encourages voluntary adoption of these fiduciary principles as a best practice, but adoption is not required by regulation. Companies\u2019 policies regarding their fiduciary duties can be tailored based on their specific business, such as target clients and complexity of products. Once companies adopt the principles and establish a policy, they are required to publicly disclose the policy, implement measures to ensure their employees fulfill their fiduciary duties, periodically assess the measures\u2019 effectiveness and publish the progress of these measures.   21 21 21 Table of Contents Table of Contents U.S. State Insurance Holding Company Regulation \u00a0 We are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which currently include New Jersey, Arizona and Indiana, or are treated as commercially domiciled, such as New York. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company\u2019s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system, including an assessment of the group\u2019s risk management and current and future solvency position. Generally, all transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the state\u2019s insurance department. \u00a0 Change of Control  Most states, including the states in which our U.S. insurance companies are domiciled, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer\u2019s holding company. Laws such as these that apply to us prevent any person from acquiring control of Prudential Financial or of our insurance subsidiaries unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. Under most states\u2019 statutes, acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. As of January 2022, New Jersey has recognized an additional presumption of control upon the holding or controlling of enough proxies to elect 10% or more of the board of directors of a New Jersey-domiciled insurance company or its parent company. Accordingly, any person who acquires \u201ccontrol\u201d of Prudential Financial, either by the acquisition of voting securities or, in the case of New Jersey, by the accumulation of proxies without the prior approval of the applicable insurance regulator of the states in which our U.S. insurance companies are domiciled will be in violation of these states\u2019 laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities or proxies by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities or proxies and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator. In addition, many state insurance laws require prior notification to state insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. \u00a0 Group-Wide Supervision \u00a0 NJDOBI acts as the group-wide supervisor of Prudential Financial pursuant to New Jersey legislation that authorizes group-wide supervision of internationally active insurance groups (\u201cIAIGs\u201d). The law, among other provisions, authorizes NJDOBI to examine Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries, including by ascertaining the financial condition of the insurance companies for purposes of assessing enterprise risk. In accordance with this authority, NJDOBI receives information about the Company\u2019s operations beyond those of its New Jersey domiciled insurance subsidiaries. \u00a0\u00a0 Additional areas of focus regarding group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies include the following:  \u2022Group Capital Calculation. The NAIC has developed and implemented a group capital calculation that uses a risk-based capital (\u201cRBC\u201d) aggregation methodology to serve as an additional tool to help state regulators assess potential risks within and across insurance groups.   \u2022Macroprudential Framework. The NAIC is developing a macroprudential framework intended to: (1) improve state insurance regulators\u2019 ability to monitor and respond to the impact of external financial and economic risks on insurers; (2) better monitor and respond to risk emanating from or amplified by insurers that might be transmitted externally; and (3) increase public awareness of NAIC/state monitoring capabilities regarding macroprudential trends. As part of this initiative, the NAIC has identified liquidity reporting and stress testing, resolution and recovery, capital stress testing, and counterparty exposure and concentration as areas of focus.  \u2022Examination. State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. As group-wide supervisor, NJDOBI, along with our other insurance regulators, has expanded the periodic examinations to cover Prudential and all of its subsidiaries. NJDOBI, along with the insurance regulators of Arizona, Connecticut and Indiana, has commenced a global consolidated group-wide examination of Prudential and its subsidiaries for the five-year period ended December 31, 2021. We expect the examination to conclude in 2023.  22 22 22 Table of Contents Table of Contents We cannot predict what, if any, additional requirements and compliance costs any new group-wide standards will impose on Prudential Financial.  U.S. Insurance Operations \u00a0 State insurance laws regulate all aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses. State insurance departments in the fifty states, the District of Columbia and various U.S. territories and possessions monitor our insurance operations. PICA is domiciled in New Jersey and its principal insurance regulatory authority is the NJDOBI. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. Generally, our insurance products must be approved by the insurance regulators in the state in which they are sold. Our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws. \u00a0 State Insurance Regulation \u00a0 State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including: (1) licensing to transact business; (2) licensing agents; (3) admittance of assets to statutory surplus; (4) regulating premium rates for certain insurance products; (5) approving policy forms; (6) regulating unfair trade and claims practices; (7) establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards; (8) fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values; (9) regulating the type, amounts and valuations of investments permitted; (10) regulating reinsurance transactions, including the role of captive reinsurers; and (11) other matters. \u00a0 State insurance laws and regulations require our U.S. insurance companies to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do business in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. The operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. \u00a0\u00a0 Financial Regulation \u00a0 Dividend Payment Limitations. New Jersey insurance law and the insurance laws of the other states in which our insurance companies are domiciled regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by PICA and our other U.S. insurance companies. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \u00a0 Risk-Based Capital. We are subject to RBC requirements that are designed to enhance regulation of insurers\u2019 solvency. The RBC calculation, which regulators use to assess the sufficiency of an insurer\u2019s statutory capital, measures the risk characteristics of a company\u2019s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. In general, RBC is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with lower underlying risk. Insurers that have less statutory capital than required are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. \u00a0\u00a0 Areas of the RBC framework that have recently been subject to reexamination or revision include the following:  \u2022Bond Factors. In 2021, the NAIC adopted the Moody\u2019s Analytics proposed revisions to the RBC C-1 factors for invested assets effective for the year-end 2021 RBC calculation. The revisions include expanding the current NAIC designations used in the RBC calculation from six bond structures to twenty. The new factors did not materially impact our RBC calculation. The NAIC is undertaking a second phase of this project to refine capital charges for structured securities. We cannot predict what impact the second phase of this work may ultimately have on our RBC calculation.  \u2022Longevity/Mortality Risk. In 2021, the NAIC\u2019s Life Risk-Based Capital Working Group adopted longevity risk factors for some annuity products and a correlation adjustment between longevity and mortality risk factors. The Company assumes this longevity risk primarily in its Retirement Strategies businesses. The new factors did not materially impact our RBC calculation. In June 2022, the NAIC adopted new C-2 mortality factors for year-end 2022 that differentiate between products based on the length of the mortality guarantee and degree of pricing flexibility. The new factors are not expected to have a material impact on our RBC calculation.  \u2022Economic Scenario Generator (\u201cGenerator\u201d). In 2017, the American Academy of Actuaries notified the NAIC that it did not have the resources to maintain its Generator used in regulatory reserve and capital  23 23 23 Table of Contents Table of Contents calculations. In 2020, the NAIC selected a third-party vendor to provide, maintain, and support the Generator prescribed for life and annuity statutory reserve and capital calculations. Development of the new Generator is ongoing, and the NAIC expects implementation to occur no earlier than 2025. We cannot predict what impact a new Generator may ultimately have on our businesses.  Due to the ongoing nature of the NAIC\u2019s activities regarding RBC, we cannot determine the ultimate timing of the proposed changes or their impact on RBC or on our financial position. \u00a0 Insurance Reserves and Regulatory Capital. State insurance laws require us to analyze the adequacy of our reserves annually. The respective appointed actuaries for each of our life insurance companies must each submit an opinion that our reserves, when considered in light of the assets we hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for our contractual obligations and related expenses. \u00a0 The reserving framework for certain of our products and the regulatory capital requirements applicable to our business have undergone reexamination and revision in recent years, including in the following areas:  \u2022Principle-Based Reserving for Life Insurance Products. In 2016, the NAIC adopted a principle-based reserving (\u201cPBR\u201d) approach for life insurance products. Principle-based reserving replaces the reserving methods for life insurance products for which the former formulaic basis for reserves may not accurately reflect the risks or costs of the liability or obligations of the insurer. The principle-based reserving approach had a three-year phase-in period. Principle-based reserving will not affect reserves for policies in force prior to January 1, 2017.   The Company has introduced updated versions of its individual life products in conjunction with the requirement to adopt principle-based reserving by January 1, 2020. These updated products are currently priced to support the principle-based statutory reserve level without the need for reserve financing.   \u2022Variable Annuities Framework for Change. In 2019, the NAIC adopted final revisions to the Valuation Manual (\u201cVM-21\u201d) and risk-based capital instructions to implement a new variable annuity statutory framework for 2020. Changes include: (i) providing more economic reflection of hedging in liability valuations; (ii) eliminating the Standard Scenario and replacing it with the Standard Projection; and (iii) standardizing capital market assumptions and aligning frameworks for total asset requirements and reserves. There was no material impact to our target capital levels from the revised framework. In 2022, the NAIC initiated a planned review of the Standard Projection implemented in 2020. The NAIC may update prescribed assumptions and/or methodologies and will be considering whether the calculation should be a binding requirement or disclosure only.  \u2022Asset Adequacy Testing. In June 2022, the NAIC adopted Actuarial Guideline 53. The new guideline provides guidance and requires additional sensitivity tests and disclosures for complex or high yielding assets.  \u2022New York Annuity and Life Insurance Product Reserves. As a result of an agreement with the NY DFS regarding our reserving methodologies for certain variable annuity and life insurance products, certain of our New York licensed insurance subsidiaries hold additional statutory reserves on a New York basis, which reduces their New York statutory surplus. None of our U.S. operating insurance companies are domiciled in New York, and these changes do not impact statutory reserves reported in our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 states of domicile, or any states other than New York, and therefore do not impact RBC ratios; however, the agreed reserve methodologies may require us to increase our additional New York statutory reserves in the future. New York\u2019s version of PBR, which became effective in January 2020, allows for modifications to the NAIC valuation model and New York\u2019s modifications might require us to increase our New York statutory reserves. In 2022, as a result of a periodic examination, the NY DFS determined that we would be required to change certain Asset Adequacy Testing methodologies that may require us to hold additional reserves on a New York statutory basis. If we were required to establish material additional reserves on a New York statutory accounting basis or post material amounts of additional collateral with respect to individual and group annuity or insurance products, our ability to deploy capital held within our U.S. domestic insurance subsidiaries for other purposes could be affected.  \u2022Principle-Based Reserving (\u201cPBR\u201d) for Non-Variable Annuities. The NAIC is developing a principle-based reserving framework for non-variable (fixed) annuity products in the accumulation and payout phases. We cannot predict what impact a new fixed annuity PBR framework may ultimately have on our businesses. 24 24 24 Table of Contents Table of Contents  \u2022Schedule D Long-Term Bonds. The NAIC\u2019s Statutory Accounting and Principles Working Group is evaluating revisions to the definition of long-term bonds reported on Schedule D under SSAP No. 26R and SSAP No. 43R, to address the current inconsistency in practice for the reporting of non-rated residual tranches for structures captured in scope of SSAP No.43R.  \u2022Yearly Renewable Term Reinsurance Reserve Credit. In August 2021, the NAIC adopted a limit on yearly renewable term (\u201cYRT\u201d) reserve credits (Amendment Proposal Form 2020-10). The adoption requires insurers to complete the phase-in of pre-2020 PBR business by December 31, 2024, unless an insurer receives an additional extension of up to four years by their domiciliary commissioner. Prudential was granted approval for a seven-year transition along with an adjustment to the starting point for the year-ended December 31, 2021. The amendment allows a prudent level of future mortality improvement (\u201cFMI\u201d) beyond the valuation date starting in 2022. The NAIC has implemented an FMI assumption for 2022.  \u2022Credit for Reinsurance Model. During 2019, the NAIC approved revisions to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Credit for Reinsurance Model Regulation to make the models consistent with the provisions of the U.S.\u2019s bilateral covered agreements with the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) and the U.K. with respect to reinsurance collateral requirements. The revisions eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements applicable to E.U. and U.S. reinsurers meeting certain minimum requirements. The revisions also eliminate the requirements to maintain a local presence to do business in the E.U. or U.K. or post collateral in any E.U. jurisdiction or the U.K. The amended model law will become applicable to the Company as it is adopted by each domiciliary state. Each E.U. jurisdiction and the U.K. must also enact the provisions of the covered agreements into local law/regulation.  \u2022Interest Maintenance Reserve. In November 2022, in response to the rapidly rising interest rate environment, the NAIC undertook to reassess the statutory accounting treatment of negative interest maintenance reserve (\u201cIMR\u201d). Currently, negative IMR is non-admitted and reduces statutory surplus. A change to the statutory accounting treatment of negative IMR could therefore cause an increase in statutory surplus. We cannot, at this time, predict what action the NAIC may take. \u00a0 Captive Reinsurance Companies.   We use captive reinsurance subsidiaries to finance the portion of the statutory reserves for term and universal life policies that we consider to be non-economic for policies written prior to the implementation of principle-based reserving. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2014Capital\u2014Financing Activities\u2014Term and Universal Life Reserve Financing\u201d for a discussion of our life product reserves and reserve financing.   Market Conduct Regulation \u00a0 State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling, as well as underwriting and claims activity. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. We have been subject to market conduct examinations relating to our marketplace activities, including with respect to the policies and procedures we use to locate guaranteed group annuity customers and establish related reserves. Market conduct examinations by state regulatory authorities have resulted and may in the future result in us increasing statutory reserves, changing operational processes and procedures, and being subject to fines or other discipline.  Long-Term Care Rate Regulation  During 2019, the NAIC established a new Long-Term Care Insurance Task Force under the Executive Committee. It is charged with (1) developing a consistent national approach for reviewing long-term care insurance rates that result in actuarially appropriate increases being granted by the states in a timely manner and eliminates cross-state rate subsidization, and (2) ensuring consumers are provided with meaningful options to modify their contract benefits in situations where the premiums are no longer affordable due to rate increases. The rate review workgroup has developed a voluntary program for both companies and states to participate in, with full implementation targeted in 2023. It is unknown how many states or companies will participate in this program. The consumer options working group has developed guidance for states to consider during their  25 25 25 Table of Contents Table of Contents review of reduced benefit options offered by companies. Neither group has created specific regulatory requirements but these developments should enhance uniformity amongst states during rate increase requests and associated reduced benefit option reviews.  Registered Index Linked Annuities  The NAIC established the Index-Linked Variable Annuity Subgroup (\u201cSubgroup\u201d) which was charged with evaluating registered index linked annuities (\u201cRILAs\u201d) and providing recommendations and changes, as appropriate, to nonforfeiture, or interim value requirements related to the product. The Life Actuarial Task Force of the NAIC adopted a draft actuarial guideline for RILA interim value requirements, effective for contracts issued on or after July 1, 2024. We cannot predict what impact new or changes in existing regulation, or how state regulators may apply the regulations, may have on our business.  Data and Underwriting  The NAIC Accelerated Underwriting Working Group is continuing to evaluate insurers\u2019 use of external data and data analytics in accelerated life insurance underwriting. The Working Group is drafting guidance that explores the current state of the industry and its use of accelerated underwriting in life insurance and recommendations for regulators and insurers when evaluating accelerating underwriting. In addition, the NAIC is researching the use of big data and artificial intelligence, including machine learning in the business of insurance, and will evaluate existing regulatory frameworks.  Climate Change  In 2020, the NAIC established a Climate and Resiliency Task Force under the Executive Committee to coordinate domestic and international discussions and engagement on climate-related risk and resiliency issues. To date, the Task Force has implemented updates to the NAIC\u2019s annual Climate Risk Disclosure Survey and developed proposed enhancements to existing regulatory tools to address climate-related risks, which the NAIC continues to evaluate. \u00a0 Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments \u00a0 Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in the state are members and may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related to the member insurer\u2019s proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers in the state. The majority of state guaranty association laws provide a tax offset for a percentage of the assessment against future years\u2019 premium taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid $0.4 million, $0.5 million and $1 million, respectively, in assessments pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. While we cannot predict the amount and timing of future assessments on our U.S. insurance companies under these laws, we have established estimated reserves totaling approximately $29 million as of December 31, 2022, for future assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings, including Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company, Executive Life of California and Lincoln Memorial Life Insurance Company.  In 2017, the NAIC approved amendments to the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act to address issues relating to long-term care insurance-related insolvencies. The amendments will spread costs from future long-term care insurance-related insolvencies across the entire health and life insurance industry, resulting in increased assessments for life insurers. The amended model law will become applicable to us as it is adopted by each state. Prior insolvencies will not be included under these amendments. Given our current market share of the impacted lines of business, we expect our cost related to future insolvencies, net of premium tax offsets available under current state laws, would be a small percentage of the gross industry liability. \u00a0 U.S. Federal and State Securities Regulation Affecting Insurance Operations \u00a0 Our variable life insurance, variable annuity and mutual fund products generally are \u201csecurities\u201d within the meaning of federal securities laws and may be required to be registered under the federal securities laws and subject to regulation by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d). Certain of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to SEC public reporting and disclosure requirements based on offerings of these products. Federal and some state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under \u201c\u2014U.S. Investment and Retirement Products and Investment Management Operations\u201d and \u201c\u2014U.S. Securities and Commodities Regulation\u201d affect investment advice, sales and related activities with respect to these products. \u00a0 26 26 26 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our mutual funds, and in certain states our variable life insurance and variable annuity products, are also \u201csecurities\u201d within the meaning of state securities laws. As securities, these products are subject to filing and certain other requirements. Also, sales activities with respect to these products generally are subject to state securities regulation. Such regulation may affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products. \u00a0\u00a0 Federal Insurance Office \u00a0 Dodd-Frank established a Federal Insurance Office (\u201cFIO\u201d) within the Department of the Treasury headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the FIO director performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the Council, monitoring the insurance sector and representing the U.S. on prudential aspects of international insurance matters, including at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (\u201cIAIS\u201d).   U.S. Federal and State Health Insurance Plan Regulation  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), as well as state insurance laws, include numerous provisions governing the marketing and sale of health insurance plans. Congress from time to time considers health care reform that could decrease or increase the attractiveness of health insurance products sold by Assurance IQ, or have an unfavorable or favorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from sales of these products. In addition, the marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage products by Assurance IQ is subject to federal laws, regulations and guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d). In December 2022, CMS proposed certain changes to regulations governing the marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage products. If the proposed rule is enacted, these changes could impact Assurance IQ\u2019s sales processes and ability to generate case referrals to third-party marketing partners.    Other Consumer Protection Regulation  Assurance IQ engages in certain marketing, lead generation and sales activities of certain insurance products that are subject to a variety of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and other laws and regulations enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, state Attorneys General, and/or state Departments of Insurance. The NAIC is in the process of examining industry lead generation practices but has not undertaken any formal activities. Assurance IQ ceased brokering residential mortgage loan products in December 2021 but has and continues to engage in lead generation of residential mortgage loan and other personal finance products, which also are subject to a variety of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, including laws and regulations enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and/or state Departments of Banking.  International Insurance Regulation \u00a0 Our international insurance operations are principally supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including the Japanese FSA, the financial services regulator in Japan. In addition to Japan, we operate insurance companies in Argentina, Bermuda, Brazil and Mexico, and have insurance operations in China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia through joint ventures. We also have strategic investments in insurance operations in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. The insurance regulatory bodies for these businesses typically oversee such issues as: (1) company licensing; (2) the licensing of insurance sales staff; (3) insurance product approvals; (4) sales practices; (5) claims payment practices; (6) permissible investments; (7) solvency and capital adequacy; (8) insurance reserves; (9) privacy; and (10) anti-money laundering and financial crimes, among other items. In some jurisdictions, for certain products, regulators will also mandate premium rates (or components of pricing) or minimum guaranteed interest rates. Periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are among the techniques used by these regulators to supervise our non-U.S. insurance businesses. Finally, insurance regulatory authorities in the various jurisdictions in which our insurance companies are domiciled, including Japan, must approve any change of control of the insurance companies organized under their laws.  Solvency Regulation  In order to monitor insurers\u2019 solvency, regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate outside the U.S. generally establish some form of minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies, similar in concept to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators. These solvency ratios are used by regulators to assess the sufficiency of  27 27 27 Table of Contents Table of Contents an insurer\u2019s capital and claims-paying ability and include the impact of transactions with affiliated entities. Certain jurisdictions require the disclosure of solvency ratios to the public. Insurers that have lower solvency ratios than the regulators require are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy.  Japan Capital and Solvency Regulation. Our Japan insurance operations are currently subject to a capital standard known as the Solvency Margin Ratio framework (\u201cSMR\u201d). This standard prescribes the manner in which an insurance company\u2019s capital is calculated and is meant to respond to changes in financial markets, improve risk management practices of insurers and consider risks associated with the insurer\u2019s subsidiaries. The Japan FSA has in recent years asked insurance market participants to engage in a series of annual field tests of a new market based alternative to the SMR framework called the Economic Solvency Ratio (\u201cESR\u201d) that follows the Risk-based Global Insurance Capital Standard (\u201cICS\u201d) the IAIS is developing, which is described below under \u201c\u2014Other International and Global Regulatory Initiatives.\u201d We anticipate that the design of the ESR will continue to be informed by the development of the ICS and expect implementation to occur in 2026. Because of the potential for modifications to the ESR framework prior to implementation, we cannot predict what impact it may have on our businesses.   Dividend Payment Limitations  The insurance regulatory bodies in some of the countries where our international insurance businesses are located regulate the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries can pay to shareholders. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the ability of our international subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial. \u00a0 Insurance Guaranty Fund Assessments  Certain of our international insurance operations, including those in Japan, may be subject to assessments, generally based on their proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. In certain jurisdictions, we cannot predict the timing of future assessments and they may materially affect the results of operations of our international insurance operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. Under the Japanese insurance business law, all licensed life insurers in Japan are required to be members of and are assessed, on a pre-funded basis, by the Japan Policyholders Protection Corporation (\u201cPPC\u201d). These assessments generate a collective fund which is used to satisfy certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The PPC assesses each member in an amount related to its premium income and policy reserves. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid approximately $12 million, $25 million and $24 million, respectively, based on fixed currency exchange rates, in assessments pursuant to Japanese insurance guaranty association laws.  U.S. Investment and Retirement Products and Investment Management Operations \u00a0 Our retirement and investment products and services are subject to federal and state securities and fiduciary laws, ERISA, and other laws and regulations. The SEC, FINRA, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d), National Futures Association (\u201cNFA\u201d), state securities commissions, state banking and insurance departments, DOL and the Department of the Treasury are the principal U.S. regulators that regulate our retirement and investment management operations. In some cases, our domestic U.S. investment operations are also subject to non-U.S. securities laws and regulations. \u00a0\u00a0 Some of the separate account, registered fund and other pooled investment products offered by our businesses, in addition to being registered under the Securities Act, are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some states and the District of Columbia. Separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation as described above. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), as amended, and are subject to federal and state regulation. In addition, we have subsidiaries that are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our third-party advisors and licensed sales professionals within Prudential Advisors and other employees, insofar as they sell products that are securities, are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. Regulation and examination requirements also extend to various Prudential entities that employ or control those individuals.  \u00a0 Congress from time to time considers or enacts legislation that could decrease or increase the attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an unfavorable or favorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services. Over time, these changes could limit our sales of defined benefit and defined contribution pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide investment management, administrative, or other services; conversely, these changes could also increase the  28 28 28 Table of Contents Table of Contents attractiveness of certain products and services we offer in connection with such plans.  The Setting Every Community up for Retirement Enhancement (\u201cSECURE\u201d), enacted in 2020, is intended to help promote retirement plan coverage and increase retirement plan savings, as well as facilitate access to guaranteed lifetime income solutions. The SECURE Act addresses coverage issues by making it easier for small businesses to participate in pooled employer plans and requires coverage of certain long-term, part-time workers. The SECURE Act addresses savings issues by raising the cap on amounts contributed through auto-enrollment, increasing the maximum age for required minimum withdrawals to 72 and removing the age cap (70 1/2) for making IRA contributions. The SECURE Act also made it easier for employers to include guaranteed lifetime income as part of their plan by providing an annuity provider selection safe harbor, as well as providing for the portability of participant investments in annuity products. In addition, the SECURE Act included provisions that enable participants to withdraw, penalty-free, up to $5,000 for expenses attendant to the birth or adoption of a child and limit the ability of certain IRA beneficiaries to defer tax recognition of their inheritance beyond ten years. The 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, enacted on December 29, 2022, includes what is known as SECURE 2.0, which largely builds upon the changes made by the SECURE Act. Key provisions of SECURE 2.0 include, among other things, (1) increasing the age for required minimum withdrawals; (2) changes to the automatic enrollment rules for 401(k) plans; (3) allowing greater catch-up contributions and financial incentives for plan participation; (4) treating an employee's student loan payments as elective deferrals for purposes of matching contributions; and (5) new options for plan distributions.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, which waived Required Minimum Distributions for 2020, increased the amount qualified individuals may borrow from defined contribution plans from $50,000 to $100,000, and allowed qualified individuals to withdraw from defined contribution plans and individual retirement arrangements up to $100,000 penalty-free through December 31, 2020, with the withdrawal taxed over a three-year period (unless otherwise elected by the individual). The CARES Act also permitted the Company to suspend troubled debt restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) accounting under GAAP in certain circumstances for a period extending until December 31, 2021.  In December 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (\u201cCAA\u201d). The CAA includes a provision that changes the floor interest rates used for Definition of Life Insurance (\u201cDOLI\u201d) testing under Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and Modified Endowment Contract (\u201cMEC\u201d) testing under Section 7702A of the Code. The change is intended to better reflect the current low interest rate environment and, for contracts issued on or after January 1, 2021, may increase the DOLI and MEC limits and allow more premium payments relative to the death benefit.  In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\u201cARPA\u201d) was enacted. The ARPA includes, among other things, provisions intended to improve funding for multiemployer pension plans, including providing special financial assistance through the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to qualifying underfunded plans and adding five years to the funding improvement period and the rehabilitation period for plans that were in endangered or critical status in 2020 or 2021. The ARPA includes single-employer pension funding relief in the form of interest rate stabilization and an extension of the period for amortizing funding shortfalls. \u00a0 U.S. Securities and Commodity Operations \u00a0 We have subsidiaries that are broker-dealers or investment advisers. The SEC, the CFTC, state securities authorities, FINRA, the NFA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and similar authorities are, as applicable, the principal regulators of these subsidiaries. \u00a0 Our broker-dealer and commodities affiliates are members of, and are subject to regulation by, \u201cself-regulatory organizations,\u201d including FINRA and the NFA, as applicable. Self-regulatory organizations conduct examinations of, and have adopted rules governing, their members. In addition, state securities and certain other regulators have regulatory and oversight authority over our registered broker-dealers. Broker-dealers and their sales forces in the U.S. and in certain other jurisdictions are subject to regulations that cover many aspects of the securities business, including sales methods and trading practices. The regulations cover the suitability of investments for individual customers, use and safekeeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, financial reporting and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. The SEC, CFTC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of a broker-dealer, an investment adviser or commodities firm or its employees. Our U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to federal net capital requirements that may limit the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.  29 29 29 Table of Contents Table of Contents International Investment and Retirement Products and Investment Management Operations  Our non-insurance international operations are supervised primarily by regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. We operate investment-related businesses in, among other jurisdictions, Japan, Taiwan, the U.K., Ireland, India, Hong Kong, Mexico, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, China and Singapore, and participate in investment-related joint ventures in China and South Africa and in a retirement related joint venture with operations in Chile, Peru and Columbia. These businesses may provide products such as investment management products and services, funds, separately managed accounts and retirement products. The regulatory authorities for these businesses typically oversee such issues as: (1) company licensing; (2) the licensing of investment product sales staff; (3) sales practices; (4) solvency and capital adequacy; (5) fund product approvals and related disclosures; and (6) securities, commodities, retirement, pension and related laws, among other items. In some cases, our international investment operations are also subject to U.S. securities laws and regulations.  Derivatives Regulation \u00a0 Prudential Financial and our subsidiaries use derivatives for various purposes, including hedging interest rate, foreign currency and equity market exposures. Dodd-Frank established a framework for regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives markets. This framework sets out requirements regarding the clearing and reporting of derivatives transactions, as well as collateral posting requirements for uncleared swaps. Affiliated swaps entered into between our subsidiaries are generally exempt from most of these requirements.  \u00a0 We continue to monitor the potential hedging cost impacts of new initial margin requirements, and increased capital requirements for derivatives transactions. Additionally, the increased need to post cash collateral in connection with mandatorily cleared swaps may also require the liquidation of higher yielding assets for cash, resulting in a negative impact on investment income.  Privacy and Cybersecurity Regulation \u00a0 We are subject to laws, regulations and directives that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal, proprietary, or other non-public information, including intellectual property, health-related, and customer information, and to notify their customers and other appropriate individuals of their policies and practices relating to the collection, use and disclosure of such information. In addition, we are subject to international data protection and privacy laws, regulations, and directives concerning the safeguarding and protection of personal information, including as such laws relate to the cross border transfer or use of personal information.   These laws, regulations and directives also: \u00a0 \u2022require protections regarding or limiting the use and disclosure of certain sensitive personal information such as national identifier numbers (e.g., social security numbers) or racial or ethnic origin; \u2022require notice to affected individuals, regulators and others if there is a breach of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of certain personal or confidential information; \u2022require financial institutions and creditors to implement effective programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft; \u2022regulate the process by which financial institutions make telemarketing calls and send e-mail, text, or fax messages to consumers and customers;  \u2022require oversight of third parties that have access to, and handle, personal or confidential information;  \u2022provide individuals with certain rights over their personal information, such as the right to know what personal information is being collected and whether the information is being sold or shared, and the right to obtain portable copies of or request the deletion or correction of their personal information; and \u2022prescribe the permissible uses of certain personal information, including customer information and consumer report information.  Some countries have also instituted laws requiring in-country data processing and/or in-country storage of the personal information of its citizens, personal information collection in the jurisdiction, or other categories of in-scope data. Compliance with such laws may result in higher technology, administrative and other costs for us and affect how products and services are offered or require us to structure our businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways.  30 30 30 Table of Contents Table of Contents Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cybersecurity continues to increase worldwide. Financial regulators in the U.S. and international jurisdictions in which we operate continue to focus on data privacy and cybersecurity, including in proposed rulemaking, and have communicated heightened expectations and have increased emphasis in this area in their examinations of regulated entities. For example, the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, confers additional privacy rights on individuals in the E.U. and establishes significant penalties for violations. In addition, in the U.S., certain lawmakers in Congress have proposed a number of sweeping privacy laws. In California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) became effective in 2020 and confers numerous privacy rights on individuals and corresponding obligations on businesses. Additional rights and obligations will be imposed by the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d), which amends the CCPA and will become effective in 2023. Additional states, such as Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia have also passed comprehensive privacy laws similar in scope to the CCPA and CPRA that will also become effective in 2023. The NAIC is drafting updated model privacy legislation that will likely be completed in 2023, with states beginning to adopt the model in 2024. Internationally, a number of countries such as Brazil and Japan have enacted GDPR-like regulations, while others, such as India and Argentina, are considering such regulations or, in the case of China, have enacted other privacy and data security regulations. \u00a0 In October 2017, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law. The model law requires that insurance companies establish a cybersecurity program and includes specific technical safeguards as well as requirements regarding governance, incident planning, data management, system testing, vendor oversight and regulator notification. The NY DFS adopted a similar regulation effective March 2017 and released its proposed amendments to the regulation in November 2022, which are expected to become effective in 2023. Other states have either implemented the Model Law or are anticipated to implement it or similar laws in the near future.   The Company is monitoring regulatory guidance and rulemaking in these areas, and may be subject to increased compliance costs and regulatory requirements. In order to respond to the threat of security breaches and cyber-attacks, we have developed a program overseen by the Chief Information Security Officer and the Information Security Office that is designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of all information owned by, or in the care of the Company. As part of this program, we also maintain an incident response plan. The program provides for the coordination of various corporate functions and governance groups and serves as a framework for the execution of responsibilities across businesses and operational roles. Among other things, the program establishes security standards for our technological resources and includes training for employees, contractors and third parties. As part of the program, we conduct periodic exercises with independent outside advisors to assess the effectiveness of our program and our internal response preparedness. We regularly engage with the broader security community and monitor cyber threat information.  Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Laws \u00a0 Our businesses are subject to various anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and regulations that seek to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. In addition, under current U.S. law and regulations we may be prohibited from dealing with certain individuals or entities in certain circumstances and we may be required to monitor customer activities, which may affect our ability to attract and retain customers. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.\u2019s Anti-Bribery Law. The obligation of financial institutions, including the Company, to identify their clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to monitor dealings with government officials, to respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with other financial institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.\u00a0  Environmental Laws and Regulations \u00a0 Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to our ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, we seek to minimize this risk by undertaking environmental assessments, among other measures prior to taking title to real estate. \u00a0 Unclaimed Property Laws \u00a0 We are subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and we are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. For additional discussion of these matters, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \u00a0 31 31 31 Table of Contents Table of Contents Taxation  U.S. Taxation \u00a0 The Company and certain domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return that includes both life insurance companies and non-life insurance companies. The principal differences between the Company\u2019s actual income tax expense and the applicable statutory federal income tax rate are generally deductions for non-taxable investment income, including the Dividends Received Deduction (\u201cDRD\u201d), foreign taxes applied at a different tax rate than the U.S. rate and certain tax credits. For tax years starting in 2018, the applicable statutory federal income tax rate is 21%. A future increase in the applicable statutory federal income tax rate above 21% would adversely impact the Company\u2019s tax position. In addition, as discussed further below, the tax attributes of our products may impact both the Company\u2019s and our customers\u2019 tax positions. See \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company\u2019s tax position. As discussed further below, new tax legislation and other potential changes to the tax law may impact the Company\u2019s tax position and the attractiveness of our products.  The Tax Act of 2017 changed the taxation of businesses and individuals by lowering tax rates and broadening the tax base through the acceleration of taxable income and the deferral or elimination of certain deductions, as well as changing the system of taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The most significant changes for the Company were: (1) the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) revised methodologies for determining deductions for tax reserves and the DRD; (3) an increased capitalization and amortization period for acquisition costs related to certain products; and (4) the change from a worldwide deferred taxation system to a modified territorial system of taxation on applicable earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which includes (a) a new tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) provision ) and (b) a new alternative tax with respect to payments to non-U.S. affiliates that are at least 25% owned (the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d)).  The GILTI provision applies a minimum U.S. tax to earnings of foreign subsidiaries in excess of a 10% deemed return on tangible assets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries by imposing the U.S. tax rate to 50% of earnings of such foreign affiliates and provides for a partial foreign tax credit for foreign income taxes. The amount of tax in any period on GILTI can depend on annual differences between U.S. taxable income recognition rules and taxable income recognition rules in the country of operations and the overall taxable income of U.S. operations, as well as U.S. expense allocation rules which limit the amount of foreign tax credits that can be applied to reduce the U.S. tax on the GILTI. Under certain circumstances, the taxable income of U.S. operations may cause more than 50% of earnings of foreign affiliates to be subject to the GILTI provision. In years that the U.S. consolidated PFI group incurs a net operating loss or has a loss from domestic businesses, including as a result of loss carrybacks, the GILTI provision would operate to cause a loss of U.S. tax benefits for some or all of those losses, effectively increasing the tax on foreign earnings.  The BEAT provision could, under certain conditions, increase our tax expense. The BEAT is an alternative tax implicated if tax deductible payments from U.S. companies to foreign affiliates that are at least 25% owned exceed 3% of total U.S. tax deductions. If implicated, the BEAT taxes modified taxable income at a rate of 10% beginning in 2019, and increasing to 12.5% in 2026, and is due if the calculated BEAT tax amount that is determined without the benefit of foreign and certain other tax credits is greater than the regular corporate tax in any given year. In general, modified taxable income is calculated by adding back to a taxpayer\u2019s regular taxable income the amount of certain \u201cbase erosion tax benefits\u201d with respect to payments to foreign affiliates, as well as the \u201cbase erosion percentage\u201d of any net operating loss deductions.   Since the enactment of the Tax Act of 2017, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) promulgated Proposed and Final Regulations on a number of provisions within or impacted by the Tax Act of 2017, including GILTI, foreign tax credits, net interest deductibility and the BEAT. Regulations were issued making it clear that benefit and claim payments made by our U.S. insurance businesses to our foreign affiliates on reinsurance assumed by the U.S. affiliates should not be considered to be base erosion payments. During 2020, regulations were issued that allow taxpayers to elect to exclude income of foreign subsidiaries from being subject to tax under the GILTI provision if the income of the foreign subsidiary is subject to local tax in excess of 18.9%. Other life insurance and financial services companies may benefit more or less from these tax law changes, which could impact the Company\u2019s overall competitive position. Notwithstanding the enactment of the Tax Act of 2017, the President, and Congress, as well as state and local governments, may continue to consider from time to time legislation that could increase the amount of corporate taxes we pay, thereby reducing earnings.   In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress enacted the CARES Act. One provision of the CARES Act amends the Tax Act of 2017 and allows companies with net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) originating in 2018, 2019 or 2020 to carry back those losses for up to five years.  32 32 32 Table of Contents Table of Contents In January 2022, the Treasury Department and the IRS promulgated Final Regulations (the \u201cFinal FTC Regulations\u201d) changing the criteria by which a foreign levy is treated as a foreign income tax or a tax in lieu of an income tax for which a foreign tax credit may be claimed. The Final FTC Regulations are effective for tax years beginning on or after December 28, 2021. The Final FTC Regulations provide that a foreign levy must satisfy an attribution or jurisdictional nexus rule to be a creditable foreign income tax. A foreign levy will not satisfy the jurisdictional nexus requirement if the foreign country\u2019s transfer pricing rules do not require that the arm\u2019s length principles apply. Brazil\u2019s tax law may not follow arm\u2019s length principles; therefore, as a result of the Final FTC Regulations, the Company may not be entitled to a foreign tax credit with respect to Brazil.   In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d). Among other provisions, the Inflation Reduction Act imposes (1) a 15% alternative minimum tax on corporations (\u201cCAMT\u201d) with average applicable financial statement income over $1 billion for any three-year period ending with 2022 or later; and (2) a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock that is repurchased by publicly traded U.S. corporations or their specified affiliates. Both provisions are effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The impact of the alternative minimum tax, if any, will vary from year to year based on the relationship of our GAAP income to our taxable income. Additionally, there remain several open items with respect to the application of the alternative minimum tax on corporations, including how to apply the provision to insurance company separate accounts and certain forms of reinsurance, which will inform how and to what degree this tax impacts the Company.  The U.S. federal tax law provides that an election may be made pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 952 (the \u201c952 election\u201d) to subject earnings from certain insurance operations to tax in the U.S. in the tax year earned, net of related foreign tax credits. The Company made the 952 election effective for the 2017 and later tax years with respect to its affiliates incorporated in Brazil. In October 2019, the IRS issued a legal memorandum applicable to all taxpayers in which the IRS argues that the election became inoperable in 1998. The Company disagrees with the IRS\u2019s position and the matter is now pending before IRS Independent Office of Appeals. If the Company is ultimately not successful, it will not be able to claim a U.S. tax credit for the Brazil taxes in excess of the U.S. tax rate, and thus will have a higher tax expense over time. For additional information regarding the 952 Election, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company has a number of subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. Those non-U.S. subsidiaries intend to operate in a manner that will not cause any to be treated as being engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. or subject to current U.S. federal income taxation on their net income. However, because there is uncertainty as to when a foreign corporation is engaged in a trade or business within the United States, as the determination is highly factual and must be made annually, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that a non-U.S. Company is engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. If a non-U.S. Company were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., it could be subject to U.S. federal income taxation and possible state taxation on a net basis on its income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business (including branch profits tax on the portion of its earnings and profits that is attributable to such income). Any such taxation could result in substantial tax liabilities.  U.S. federal tax law generally permits tax deferral on the inside build-up of investment value of certain retirement savings, annuities and life insurance products until there is a contract distribution and, in general, excludes from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance contract. The Tax Act of 2017 did not change these rules, though it is possible that some individuals with overall lower effective tax rates could be less attracted to the tax deferral aspect of the Company\u2019s products. The general reduction in individual tax rates and elimination of certain individual deductions may also impact the Company, depending on whether current and potential customers have more or less after-tax income to save for retirement and manage their mortality and longevity risk through the purchase of the Company\u2019s products. Congress from time to time may enact other changes to the tax law that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would modify the tax favored treatment of retirement savings, life insurance and annuities products.  The products we sell have different tax characteristics and, in some cases, generate tax deductions and credits for the Company. Changes in either the U.S. or foreign tax laws may negatively impact the deductions and credits available to the Company, including the ability of the Company to claim foreign tax credits with respect to taxes withheld on our investments supporting separate account products. These changes would increase the Company\u2019s actual tax expense and reduce its consolidated net income.  The profitability of certain products is significantly dependent on these characteristics and our ability to continue to generate taxable income, which is taken into consideration when pricing products and is a component of our capital management strategies. Accordingly, changes in tax law, our ability to generate taxable income, or other factors impacting the  33 33 33 Table of Contents Table of Contents availability or value of the tax characteristics generated by our products, could impact product pricing, increase our tax expense or require us to reduce our sales of these products or implement other actions that could be disruptive to our businesses.  International Taxation   Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could impact the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products. For example, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) continues to study and make recommendations with respect to model global base erosion tax options that are being considered and may be adopted by foreign governments. In 2021, as part of its Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two), the OECD recommended a 15% global minimum tax on adjusted financial reported income. Many jurisdictions, including Japan, the European Union, the United Kingdom and South Korea, have adopted or announced an intention to adopt Pillar Two for tax years beginning in 2024. There are several open items with respect to the possible application of the proposed rules which will determine how and to what degree this tax impacts the Company.  The Japan national corporate tax rate is 23.2% for tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2018. In addition, there are local income taxes that are applied to our income earned in Japan. Insurance commissions paid to our Life Planners and Life Consultants are subject to a 10% consumption tax for individuals exceeding certain earnings thresholds; however, the tax is not charged on employee compensation (other than commissions) or insurance premiums.  In July 2019, the Japan National Tax Authority issued rules limiting policyholders\u2019 tax deductions for premiums paid on certain corporate insurance products. For information regarding sales of corporate insurance products within our international insurance operations, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Results of Operations by Segment\u2014International Businesses.\u201d \u00a0 International and Global Regulatory Initiatives \u00a0 In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, lawmakers around the world are actively exploring steps to avoid future financial crises. In many respects, this work is being led by the Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d), which consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20, the FSB and related bodies have developed proposals to address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including executive compensation, and a host of related issues.  In July 2013, we, along with eight other global insurers, were designated by the FSB as a global systemically important insurer (\u201cG-SII\u201d) through a quantitative methodology developed and implemented by the IAIS. We remained designated as a G-SII until November 2018, at which point the FSB announced that it would not engage in an identification of G-SIIs based on the IAIS\u2019 progress with development of the Holistic Framework for Systemic Risk in the Insurance Sector (\u201cHolistic Framework\u201d). The Holistic Framework, which was adopted by the IAIS in November 2019, focuses on employing an Activities Based approach (\u201cABA\u201d) to assessing and managing potential sources of systemic risk through enhancements to IAIS policy measures pertaining to macroprudential surveillance, enterprise risk management, liquidity management, crisis management and recovery planning. In addition to the ABA elements, the Holistic Framework preserves the IAIS\u2019 annual data collection and monitoring process. Upon the IAIS\u2019 adoption of the Holistic Framework, the FSB initially suspended and in December 2022 discontinued the annual identification of G-SIIs. The FSB will now utilize assessments available through the Holistic Framework to evaluate systemic risk in the insurance sector.  In addition to its post financial crisis work on systemic risk, the IAIS developed the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (\u201cComFrame\u201d). Through ComFrame, the IAIS seeks to promote effective and globally consistent supervision of the insurance industry through uniform standards for insurer corporate governance, enterprise risk management and other control functions, group-wide supervision and group capital adequacy. The non-capital related components of ComFrame were adopted by the IAIS in November 2019. The ICS, which is the capital adequacy component of ComFrame, entered a five-year monitoring phase beginning in 2020. During the monitoring phase, IAIGs are encouraged to report ICS results to their group supervisory authorities to support the IAIS\u2019 efforts to obtain feedback on the appropriateness of the framework. The IAIS will use input from supervisory authorities and IAIGs as well as stakeholder feedback on a public consultation and the results of an economic impact assessment to further improve the ICS. The IAIS is scheduled to adopt a final version of the ICS, which it expects its member supervisory authorities to implement, in 2025.  As a standard setting body, the IAIS does not have direct authority to require insurance companies to comply with the policy measures it develops, including the ICS and proposed policy measures within the Holistic Framework. However, we could become subject to these policy measures if they were adopted by either our group supervisor or supervisors of our  34 34 34 Table of Contents Table of Contents international operations or companies, which could impact the manner in which we deploy our capital, structure and manage our businesses, and otherwise operate both within the U.S. and abroad.

The percentages set forth in this row are not intended to equal the sum of the percentages in the rows below.  Prudential\u2019s Board of Directors, including its Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee, has oversight responsibility for our human capital resources, diversity and inclusion practices and corporate culture. Human capital is discussed by management at every Board meeting and, at least once per year, the Board devotes time to discuss human capital at each business and functional leadership level across the Company.  Attracting Employees  We believe that our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented, skilled, and motivated employees. We aim to attract individuals who share our commitment to creating accessible financial solutions that meet the long-term objectives of our global customers. Building a diverse and inclusive organization is a component of our strategic business initiative.  Developing Employees  We believe that all employees deserve equal access to career opportunities. We have enhanced our talent practices and centralized career tools in our Talent Marketplace, an interactive and innovative platform that brings training, career advancement opportunities, and a career advisory program, together in one place. The Talent Marketplace offers employees the opportunity to grow as Prudential grows. Regardless of our employees\u2019 level, business or function, all have access to Prudential\u2019s talent tools, delivering on our commitment to advance and modernize our talent practices to offer equal opportunities to all employees to learn and grow.  Also, we require U.S. employees to attend training programs addressing core issues such as understanding racism and everyday bias, building cultural intelligence, and using tools and techniques to support an inclusive culture. The goal of these training programs is for all employees to develop a baseline understanding of these concepts, which we expect will better equip us to solve the financial challenges of our increasingly diverse customers. During 2022, the majority of our U.S. employees attended such training programs.  35 35 35 Table of Contents Table of Contents Retaining Employees  We believe that our rigorous talent acquisition process, provision of opportunities for professional enrichment and advancement throughout our employees\u2019 careers, and our inclusive culture will enhance our ability to retain employees.  Prudential conducts a global employee engagement survey, entitled the \u201cEQ Survey\u201d. The EQ Survey solicits employee feedback addressing our culture, management, career opportunities, compensation and benefits. The results of the EQ Survey influence how we strengthen our culture and implement change within the Company. In 2022, over 88% of our eligible global employees responded to the EQ Survey.  Prudential\u2019s annual turnover rate (including voluntary and involuntary terminations) in 2022 was 12.4%. Voluntary turnover among Prudential\u2019s U.S. workforce was 9.2%. In 2022, Prudential filled over 3,800 positions in the United States and 32% of those positions were filled internally.  Protecting and supporting our employees is a priority at Prudential. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly transitioned more than 97% of our U.S. workforce to remote working in a matter of days. During 2022, most of our workforce transitioned from fully remote work to a hybrid work arrangement.  Diversity and Inclusion at Prudential  We view inclusion, diversity and racial equity as a moral and business imperative. Our inclusive approach to human capital management starts with our Board of Directors. Our Board embodies diversity: 80% of Prudential\u2019s independent directors are diverse. Our commitment to advance racial equity spans our talent practices, how we design and deliver our products, our investments and public policy work, and our support of community institutions.  To reinforce our commitment to diversity and inclusion, we use a diversity modifier in our long-term incentive program that ties the long-term incentive compensation of senior management to a performance objective based on the achievement of improved diversity outcomes across the organization.  Compensation Program and Retirement Plans  The philosophy underlying our compensation program is to provide an attractive, flexible, and market-based total compensation program tied to performance and aligned with the interests of our shareholders. Our objective is to recruit and retain the caliber of employees necessary to deliver sustained high performance to our shareholders, customers, and communities. Our compensation program is an important component of these overall human resources policies. Equally important, we view compensation practices as a means for communicating our goals and standards of conduct and performance and for motivating and rewarding employees in relation to their achievements.  We view retirement benefits as a key component of our compensation program because they encourage long-term service. Accordingly, we offer our employees a comprehensive benefits program that provides the opportunity to accumulate retirement income. This program includes both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.   Periodically, we compare the competitiveness of our benefits programs for our employees, including retirement benefits, against other employers with whom we broadly compete for talent. It is our objective to provide our employees with a benefits package that is at or around the median of the competitive market when compared to other employers. \u00a0 Available Information \u00a0 Prudential Financial files periodic and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.
