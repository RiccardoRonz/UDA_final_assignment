{"cik": 1099800, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overview  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation is the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring. Driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with the world\u2019s leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or who require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery or in intensive care.  Edwards Lifesciences has been a leader in our field for over six decades.  Since our founder, Lowell Edwards, first dreamed of using engineering to address diseases of the human heart, we have steadily built a company on the premise of imagining, building, and realizing a better future for patients.  A pioneer in the development of heart valve therapies, we are the world's leading manufacturer of heart valve systems and repair products used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve. Our innovative work in heart valves encompasses both surgical and transcatheter therapies for heart valve replacement and repair.  In addition, our robust pipeline of future technologies is focused on the less invasive repair or replacement of the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart, which are more complex and more challenging to treat than the aortic valve that is currently the focus of many of our commercially approved valve technologies.  We are also a global leader in hemodynamic and noninvasive brain and tissue oxygenation monitoring systems used to measure a patient's cardiovascular function in the hospital setting.   Cardiovascular disease is the number-one cause of death in the world and is the top disease in terms of health care spending in nearly every country. Cardiovascular disease is progressive in that it tends to worsen over time and often affects the structure of an individual's heart.  Patients undergoing treatment for cardiovascular disease can be treated with a number of our medical technologies, which are designed to address individual patient needs with respect to disease process, comorbidities, and health status. For example, an individual with a heart valve disorder may have a faulty valve that is affecting the function of his or her heart or blood flow throughout his or her body. A cardiac surgeon may elect to remove the valve and replace it with one of our bioprosthetic surgical tissue heart valves or surgically re-shape and repair the faulty valve with an Edwards Lifesciences annuloplasty ring.  Alternatively, a clinician (typically an interventional cardiologist) may implant an Edwards Lifesciences transcatheter valve or repair system via a catheter-based approach that does not require traditional open-heart surgery and can be done while the heart continues to beat. Patients in the hospital setting, including high-risk patients in the operating room or intensive care unit, are candidates for having their cardiac function or fluid levels monitored by our Critical Care products through multiple monitoring options, including noninvasive and minimally-invasive technologies.  These technologies enable proactive clinical decisions while also providing the opportunity for improving diagnoses and developing individualized therapeutic management plans for patients.  Corporate Background  Our principal executive offices are located at One Edwards Way, Irvine, California 92614. The telephone number at that address is (949)\u00a0250-2500. We make available, free of charge on our website located at www.edwards.com, our annual report on Form\u00a010-K, quarterly reports on Form\u00a010-Q, current reports on Form\u00a08-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this report.  Edwards Lifesciences' Product and Technology Offerings  The following discussion summarizes the main areas of products and technologies we offer to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. Our products and technologies are categorized into four main areas:  Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies, Surgical Structural Heart, and Critical Care.  For more information on net sales from these four main areas, see \"Net Sales by Product Group\" in Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"   Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement   We are the global leader in transcatheter heart valve replacement technologies designed for the minimally-invasive replacement of aortic heart valves. The Edwards SAPIEN family of valves, including Edwards SAPIEN XT, the Edwards SAPIEN 3, the Edwards SAPIEN 3 Ultra, and the Edwards SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA transcatheter heart valves, and their respective delivery systems, are used to treat heart valve disease using catheter-based approaches for patients who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and certain patients with congenital heart disease. Delivered while the heart is beating, these valves  2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents  can enable patients to experience a better quality of life sooner than patients receiving traditional surgical therapies. We began offering our transcatheter aortic heart valves to patients commercially in Europe in 2007, in the United States in 2011, and in Japan in 2013.  Supported by extensive customer training and service, and a growing body of compelling clinical evidence, our SAPIEN family of transcatheter aortic heart valves are the most widely prescribed transcatheter heart valves in the world.  Sales of our transcatheter aortic valve replacement products represented 65% of our net sales in each of 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies  We continue to make significant investments in the development of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases. While many of these technologies are in development and clinical phases, the PASCAL PRECISION and Cardioband transcatheter valve repair systems are commercially available in Europe for mitral and tricuspid valve repair. As of 2022, the PASCAL PRECISION system is also commercially available in the U.S. for degenerative mitral regurgitation patients.  The PASCAL PRECISION system addresses the needs of patients with mitral or tricuspid regurgitation through leaflet approximation, while the Cardioband system enables clinicians to reduce the valve's annulus and lower regurgitation. In addition to transcatheter repair, we believe transcatheter replacement is key to unlocking the full mitral and tricuspid opportunity. We believe our two-platform mitral replacement strategy positions us for leadership in the mid-to-long term. SAPIEN M3 is based on the proven SAPIEN valve while EVOQUE Eos is designed specifically for mitral patients.  For tricuspid valve replacement, our EVOQUE system is also sub 30-French, and available in a variety of valve sizes to enable treatment in a wide range of patient anatomies.  Surgical Structural Heart  We are innovating in the field of cardiac surgical therapies to improve the quality of life for patients.  Our RESILIA tissue, with published clinical data showing 0% structural valve deterioration through five years1, is helping us redefine tissue durability standards. Our latest innovation, the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, is built on our PERIMOUNT platform, offering RESILIA tissue and VFit technology. INSPIRIS is the leading aortic surgical valve in the world. Sales of our surgical therapies in the United States also continue to gain traction with KONECT RESILIA, the first pre-assembled, aortic tissue valved conduit.   The MITRIS RESILIA valve, our newest mitral valve incorporating our latest tissue technology, is now commercially available in both the U.S. and Japan. We believe the demand for surgical structural heart therapies is growing worldwide, and that our innovation strategy will continue to strengthen our leadership and positive impact on patients.  Sales of our surgical tissue heart valve products represented 15%, 15%, and 16% of our net sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  Critical Care  We are the world leader in advanced hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient's heart function and fluid status in surgical and intensive care settings. Edwards\u2019 complete hemodynamic portfolio helps clinicians make proactive clinical decisions that can improve patient recovery.  The portfolio includes the minimally-invasive FloTrac and Acumen IQ sensors, the noninvasive ClearSight and Acumen IQ cuffs, and the ForeSight noninvasive tissue oximetry sensor. We also support clinical needs with our well-established Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheters and arterial pressure monitoring products. Compatible with our portfolio of sensors and catheters, the HemoSphere monitoring platform displays valuable physiological information.  Our first predictive algorithm, Acumen Hypotension Prediction Index software, alerts clinicians in advance of a patient developing dangerously low blood pressure.  Our latest algorithm, Acumen Assisted Fluid Management software, provides patient-specific fluid suggestions to help keep patients in an optimal range during surgery.        1 Bavaria, et al.

We compete with divisions of larger companies as well as smaller companies that offer competitive product lines in certain geographies in which we operate. We also compete with both established and newer technologies that target the patients served by our products. New product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including drug therapies. We believe we hold leadership positions because we develop and produce safe and effective therapies supported by rigorous clinical studies with extensive data and with innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product performance, and reliability; these superior clinical outcomes are in part due to the level of customer and clinical support we provide.   The cardiovascular segment of the medical technology industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to cost-of-care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs. The ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical technology manufacturers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We believe that we are a leading global competitor in each of our product lines. In Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, our primary competitors include Medtronic PLC and Abbott Laboratories (\"Abbott\"). In Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies, our primary competitor is Abbott, and there are a considerable number of large and small companies with development efforts in these fields. In Surgical Structural Heart, our primary competitors include Medtronic PLC, Abbott, and Artivion, Inc (formerly CryoLife). In Critical Care, we compete primarily with a variety of companies in specific product lines including ICU Medical,\u00a0Inc., PULSION Medical Systems SE, a subsidiary of Getinge AB, Cheetah Medical, Inc., a subsidiary of Baxter International, and LiDCO Group\u00a0PLC, a subsidiary of Masimo Corporation.   Sales and Marketing  Our portfolio includes some of the most recognizable cardiovascular device product brands in treating structural heart disease today.  We have a number of product lines that require sales and marketing strategies tailored to deliver high-quality, cost-effective products and technologies to customers worldwide. Because of the diverse global needs of the population that we serve, our distribution system consists of several direct sales forces as well as independent distributors.  We are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in 2022.  To ensure optimal outcomes for patients, we conduct educational symposia and best practices training for our physician, hospital executive, service line leadership, nursing, and clinical-based customers.  We rely extensively on our sales and field clinical specialist personnel who work closely with our customers in hospitals.  Field clinical specialists routinely attend procedures where Edwards' products are being used in order to provide guidance on the use of our devices, thereby enabling physicians and staff to reach expert proficiency and deliver positive patient outcomes.  Our customers include physicians, nurses, and other clinical personnel, but can also include decision makers such as service line leaders, material managers, biomedical staff, hospital administrators and executives, purchasing managers, and ministries of health. Also, for certain of our product lines and where appropriate, our corporate sales team actively pursues approval of Edwards Lifesciences as a qualified supplier for hospital group purchasing organizations (\"GPOs\") that negotiate contracts with suppliers of medical products. Additionally, we have contracts with a number of United States and European national and regional buying groups, including healthcare systems and Integrated Delivery Networks.  Where we choose to market our products is also influenced by the existence of, or potential for, adequate reimbursement to hospitals and other providers by national healthcare systems.   United States.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the United States, we sell substantially all of our products through our direct sales forces. In 2022, 58% of our net sales were derived from sales to customers in the United States.  Outside of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2022, 42% of our net sales were derived outside of the United States through our direct sales forces and independent distributors. Of the total sales outside of the United States, 52% were in Europe, 21% were in Japan, and 27% were in Rest of World. We sell our products in approximately 100 countries, including Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, China, and Canada. A majority of the sales and marketing approach outside of the United States is direct sales, although it varies depending on each country's size and state of development.  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Raw Materials and Manufacturing  We operate manufacturing facilities in various geographies around the world. We manufacture our Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid technologies, and Structural Surgical Heart products primarily in the United States (California and Utah), Singapore, Costa Rica, and Ireland. We manufacture our Critical Care products primarily in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.   We use a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials in the design, development, and manufacture of our products. We manufacture our non-implantable products from fabricated raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics, and metals. Most of our replacement heart valves are manufactured from natural tissues harvested from animal tissue as well as fabricated materials. We purchase certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of sole source availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.  We work with our suppliers to mitigate risk and seek continuity of supply while maintaining quality and reliability. Alternative supplier options are generally considered, identified, and approved for materials deemed critical to our products, although we do not typically pursue immediate regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process.  We comply with all current global guidelines regarding risks for products incorporating animal tissue intended to be implanted in humans.  We follow rigorous sourcing and manufacturing procedures intended to safeguard humans from potential risks associated with diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\"BSE\"). We obtain bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products only from sources within the United States and Australia, where strong control measures and surveillance programs exist. In addition, bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility. Our manufacturing and sterilization processes are designed to render tissue biologically safe from all known infectious agents and viruses.  Quality Assurance  We are committed to providing quality products to our patients and have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization. The quality system starts with the initial design concept, risk management, and product specification, and continues through the design of the product, packaging and labeling, and the manufacturing, sales, support, and servicing of the product. The quality system is intended to design quality into the products and uses continuous improvement concepts, including Lean/Six Sigma principles, throughout the product lifecycle.  Our operations are frequently inspected by the many regulators that oversee medical device manufacturing, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), European Notified Bodies, and other regulatory entities.  The medical technology industry is highly regulated and our facilities and operations are designed to comply with all applicable quality systems standards, including the International Organization for Standardization (\"ISO\") 13485. These standards require, among other items, quality system controls that are applied to product design, component material, suppliers, and manufacturing operations. These regulatory approvals and ISO certifications can be obtained only after a successful audit of a company's quality system has been conducted by regulatory or independent outside auditors. Periodic reexamination by an independent outside auditor is required to maintain these certifications.  Environmental, Health, and Safety  We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace and complying with all relevant regulations and medical technology industry standards. Through our corporate and site level Environmental, Health, and Safety functions, we establish and monitor programs to reduce pollution, prevent injuries, and maintain compliance with applicable regulations. In order to measure performance, we monitor and report on a number of metrics, including regulated and non-regulated waste disposal, energy usage, water consumption, air toxic emissions, and injuries from our production activities. Each of our manufacturing sites is evaluated regularly with respect to a broad range of Environmental, Health, and Safety criteria.  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Research and Development  In 2022, we made significant investments in research and development as we worked to develop therapies that we believe have the potential to change the practice of medicine.  Research and development spending increased 5% year over year, representing 18% of 2022 sales.  This increase was primarily the result of significant investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs, including an increase in clinical research for our mitral and tricuspid therapies.  We are engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety, and reliability of our current leading products, and to expand the applications of our products as appropriate.  We focus on opportunities within specific areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring.  A considerable portion of our research and development investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions, and required post-market approval studies involving applications of our products.  Our investment in clinical studies also includes outcomes and cost-effectiveness data for payers, clinicians, and healthcare systems.  In Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, we are developing new products to further improve and streamline transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement procedures.   In Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies, we are making significant investments in innovation and clinical evidence to develop technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases.  In addition to our internally developed programs, we have made investments in several companies that are independently developing minimally-invasive technologies to treat structural heart diseases.  Our Surgical Structural Heart development programs include innovative platforms for patients who are best treated surgically, specifically active patients and patients with more complex combined procedures.   In our Critical Care product line, we are pursuing the development of a variety of decision support solutions for our clinicians.\u00a0 This includes next-generation noninvasive and minimally-invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems, and a next-generation monitor platform.\u00a0 We are also developing a decision support software suite with advanced algorithms for proactive hemodynamic management, including a semi-closed loop system for standardized management of patient fluid levels. Lastly, we are developing a connectivity platform that will offer clinicians additional clinical support, remote monitoring capability, analytics, and insights for their patients\u2019 hemodynamic status.  Our research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the United States and Israel. Our experienced research and development staff are focused on product design and development, quality, clinical research, and regulatory compliance. To pursue primary research efforts, we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities, and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products.  Proprietary Technology  Patents, trademarks, and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing innovations, licensing opportunities, and non-disclosure agreements to develop and maintain our competitive position.  We own or have rights to a substantial number of patents and have patent applications pending both in the United States and in foreign countries. We continue to innovate and file new patent applications to protect our new products and technologies.  Additionally, we are a party to license agreements with various third parties pursuant to which we have obtained, for varying terms, the exclusive or non-exclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for cross-licensing rights and/or royalty payments. We have also licensed certain patent rights to others.  We undertake reasonable measures to protect our patent rights, including monitoring the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our patents. Litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us, and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents.  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Moreover, we own certain United States registered trademarks used in our business. Many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so.  Government Regulation and Other Matters  Our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA, European Union member states competent authorities, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products.   We are also governed by federal, state, local, and international laws of general applicability, including, but not limited to, those regulating employee health and safety, labor, competition, trade secret, and the protection of the environment. Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time.  Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date, but new regulations or amendments to existing regulations to make them more stringent could have such an effect in the future.  We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business.  United States Regulation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the United States, the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices. The FDA regulates design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, and record keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements. The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy, and costly. FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products. A number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets. Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other regulatory standards. Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may impose restrictions or require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.  The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement, or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative. The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements. The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards, or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval, and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution. Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review. Moreover, the FDA and several other United States agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the United States and the import of medical devices into the United States, which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance.  We are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations, products, and technologies, including:  \u2022federal, state, and foreign anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit payments to anyone, including physicians as an inducement to purchase or recommend a product;  \u2022the Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician's immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider;  \u2022federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information, in particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996;  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents  \u2022the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of United States physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers, including medical device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies;  \u2022the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program, and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payor; and  \u2022the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which can be used to prosecute United States companies for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties, or for not keeping accurate financial records or maintaining adequate internal controls to prevent and detect arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties.   Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity, and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities. To assist in our compliance efforts, we work to adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our business activities in the United States and other countries in which we operate. In addition, we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies.  Regulation Outside of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside of the United States, the regulation of medical devices is complex. In Europe, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. The regulatory regime in the European Union (\"EU\") for medical devices became mandatory in June 1998. It requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained, and used in accordance with their intended purpose. National laws conforming to the EU's legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system. Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions. The EU medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark. Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body. In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities.  In May 2017, the EU implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the Medical Device Regulation (\"MDR\").  The MDR became effective on May 26, 2021 and brought significant new requirements for many medical devices, including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation, increased focus on device identification and traceability, new definitions and registration of economic operators throughout the distribution chain, and additional post-market surveillance and vigilance.  Compliance with the MDR requires re-certification of many of our products to the enhanced standards, and has resulted in and will continue to result in substantial additional expense.  In addition, in the EU, we import some of our devices through our offices in Switzerland.  Switzerland is not a member state of the EU, but is linked to the EU through bilateral treaties; therefore, the free movement of goods, including medical devices, between the EU and Switzerland after implementation of the MDR requires a revised Mutual Recognition Agreement (\"MRA\").  If an MRA covering the MDR is not put in place, then non-EU manufacturers may be required to make significant changes, including replacement of Swiss economic operators with operators based in EU member states, and changes will need to be made to our device labeling and/or packaging to satisfy MDR requirements.  If these measures are unable to be taken, it may no longer be possible to place such devices on the EU market.  In Japan, pre-market approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices. Clinical studies are subject to a stringent Japanese \"Good Clinical Practices\" standard. Approval time frames from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years, depending on the complexity and risk level of the device. In addition, importation of medical devices into Japan is subject to the \"Good Import Practices\" regulations. As with any highly regulated market, significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales.  In many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products, we may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things:  \u2022product standards and specifications;  \u2022packaging requirements; 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents   \u2022labeling requirements;  \u2022product collection and disposal requirements;  \u2022quality system requirements;  \u2022import restrictions;  \u2022tariffs;  \u2022duties; and  \u2022tax requirements.  Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. In some regions, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs. In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.  Health Care Initiatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews, technology assessments, increasing evidentiary demands, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States, Europe, and Japan. As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. For example, government programs, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payors require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients. These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.  The delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services. Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare. HHS' Centers for Medicare\u00a0& Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for Medicare beneficiaries. Changes in current coverage and reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility.  The CMS National Coverage Determination for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement was issued in June 2019.\u00a0 The modernized requirements and more streamlined patient evaluation process are meaningful enhancements that may help ensure equitable access for more patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis.  Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power. The medical technology industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past. These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may have a material impact on product pricing.  These laws or any future legislation, including deficit reduction legislation, could impact medical procedure volumes, reimbursement for our products, and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products.  Seasonality  Our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors. Net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures.  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Human Capital Management Strategy  Human Capital Management (\"HCM\") Governance  The primary goals of our talent management strategy are to attract and maintain a motivated, professional workforce and to ensure alignment on our patient-focused innovation strategy.  Our Board of Directors routinely engages with leadership to review and discuss our human capital management (\"HCM\"), with time dedicated at each regularly scheduled meeting to discuss talent management, which include topics such as talent strategy, diversity, succession planning, employee development, employee health, safety, and welfare, results of employee surveys, and compensation.  Our Board of Directors also annually approves the strategic talent imperatives that are tied to our Key Operating Drivers (\"KODs\").  Our KODs are tracked using a point system across our entire organization that focus the Company and management toward short-, medium-, and long-term goals.  The strategic talent imperatives are developed to identify talent related initiatives that support achievement of the KODs.    In addition, the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and his leadership team have talent management related performance goals tied to their compensation; these Performance Management Objectives are reviewed on an annual basis, tracked, and then reported to and evaluated by our Board of Directors.  As we scale to reach more patients around the world, we have integrated our Talent & Organization (\u201cT&O\u201d) Strategy with our Edwards Strategic Planning process. The purpose of our T&O Strategy is to anticipate dynamic global trends related to our workforce, develop our talent to meet future organizational needs, and enable us to be well-poised to meet these needs. Our T&O Strategy enables us to explore external workforce signals, share insights, and identify and build emerging capabilities across our organization. This has enabled us to build a comprehensive succession planning process that allows us to build strong talent from within while we pursue an aggressive recruiting process to fill any gaps with highly qualified external talent. This consistent and scalable approach looks across all our product groups, regions, and significant functions to align and elevate priorities, critical capabilities, and organizational evolutions in line with our strategic plan.  This integrated approach informs our yearly objectives and fuels our talent roadmap across the strategic horizon.  Our HCM governance includes a global talent development review (\"TDR\") process to align our business strategy with talent strategies, assess talent against future organizational needs, evaluate critical talent populations, and enhance the strength of our succession planning.  We track our performance regularly.  Culture  Investing in our workforce means our employees can stay focused on our patient-focused innovation strategy and the development of life-saving therapies for the patients we serve.  We are committed to maintaining an ethical culture where we celebrate diversity, promote good health and safety, empower employees to speak up, and ensure that employees' voices are heard.  We strive to offer competitive employee well-being packages and are committed to fair and equitable pay practices.  We track compensation patterns in all geographies where we operate, and we regularly look for ways to ensure fair and equitable pay.  Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging  We are committed to fostering an environment where all employees can grow and thrive.  A diverse workforce results in a broader range of perspectives, helping drive our commitment to innovation.  We have established a Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging strategy that includes our four focus areas of Business, People, Communication, and Community, and whose overriding priority is \"The Patient.\"  As a practice, all employees receive unconscious bias training as a foundational aspect of our culture.  Employee Listening  We believe in empowering our employees and providing avenues that enable their voices to be heard.  We conduct a multilingual global employee survey, called myVoice, to gain employees' feedback in a confidential manner.  The CEO and Executive Leadership Team hold themselves accountable to act on the results of the survey, and these results are reviewed by management with our Board of Directors.  This initiative helps us gain insights on various topics including patient focus, diversity, inclusion and belonging, quality, innovation, engagement, as well as a sense of support at all levels of the organization.  Speak-Up is a resource available to all employees to bring forth compliance related concerns; a key element of our compliance program is that each employee is accountable for maintaining ethical business practices.  In addition, during each quarterly townhall meeting, our CEO answers questions that have been submitted to him by employees.  Answers to questions that are not covered in the townhall meeting are posted online internally.   10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents   Total Well-being  We understand that good health leads to better performance.  We offer competitive employee well-being packages that include, among other things, health and wellness insurance, health savings accounts, family support services, and a variety of site-specific programs.  We regularly evaluate our well-being package to make modifications that are aligned with the competitive landscape, legislative changes, and the unique needs of our population.  We also provide robust well-being programs that address prevention, nutrition, mental health, physical activity, financial fitness, and community service.  In recent years, mental well-being has become a central topic for organizations worldwide.  As part of our regular evaluation and commitment to putting employees first, we launched a new program, Mind+, which offers a wide variety of mental well-being programs for our employees. This commitment extends to creating a work environment where employees can feel confident speaking about mental well-being with their managers and know how best to access the tools and resources available to support them.  We believe there are strong benefits when employees are feeling their best. Employees who are mentally healthy are more innovative, resilient, better decision-makers, and able to build stronger relationships. We also believe that prioritizing and promoting Mind+ allows us to help patients around the world to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives and supports employees to be their best self at home and at work.  Talent Development  Edwards has established a long-term aspiration to grow and develop talent significantly, centering our efforts around critical leadership and technical skills for the present and future needs of the business.  Our learning and development structure and processes strive to meet the internal demand to develop our talent in such a way that demonstrates impact at scale and delivered to our workforce through optimized learning modalities.  This includes leadership training programs, including our ethical decision making training program for managers.  Headcount and Labor Representation  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 17,300 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located in the United States, Singapore, the Dominican Republic, and Costa Rica. None of our North American employees are represented by a labor union. In various countries outside of North America, we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent employees.
