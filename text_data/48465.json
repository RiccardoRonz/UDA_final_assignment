Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, as Geo. A. Hormel\u00a0& Company. The Company started as a processor of meat and food products and continues in this line of business with emphasis on the manufacturing and distribution of branded, value-added consumer items rather than commodity fresh meat products. The Company builds on its founder's legacy of innovation, quality, and integrity with focus on its purpose statement \u2014 Inspired People. Inspired Food.\u2122 Today, the Company is a global branded food company bringing some of the most trusted and iconic brands to tables across the globe with over $12 billion in annual revenue in more than 80 countries.  The Company has continually expanded its product portfolio through organic growth and acquisitions. In fiscal 2021, the Company acquired the Planters\u00ae snack nuts business, expanding the Company's presence in the growing snacking space. Refer to Note B - Acquisitions and Divestitures of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2023, the Company purchased a 30% common stock interest in PT Garudafood Putra Putri Jaya Tbk (Garudafood), a food and beverage company in Indonesia, expanding the Company's presence in Southeast Asia and supporting global execution in the snacking and entertaining category. Refer to Note D - Investments in Affiliates of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   Description of Business  Segments Effective in fiscal 2023, the Company transitioned to a new strategic operating model, which aligns its businesses to be more agile, consumer and customer focused, and market driven. The Company currently operates with the following three operating and reportable segments: Retail, Foodservice, and International.  Retail The Retail segment consists primarily of the processing, marketing, and sale of food products sold predominantly in the retail market. This segment also includes the results from the Company\u2019s MegaMex Foods, LLC joint venture.  Foodservice The Foodservice segment consists primarily of the processing, marketing, and sale of food and nutritional products for foodservice, convenience store, and commercial customers.  International The International segment processes, markets, and sells Company products internationally. This segment also includes the results from the Company\u2019s international joint ventures, equity method investments, and royalty arrangements.  Prior period results for fiscal 2022 and 2021 have been recast to reflect the new reportable segments. Net sales to unaffiliated customers, segment profit, and certain other financial information by segment are reported in Note P - Segment Reporting of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Products and Distribution The Company develops, processes, and distributes a wide array of food products in a variety of markets and manufactures its products through various processing facilities and trusted co-manufacturers. The Company\u2019s products primarily consist of meat, nuts, and other food products sold across multiple distribution channels, such as U.S. Retail, U.S. Foodservice, and International.  Domestically, the Company sells its products in all 50 states. The Company\u2019s products are sold through its sales personnel, who operate in assigned territories or in dedicated teams serving major customers and who are coordinated from sales offices predominately located in major U.S. cities. The Company also utilizes independent brokers and distributors. Products are primarily distributed by common carrier.  The Company has a global presence within several major international markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea. Distribution of export sales to customers is by common carrier, while the China and Brazil operations own and operate their own delivery systems. The Company has licensed companies to manufacture various products internationally on a royalty basis, with the primary licensees being Danish Crown UK  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Ltd., and CJ CheilJedang Corporation. The Company also has minority positions in food companies in the Philippines (The Purefoods-Hormel Company,\u00a0Inc., 40 percent holding) and Indonesia (Garudafood, 30 percent holding).  Raw Materials The Company concentrates on the marketing and sale of branded, value-added food products. The principal raw materials used by the Company include pork, turkey, beef, chicken, and nuts. The Company takes a balanced approach to sourcing pork raw materials, including hogs purchased for the Austin, Minnesota processing facility, long-term supply agreements for pork, and spot market purchases of pork. The majority of the turkeys needed to meet raw material requirements are raised by the Company. Production costs from raising turkeys are subject to fluctuations in grain prices and fuel costs. To manage these risks, the Company uses futures, swaps, and options contracts to hedge a portion of its anticipated purchases.   The Company also purchases raw materials from various suppliers. As the Company has shifted its focus toward a more value-added portfolio, it has become increasingly dependent on these suppliers to meet its raw material needs. Certain raw materials, such as cashews, are sourced internationally, which may cause additional risks to pricing and availability. The Company utilizes supply contracts and forward buying strategies to ensure an adequate supply and mitigate price fluctuations.   Human Capital The Company\u2019s employees are the driving force behind innovation, improvement, and success. As of October 29, 2023, the Company had approximately 20,000 active employees, with over 90 percent located within the U.S. Approximately 20 percent of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.   Talent Acquisition, Development, and Retention Hormel\u2019s team members are the cornerstone of the Company and of the fulfillment of its purpose \u2014 Inspired People. Inspired Food.\u2122 The Company places great importance on the growth, development, and engagement of its team members. The Company offers a competitive compensation package and a multitude of benefits, including medical, life and disability insurance, contributory and non-contributory retirement savings plans, free post-secondary tuition and tuition reimbursement programs, and two years of tuition-free community and technical college for U.S. employees\u2019 dependent children.  The Company believes investing in the education, training, and development of employees contributes to the overall success of the business. The Company provides learning opportunities for employees through various training courses, including instructor-led internal and external programs and on-the-job training.  The Company considers the tenure of its team members to be an important indicator of overall performance and is proud of its tenure figures. As of October 29, 2023, approximately 50 percent of the Company's team members had five or more years of service, and the 34-person officer team had an average of 25 years of service.  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion The Company welcomes the diversity of all team members, customers, and consumers, and encourages the integration of their unique skills, thoughts, experiences, and identities. The Company\u2019s workforce is made up of approximately 40 percent female and approximately 60 percent underrepresented minorities. The Company\u2019s salaried employees are made up of approximately 35 percent female and over 20 percent underrepresented minorities. By fostering an inclusive culture, the Company enables every member of the workforce to leverage unique talents and high performance standards to drive innovation and success.  Executives of the Company are held accountable for creating an inclusive, diverse workplace through their annual incentive plan, which includes a component focused on overall belonging scores and the representation of female and underrepresented minorities in salaried positions.   The Company supports twelve employee resource groups (ERGs) that support the Company\u2019s mission to create a workplace where all people feel welcomed, respected, and valued. These employee-driven groups play a critical role in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and provide professional development and mentorship opportunities.   Safety, Health, and Wellness The Company\u2019s dedicated corporate safety department develops and administers company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each employee and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. The corporate safety department also conducts regular audits of production facilities to ensure compliance with Company safety policies. The Company conducts safety training for all team members and completes approximately 1,000 safety assessments each month.  The Company recognizes that team members perform best when they are healthy, and that optimal performance is necessary for the Company to achieve its key results. In addition to the health care benefits package, the Company\u2019s Inspired Health program aims to cultivate and maintain a culture of health and wellness that is focused on encouraging and empowering team members to make healthy lifestyle choices through awareness, prevention, and positive health behavior  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents  changes. This program includes biometric screenings, on-site fitness centers and fitness center discounts, an online health university with robust information and resources, a tobacco cessation program, wellness challenges, and confidential health and wellness support.  Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters The Company\u2019s operations are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies which oversee areas such as food safety, workforce immigration, environmental laws, animal welfare, tax regulations, and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of the Company\u2019s products. The Company believes it is in compliance with current laws and regulations and does not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company continues to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and, while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect compliance to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In addition to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, the Company sets goals to further improve its sustainability efforts and reduce its environmental impact. These goals are outlined in the Company\u2019s 20 by 30 Challenge and include matching energy with renewable sourcing, reducing organic waste and greenhouse gas emissions, supporting regenerative agriculture, focusing on packaging sustainability, and reducing food waste. In addition, the Company's greenhouse gas reduction targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative in 2023.  Significant Customers The Company serves many customers throughout the world across various sales channels. Sales to the Company\u2019s largest customer, Walmart Inc. (Walmart), accounted for approximately 15 percent of consolidated gross sales less returns and allowances during fiscal 2023. Walmart is a customer for the Company's Retail and International segments. The Company\u2019s top five customers collectively represent approximately 36 percent of consolidated gross sales less returns and allowances. The loss of one or more of the top customers in any of the reportable segments could have a material adverse effect upon such segment\u2019s financial results.  Competition The production and sale of meat and food products in the U.S. and internationally is highly competitive. The Company competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products as well as national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources, such as beef, chicken, fish, nuts, and plant-based proteins.  All operating segments compete on the basis of price, product quality and attributes, brand identification, breadth of product line, and customer service. Through effective marketing and strong quality assurance programs, the Company\u2019s strategy is to provide high quality products that possess strong brand recognition, which support higher value perceptions with customers. To grow and maintain market position, the Company focuses on meeting consumer preferences, delivering product innovation, and maintaining long-term and lasting relationships with industry partners.
