{"cik": 789570, "item_1A": "ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS  MGM Resorts International is referred to as the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cMGM Resorts,\u201d or the \u201cRegistrant,\u201d and together with its subsidiaries may also be referred to as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as \u201cMGM China.\u201d Except where the context indicates otherwise, \u201cMGP\u201d refers to MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its consolidated subsidiaries.  Overview  MGM Resorts International is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1986 that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, is a global gaming and entertainment company with domestic and international locations featuring best-in-class hotels and casinos, state-of-the-art meeting and conference spaces, incredible live and theatrical entertainment experiences, and an extensive array of restaurant, nightlife and retail offerings, and sports betting and online gaming operations.   We believe we operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests. We also believe that through our online gaming operations, we can create a scaled global online gaming business.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we operate 17 domestic casino resorts and, through our 56% controlling interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries, \u201cMGM China\u201d), which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (\u201cMGM Grand Paradise\u201d), operate two casino resorts in Macau. We also have global online gaming operations through our consolidated subsidiary LeoVegas AB (\u201cLeoVegas\u201d) and our unconsolidated 50% owned venture, BetMGM, LLC (\u201cBetMGM\u201d).  We lease the real estate assets of our domestic resorts pursuant to triple-net lease agreements, as further discussed in Note 11. Prior to the closing of the VICI Transaction (defined below), MGM Growth Properties LLC (\u201cMGP\u201d), was a consolidated subsidiary of ours and, through its subsidiary MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (\u201cMGP OP\u201d), was the landlord of certain of our domestic properties pursuant to an intercompany master lease arrangement.   Business Developments   In recent years, in furtherance of our vision to be the world\u2019s premier gaming entertainment company, we have implemented an asset-light business model, which has involved a comprehensive review of our owned real estate assets to find opportunities to monetize those assets efficiently and allow unlocked capital to be redeployed towards balance sheet improvements, new growth opportunities, and to return value to our shareholders. At the same time, we have continued to focus on key growth opportunities that align with our vision, particularly by investing in U.S. online sports betting and iGaming through BetMGM, acquiring LeoVegas to expand our global online presence, expanding our digital capabilities, and seeking to diversify our Asia operations with development efforts in Japan.  As part of that business strategy, we have sought and executed on opportunities to invest in our growth areas, divest our real estate assets, and acquire, or enter into venture transactions, with respect to online gaming and the operations of integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts, including through the following transactions:  \u2022In July 2018, we and Entain plc (\u201cEntain\u201d) formed BetMGM. In connection with its formation, we provided BetMGM with exclusive access to all of our domestic land based and online sports betting, major tournament poker, and online gaming operations and Entain provided BetMGM with exclusive access to its technology in the United States.  \u2022In January 2019, we acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City Casino's racetrack and casino (\u201cEmpire City\u201d) for total consideration of approximately $865 million. Subsequently, MGP acquired Empire City\u2019s developed real property from us and Empire City was added to the master lease with MGP.  \u2022In March 2019, we entered into an amendment to the master lease with MGP with respect to improvements made by us related to the rebranding of the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property. 1 1 1    \u2022In November 2019, the venture that is 5% owned by a subsidiary of ours and 95% owned by a subsidiary of Blackstone Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (\u201cBREIT\u201d, such venture, the \u201cBellagio BREIT Venture\u201d) was formed, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from us for total consideration of $4.25 billion, and leased such assets back to us pursuant to a lease agreement. Refer to Note 11 for additional information relating to the lease and Note 12 for the guarantee entered into in connection with the transaction.  \u2022In December 2019, we completed the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land for $825 million.   \u2022On February 14, 2020, we completed a series of transactions (collectively the \u201cMGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay transaction\u201d) pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to the newly formed venture that was 50.1% owned by a subsidiary of MGP OP and 49.9% by a subsidiary of BREIT (such venture, the \u201cVICI BREIT Venture\u201d) in exchange for total consideration of $4.6 billion. See Note 1 for further discussion on the transaction and Note 12 for the guarantee entered into in connection with the transaction.  \u2022In connection with the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay transaction, VICI BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. Additionally, the master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property.  \u2022Also, on January 14, 2020, we, MGP OP, and MGP entered into a waiver agreement pursuant to which approximately 30 million MGP OP units that we held were redeemed for $700 million on May 18, 2020 and approximately 24 million MGP OP units that we held were redeemed for $700 million on December 2, 2020. As a result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms. Refer to Note 1 for further information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.   \u2022On March 4, 2021, we delivered a notice of redemption to MGP covering approximately 37 million MGP OP units that we held which was satisfied with aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, using cash on hand together with the proceeds from MGP\u2019s issuance of Class A shares. See Note 13 for information regarding this transaction, which eliminated in consolidation.  \u2022On September 27, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining  50% ownership interest in CityCenter Holdings, LLC (\u201cCityCenter\u201d)  for cash consideration of $2.125 billion. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on this acquisition.  \u2022On September 28, 2021, we sold the real estate assets of Aria and Vdara to funds managed by The Blackstone Group Inc. (\u201cBlackstone\u201d) for cash consideration of $3.89 billion and entered into a lease through which the real property is leased back to a subsidiary of ours. Refer to Note 11 for discussion of the lease agreement.  \u2022On September 28, 2021, we announced that we, together with our venture partner, ORIX Corporation (\u201cORIX\u201d), were selected by Osaka as the region\u2019s integrated resort partner. In December 2021, we and ORIX formed a venture, through which we bid to develop one of Japan's first integrated resorts. On April 27, 2022, we, together with Osaka prefecture/city and our partners at ORIX, submitted an Area Development Plan to Japan\u2019s central government.  \u2022On October 29, 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from us for cash consideration of $400 million and MGM Springfield was added to the master lease with MGP. Transactions with MGP, including transactions under the master lease with MGP, have been eliminated in our consolidation of MGP.   \u2022On April 29, 2022, we completed a series of transactions with VICI Properties, Inc. (\u201cVICI\u201d) and MGP whereby VICI acquired MGP in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the \u201cVICI Transaction\u201d). MGP Class A shareholders received 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and we received 1.366 units of VICI Properties OP LLC (\u201cVICI OP\u201d) in exchange for each MGP OP unit held by us. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP redeemed the majority of our VICI OP units, with us retaining an approximate 1% ownership interest in VICI OP. MGP\u2019s Class B share that was held by us was cancelled. We no longer hold a controlling interest in MGP and deconsolidated MGP upon the closing of the  VICI Transaction. Refer to Note 4 for further discussion of the VICI Transactions. In connection with the VICI Transaction, we entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the lease.  2 2 2   \u2022On May 17, 2022, we acquired the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas (\u201cThe Cosmopolitan\u201d) for cash consideration of $1.625\u00a0billion, plus working capital adjustments for a total purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion. Additionally, we entered into a lease agreement for the real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. See Note 4 and Note 11 for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively.  \u2022On September 7, 2022, we acquired LeoVegas through a tender offer at a cash price of SEK 61 per share, for a total fair value of equity interests acquired of approximately $556 million, inclusive of cash settlement of equity awards. See Note 4 for discussion of this transaction.  \u2022On December 16, 2022, we were awarded a new gaming concession, which permits the operation of games of chance or other games in casinos in Macau, commencing on January 1, 2023.   \u2022On December 19, 2022, we completed the sale of the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment, Inc.

At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove The Mirage and reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 4 for further discussion of this transaction.  \u2022On February 15, 2023, we completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE Gaming Holdings, LLC (\u201cCNE\u201d), a subsidiary of Cherokee Nation Business, for cash consideration of $450 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d as well as the notes to our consolidated financial statements specified above.  Impact of COVID-19. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Description of our business and key performance indicators \u2014 Impact of COVID-19\u201d for more information about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our recovery. For a discussion of the risks to our business resulting from COVID-19, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions.\u201d  Resort Operations   General   Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments, and repay debt financings.  Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts, except as otherwise described related to the impact of COVID-19, typically operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Empire City, which operates 20 hours a day, every day of the year, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the timing of entertainment and sports events, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. Our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We also lease space to third-party retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we have three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China, as generally described below. See Note 17 for detailed financial information about our reportable segments.  Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations Las Vegas Strip Resorts. Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts: Aria (including Vdara) (upon its acquisition in September 2021), Bellagio, The Cosmopolitan (upon its acquisition in May 2022), MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage (until its  3 3 3   disposition in December 2022), Luxor, New York-New York (including The Park), Excalibur, and Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas). Regional Operations. Regional Operations consists of the following casino resorts: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi (until its disposition in February 2023); Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland; MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York; and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio.  Over half of the net revenue from our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is typically derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities and the majority of the net revenue from our Regional Operations is typically derived from gaming operations. Our long-term strategy continues to be to market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes, which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.  Our casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games. In addition, we provide our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere.   MGM China  We own approximately 56% of MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and holds the related gaming concession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Although visitation during 2020, 2021, and 2022 was significantly reduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the long-term future growth of the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.  Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China\u2019s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations, which are conducted under a gaming concession held by MGM Grand Paradise, a subsidiary of MGM China. Gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to six different concessionaires.   Corporate and Other   We have additional business activities including LeoVegas, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including BetMGM, and certain other corporate and management operations.   Customers and Competition   Our properties operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, iGaming and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions \u2014 We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d  Our primary methods of successful competition include: \u2022Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets; \u2022Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities; \u2022Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service; \u2022Providing unique, \u201cmust-see\u201d entertainment attractions;  \u2022Investing in digital offerings and opportunities domestically and abroad; and \u2022Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.  4 4 4   Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations  Our customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings. We have a diverse portfolio of properties, which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our properties have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our properties during midweek and off-peak periods.  Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity and convention space offerings, or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.  Outside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region.   MGM China  The Macau gaming market has historically had three primary customer bases: VIP gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. VIP gaming at MGM China is conducted through the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the amount of wagering conducted to determine VIP gaming play. VIP commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. Main floor players do not receive commissions. We have focused our business on main floor gaming operations and, accordingly, VIP gaming operations were not a significant source of revenue in 2022 and we do not expect VIP gaming operations to be a significant source of revenue in future years. The majority of MGM China's casino revenue has been provided by main floor gaming operations in recent years and we expect this customer base will be the primary source of growth in the future. We offer amenities to attract players such as premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for premium main floor players\u2019 use, as well as non-gaming amenities, such as The Mansion and MGM Cotai Emerald Villa to attract ultra-high end customers.  In December 2021, we suspended operations with our primary gaming promoters indefinitely. Prior to December 2021, we had externally sourced VIP gaming play through external gaming promoters who assisted VIP players with their travel and entertainment arrangements. Gaming promoters purchased special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips and, in turn, they sold these chips to their players. Gaming promoters were compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements based on a percentage of the gross table games win and through payment of a percentage of rolling chip turnover. They also received an allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generated, which could be applied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary customer-related expenses. Gaming promoter commissions were recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.   Our key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires. We also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world including, but not limited to, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Australia, and Las Vegas.   Marketing  Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting customer relationships.   MGM Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both gaming and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. As members advance through tiers, a host of member benefits are unlocked including priority access, exclusive events and experiences, and the opportunity to redeem MGM Rewards for hotel stays, food and beverage,  5 5 5   and other MGM Resorts experiences. We also offer the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused customers, in addition to M life Rewards, at MGM China. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resorts provide. Our loyalty programs focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers, encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend.  Strategy   We strive to be a leader in the global gaming, entertainment and hospitality industry that delivers extraordinary entertainment across a portfolio of properties in the United States and Macau. The quality of our properties and amenities is evidenced by our success in winning numerous awards, both domestic and globally, including several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association, multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide and numerous certifications of our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.  In order to achieve our vision of becoming the world's premier gaming entertainment company, we developed our strategic plan, which centers on five pillars:   \u2022Strong People and Culture. Recruit, develop and retain the best talent. Foster a culture of diversity and inclusion. Invest in the employee experience.  \u2022Customer-Centric Model. Leverage a customer-centric model reinforced by a strong brand and deep customer insights to provide unmatched entertainment experiences for our guests and drive top-line growth. \u2022Operational Excellence. Operating model refinement to diversify business mix, maximize operating efficiencies and expand margins. Enhancement of digital capabilities to strengthen customer loyalty.  \u2022Disciplined Capital Allocation to Maximize Shareholder Value. Pursuit of targeted, attractive ROI opportunities that align to our strategic vision. Focus on shareholder returns. Fortify balance sheet.  \u2022Gaming Entertainment. Innovate our gaming entertainment product to drive continued premium positioning and competitive differentiation. Distribute our product offering to serve the broadest total addressable market possible.  The strategic plan was developed with the intent to regularly revisit, measure, and reevaluate for emerging opportunities.  In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investments in our existing properties, strategic growth opportunities, debt repayment and shareholder returns. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns.  We regularly evaluate targeted opportunities that provide an attractive return on investment in domestic and international markets, including the ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for iGaming and online sports betting, including our acquisition of LeoVegas. We also leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities.   We continue to maximize the benefits of our operating model by driving optimization of our Centers of Excellence and enabling best in class operations through adjustments within corporate and property business units. In addition, we have implemented several improvement and cost cutting initiatives comprised of labor, sourcing, and revenue programs that have further improved our operating model and have positioned us as a stronger company.  We have continued to focus on our key growth opportunities of developing an integrated resort in Japan, investing in BetMGM, investing in international digital opportunities through our acquisition of LeoVegas, and exploring a full-scale commercial gaming opportunity in New York. In September 2021, we, together with our venture partner, ORIX, were selected by Osaka as the region\u2019s integrated resort partner. This selection marks an important step in our long-term bid to develop one of Japan\u2019s first integrated casino resorts. In April 2022, we submitted an area development plan to the central government and are currently awaiting a decision. As it relates to BetMGM, we believe that BetMGM is positioned as a long-term leader in the U.S. online sports betting and iGaming industries. As part of our commitment to the success of BetMGM, we have integrated our MGM Rewards program with BetMGM and have BetMGM branded on-property sportsbooks and kiosks to drive higher value customers at lower acquisition costs through a robust omni-channel strategy. Further, we continue to explore bringing full-scale commercial gaming to Empire City in New York. In January 2023, a request for application for three downstate commercial gaming licenses was released, to which we expect to respond.  Technology  We believe technology, digital and advanced data science/analytics capabilities are critical to optimizing customer experience and loyalty, employee productivity and engagement, operational efficiency and revenue growth. We are focused on using these capabilities to achieve specific goals of creating \u2018only at MGM\u2019 differentiation through unique content and  6 6 6   experiences, establishing a perennial engagement with our guests for increased loyalty, digital diversification through enhanced e-commerce and seamless integration of the physical integrated resorts business with digital casino and sports betting businesses, creating cross-property experiences and promotions in Las Vegas to provide much better value to the consumer, enhancing our data driven decisioning capabilities in all aspects of our business for faster decision making, and optimizing our operations and employee productivity and experience through digitization. Additionally, this year we have deployed a new loyalty technology platform that allows customers to earn points through gaming and non-gaming activities, and we have enabled bundling technology capabilities to sell packages customized to a customer segment.    Environmental Sustainability   At MGM Resorts, we have had a long-standing commitment to environmental and social responsibility. For over a decade, we have had a dedicated board committee focused on Corporate Social Responsibility (\u201cCSR\u201d). In 2019, we had bolstered governance of these areas by uniting our key pillars of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Philanthropy and Community Engagement and Environmental Sustainability under one Executive Committee-level leader who manages the MGM Resorts Social Impact and Sustainability Center of Excellence, reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and serves as liaison to the CSR and Sustainability board committee. This leader also oversees the Human Resources function, and is thus able to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) considerations more deeply into the core culture of our organization through proactive management of our human and social capital initiatives.   ESG Reporting  Throughout 2022, we continued our progress on key ESG initiatives and enhanced our disclosures, supporting our commitment to MGM\u2019s Focused on What Matters platform and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our most recent Social Impact & Sustainability Report built on the robust disclosures of 2021 to illustrate progress across our public social impact and sustainability goals, and we expect to publish a new report in 2023 detailing progress made in 2022.  Our reporting in 2022 contributed to the growing list of disclosures and frameworks to which we align with our first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report (published in May 2022). This report adds to our work to publish disclosures aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Hotels & Lodging and Casinos & Gaming Sector Standards. As our catalog of reports aligned to leading ESG frameworks has grown, we have updated our website to efficiently present these disclosures and policies at mgmresorts.com/esg. The content on this website is for informational purposes only and such content is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Energy & Carbon  The year ended December 31, 2022 was the first full calendar year of operation for our Mega Solar Array (\u201cMega Array\u201d) which, on average, has met or exceeded our production expectations. We believe that the solar energy produced by the Mega Array will play a key role in meeting our climate goals:  \u202245% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions intensity (pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot; 2007 baseline) by 2025; \u202250% reduction in absolute Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions  (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; 2019 baseline) by 2030; and \u2022100% renewable electricity purchased in U.S. and 80% purchased globally by 2030.  In addition, we have committed to reduce its value chain emissions with a goal to reduce carbon emissions across our significant Scope 3 categories by 30% by 2030.  Water  We are committed to using water responsibly across our operations and supply chain and we aim to drive long-term water efficiency by optimizing water systems and implementing water conservation measures. In 2022, we developed a global water policy to codify our commitment to water stewardship and a strategic framework for addressing water use. In addition, we enhanced our water-related disclosures by participating in the 2022 CDP Water Security Questionnaire and achieved an \u201cA\u201d, CDP\u2019s highest score.  Trademarks  Our principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for, among others, Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, The Cosmopolitan, Borgata, Mandalay Bay, MGM, MGM Grand, MGM Resorts International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Beau Rivage, Empire City, and LeoVegas, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United States and Europe, as applicable. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks, such as The Mirage, in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects in the United States  7 7 7   and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights.   Human Capital   We are focused on fostering a people-driven culture exemplified by how we lead and uphold the following core values: Captivate Our Audience, Inspire Excellence, Champion Inclusion, and Win Together, to create an engaged and diverse workforce. Our long-term people strategy is designed to enhance talent attraction and development to support business objectives, guest experience, community engagement, and financial goals. Our workforce development strategies support local hiring and developing a robust workforce in the local communities in which we operate through veteran support, community training and employment, fulfilling local hiring commitments (where applicable), and through internship and management development programs. In response to labor demands and agile staffing requirements, we have significantly streamlined our recruitment processes for faster sourcing and recruitment to meet business and operational needs.   Growth and Development  We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed, now and in the future, to continue to be a premier employer of choice across the gaming, hospitality, and entertainment industries. We are committed to a culture of continuous learning where employees, at all levels, are engaged in developing their knowledge, skills, and abilities and we support the long-term career aspirations of our employees through education and professional/personal development. We continue to introduce new learning and development initiatives focused on a broad range of employee segments. We offer tuition reimbursement, contribute toward student loan debt repayment, and have partnered with the Nevada System of Higher Education to allow employees to earn a degree online free of charge for all credit hours. Over the past year we have introduced several new talent management and development initiatives including a sabbatical program for our director level and above employees and enhanced employee recognition and onboarding programs applicable across all levels.   Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\u201cDE&I\u201d)  Our approach to DE&I is anchored by our corporate and people strategies and a social impact and sustainability approach that centers on embracing humanity. A comprehensive framework lays out four strategic pillars to guide our work: invest in people; build an inclusive culture; grow business and customer engagement and supplier diversity; and enhance marketplace leadership and community relations. As part of our commitment, we have committed to the following four long-range 2025 goals: (1) ensure that all employees have equal access to leadership opportunities, (2) spend at least 10% of our biddable procurement with diverse suppliers, (3) expand our Supplier Diversity Mentorship Program to achieve 150 graduates and (4) train 100% of management employees on social impact and sustainability policies and goals. In connection with each goal, we have established robust key performance indicators, which are tracked and published in our annual Social Impact and Sustainability Report and reviewed internally with management and our CSR & Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors. In addition, we have detailed internal Human Capital workforce reports, which include demographic and diversity data, and are reviewed with the CSR & Sustainability Committee of the Board, executive management, and leadership teams on a regular basis.   Internally, we use multiple channels to facilitate communication and to continuously advance one of our core values, Champion Inclusion. The channels include but are not limited to open forums with executives, employee engagement surveys with detailed action planning, and employee network groups.  Work in the area of diversity, equity, and inclusion is advanced through a range of programs and initiatives which include employee education and training, community partnerships, recruitment and talent development, advocacy, engagement and outreach and through internal groups like our Supplier Diversity and ESG task forces. Responsibility is driven and led by our Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and is supported by a centralized Diversity and Inclusion team and the Human Resources department.  8 8 8   Health, Safety, and Wellness  To promote our culture of overall employee health and wellness we provide benefits, tools and resources to help maintain or improve physical, emotional, and financial health. We continue to align benefit offerings to the needs of a diverse workforce across an expanded regional presence and leverage innovative digital solutions to expand access to health and wellness resources, including the recent launch of the World of Wellbeing (WOW), our holistic approach that focuses on the whole person. In addition, in 2022, we continued to ensure our employees\u2019 continued health, safety, and wellness in response to COVID-19.  Community Engagement and Philanthropy  Our philanthropic focus centers around: Embracing Humanity and Protecting the Planet. We organize our major programs and initiatives under the pillars of caring for one another and investing in our communities. We established the MGM Resorts Foundation in 2002 as an engagement opportunity for employees to contribute to charitable causes, which provides two types of grants (1) the Employee Emergency Grant, which benefits our employees, and (2) the Community Grant, which benefits local communities. We endeavor to care for our communities through volunteerism and philanthropy and encourage all our employees to volunteer through a variety of programs. In addition, we offer opportunities for our employees to give back to their communities, including through programs such as VolunteerREWARDS, which provides employees with opportunities to earn grant money to the non-profit of choice based on volunteer hours.   Employees and Labor Relations  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 46,000 full-time and 18,000 part-time employees domestically. In addition, we had approximately 10,000 and 1,000 employees at MGM China and LeoVegas, respectively. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 38,000 of our employees as of December\u00a031, 2022. Collective bargaining agreements covering multiple bargaining units at our Regional Operations and Las Vegas Strip Resorts are scheduled to expire in 2023. This includes agreements with the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas for eight of our Las Vegas Strip resorts and covering approximately 22,000 bargaining unit employees in Las Vegas; those agreements are scheduled to expire May 31, 2023. Additionally, collective bargaining agreements covering all bargaining units at Beau Rivage in Mississippi, two bargaining units at MGM Grand Detroit, the front services, parking, warehouse and facilities bargaining units at MGM National Harbor, transportation bargaining units in Las Vegas, all bargaining units at MGM Northfield Park, and a number of smaller bargaining units in both Las Vegas and regional resorts are expiring in 2023. Negotiations for successor contracts will be scheduled with our employees\u2019 collective bargaining representatives as contract expiration dates approach and will continue throughout 2023. As of December\u00a031, 2022, none of the employees of MGM China or LeoVegas are part of a labor union and the MGM China resorts and LeoVegas are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.   Government Regulation and Licensing   The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos and our online operations are subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located or operates. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.   A more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.   Our businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes (including regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities), construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.   In addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or  9 9 9   remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations.  For a discussion of potential risks to our business relating to regulatory matters, including due to the potential impact of legislative and regulatory changes, please see \u201cItem 1A.
