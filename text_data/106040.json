We continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity, sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs. For example, we have taken aggressive actions to restructure our client HDD manufacturing footprint in light of ongoing trends in the HDD Client market as PCs shift from using HDD to Flash technology. We continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs. We also leverage contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous.   Our vertically integrated, in-house assembly and test operations for our HDD products are concentrated in Prachinburi and Bang Pa-In, Thailand; Penang, Johor Bahru, and Kuching, Malaysia; Laguna, Philippines; Shenzhen, China; San Jose and Fremont, CA, USA.  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Ventures with Kioxia     Substantially all of our flash-based supply requirements for Flash is obtained from our ventures with Kioxia, which provide us with leading-edge, high-quality and low-cost flash memory wafers. While substantially all of our flash memory supply utilized for our products is purchased from these ventures, from time to time, we also purchase flash memory from other flash manufacturers. While we do not unilaterally control the operations of our ventures with Kioxia, we believe that our business venture relationship with Kioxia helps us reduce product costs, increases our ability to control the quality of our products and speeds delivery of our products to our customers. Our business ventures with Kioxia are located primarily in Yokkaichi and Kitakami, Japan, and our in-house assembly and test operations are located in Shanghai, China and Penang, Malaysia.  We and Kioxia currently operate three business ventures in 300-millimeter flash-based manufacturing facilities in Japan, which provide us leading-edge, cost-competitive flash-based memory wafers for our end products. Through Flash Partners Ltd., Flash Alliance Ltd., and Flash Forward Ltd., which we collectively refer to as Flash Ventures, we and Kioxia collaborate in the development and manufacture of flash-based memory wafers using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by each of the Flash Venture entities. We hold a 49.9% ownership position in each of the Flash Venture entities. Each Flash Venture entity purchases wafers from Kioxia at cost and then resells those wafers to us and Kioxia at cost plus a small markup. We are obligated to take our share of the output from these ventures or pay for variable costs incurred in producing our share of Flash Ventures\u2019 flash-based memory wafer supply, based on our three-month forecast, which generally equals 50% of Flash Ventures\u2019 output. In addition, we are obligated to pay for half of Flash Ventures\u2019 fixed costs regardless of the output we choose to purchase. We are also obligated to fund 49.9% to 50.0% of each Flash Ventures entity\u2019s capital investments to the extent that the Flash Ventures entity\u2019s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments. We co-develop flash technologies (including process technology and memory design) with Kioxia and contribute IP for Flash Ventures\u2019 use.  The agreements governing the operations of the Flash Venture entities also set out a framework for any investment by the joint venture partners in flash manufacturing capacity. Since its inception, Flash Ventures\u2019 primary manufacturing site has been located in Yokkaichi, Japan. The Yokkaichi site, which is owned and operated by Kioxia, currently includes six wafer fabrication facilities. We have jointly invested, and intend to continue to jointly invest, with Kioxia in manufacturing equipment for the Yokkaichi fabrication facilities. We also have agreements that extend Flash Ventures to a wafer fabrication facility located in Kitakami, Japan, referred to as \u201cK1\u201d, which is operated by Kioxia Iwate Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kioxia. In January 2022, we entered into agreements regarding Flash Ventures\u2019 investment in a new wafer fabrication facility in Yokkaichi, Japan, referred to as \u201cY7\u201d, which is the sixth wafer fabrication facility at the Yokkaichi site. The primary purpose of Y7 is to provide clean room space to continue the transition of existing flash-based wafer capacity to newer flash technology nodes. The first phase of construction of Y7 is now complete and has commenced output.

We believe the use of our in-house assembly and test facilities, as well as contract manufacturers, provides flexibility and gives us access to increased production capacity. We have developed deep relationships with these vendors and Kioxia to establish a continuous supply of flash-based memory and controllers.  HDD consists primarily of recording heads, magnetic media, controllers and firmware, and a printed circuit board assembly. We design and manufacture substantially all of the recording heads and magnetic media required for our products. As a result, we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts for these components and less reliant on recording head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers. We depend on an external supply base for all remaining components and materials for use in our HDD product design, manufacturing, and testing. We believe the use of our in-house manufacturing, assembly and test facilities provides the controls necessary to provide the demanding capabilities, performance and reliability our customers require.  We generally retain multiple suppliers for our component requirements, but for business or technology reasons, we source some of our components from a limited number of sole or single source providers.
