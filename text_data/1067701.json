{"cik": 1067701, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business  United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world, operates throughout the United States and Canada, and has a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The table below presents key information about our business as of and for the years ended December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021. Our business is discussed in more detail below. The data below should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, our Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report.  1 1 1 Table of Contents Table of Contents 20222021PERFORMANCE MEASURESTotal revenues (in millions)$11,642$9,716Equipment rental revenue percent of total revenues87%84%Equipment rental revenue variance components:Year-over-year change in average original equipment cost (\u201cOEC\u201d)13.6%4.0%Assumed year-over-year inflation impact (1)(1.5)%(1.5)%Fleet productivity (2) 9.4%10.4%Contribution from ancillary and re-rent revenue (3)1.8%2.0%Total equipment rental revenue variance23.3%14.9%Key account percent of equipment rental revenue68%72%National account percent of equipment rental revenue42%43%FLEETFleet OEC (in billions)$19.61$15.79Equipment classes4,6004,300Equipment units1,020,000780,000Fleet age in months53.554.1Percent of fleet that is current on manufacturer's recommended maintenance77%77%Equipment rental revenue percent by fleet type:General construction and industrial equipment42%42%Aerial work platforms24%26%General tools and light equipment8%8%Power and HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) equipment10%9%Trench safety equipment6%6%Fluid solutions equipment7%7%Mobile storage equipment and modular office space3%2%LOCATIONS/PERSONNELRental locations (4)1,5211,345Approximate range of branches per district4-133-11Approximate range of districts per region6-114-9Range of regions per division2-62-6Hourly employees17,50014,200Salaried employees7,1006,200Total employees (4)24,60020,400INDUSTRYEstimated North American market share (5)17%15%Estimated North American equipment rental industry revenue growth (5)11%4%2023 projected North American industry equipment rental revenue growth4%CUSTOMERS/SUPPLIERSLargest customer percent of total revenues1%1%Top 10 customers percent of total revenues4%4%Largest supplier percent of capital expenditures10%9%Top 10 supplier percent of capital expenditures45%49% Mobile storage equipment and modular office space (1)Reflects the estimated impact of inflation on the revenue productivity of fleet based on OEC, which is recorded at cost. (2)Reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates, time utilization, and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue. See note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the different types of equipment rentals revenue. Rental rate changes are calculated based on the year-over-year variance in average contract  2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents rates, weighted by the prior period revenue mix. Time utilization is calculated by dividing the amount of time an asset is on rent by the amount of time the asset has been owned during the year. Mix includes the impact of changes in customer, fleet, geographic and segment mix. The positive fleet productivity for 2021 includes the impact of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions, as discussed further below. The COVID-19 volume declines were most pronounced in 2020, and in 2021 and 2022, we saw evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our end-markets. See \"Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\" below for further discussion of our end-markets. (3)Reflects the combined impact of changes in the other types of equipment rentals revenue (see note 3 for further detail), excluding owned equipment rental revenue. (4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. (\"Ahern Rentals\"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see \"Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association (\"ARA\"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent interest rate, while URNA's immediately prior issuance in August 2021 of $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes was at a 3 \u00be percent interest rate. Additionally, the weighted average interest rates on our variable debt instruments were 3.3 percent in 2022 and 1.4 percent in 2021. See Item 7A\u2014Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information related to interest rate risk. We have experienced and are continuing to experience inflationary pressures. A portion of inflationary cost increases is passed on to customers. The most significant cost increases that are passed on to customers are for fuel and delivery, and there are other costs for which the pass through to customers is less direct, such as repairs and maintenance, and labor. The impact of inflation and increased interest rates may be significant in the future. COVID-19 was first identified in people in late 2019. COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. Uncertainty remains regarding the potential impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on the operations and financial position of United Rentals, and on the global economy, which will be driven by, among other things, any resurgences in cases, the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and the measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health. In March 2020, we first experienced rental volume declines associated with COVID-19, and the COVID-19 impact was most pronounced in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, we saw evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our end-markets. The health and safety of our employees and customers has been, and remains, our top priority, and we also implemented a detailed COVID-19 response plan, which we believe helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our results. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed in 2021 and 2020 include detailed disclosures addressing the COVID-19 impact.   We continue to assess the economic environment in which we operate and any developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, and take appropriate actions to address the economic and other challenges we face. See \"Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\" below for a discussion of our end-markets, and Item 1A- Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks related to us and our business. Human Capital The Company\u2019s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop talent to deliver on the Company\u2019s strategy. To support these objectives, the Company\u2019s human resources programs are designed to: keep people safe  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents and healthy; enhance the Company\u2019s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more inclusive; acquire and retain diverse talent; reward and support employees through competitive pay and benefit programs; develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions; and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing workforce. See \u201cLocations/Personnel\u201d in the table above for information on employee counts.  The Company focuses on the following in managing its human capital: \u2022Health and safety: We have a safety program that focuses on implementing management systems, policies and training programs and performing assessments to see that workers are trained properly and that injuries and incidents are prevented. All of our employees are empowered with stop-work authority which enables them to immediately stop any unsafe or potentially hazardous working condition or behavior they may observe. We utilize a mixture of indicators to assess the safety performance of our operations, including total recordable injury rate (TRIR), preventable motor vehicle incidents per million miles, corrective actions and near miss frequency and have disclosed a goal to further reduce our TRIR. We also recognize outstanding safety behaviors through our annual awards program.   \u2022Employee wellness: The Company\u2019s Live Well, Safe & Healthy program is a comprehensive approach to wellness that encourages healthy behaviors and is intended to raise morale, productivity and overall employee engagement. The program includes a biometric screening at work or off-site, a health assessment, a paid day off to be used for a wellness exam or day of service, tobacco cessation support, and participation incentives. Additionally, employees and family members can participate in virtual health challenges to encourage daily activity. Approximately 50 percent of eligible employees participated in the program in 2022. \u2022Diversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d): We believe that an inclusive and diverse team is key to the success of our culture. Our commitment to DEI is demonstrated through many efforts including employee-led employee resource groups (\u201cERGs\u201d); company-wide DEI goals; and inclusive volunteering opportunities. Our four ERGs aim to represent and support the diverse communities that make up our workforce by facilitating: networking and connecting with peers; education and awareness efforts; and leadership and skill development. The Company has internal goals for overall workforce diversity and for specific positions, and we have disclosed a goal to increase the percentage of diverse employees in sales and management roles, reflecting our commitment to increase diverse representation in our talent pipeline. There has been positive progress in these goals, as reflected in an over four-percentage point increase in diverse employees in sales and management roles from 29.1 percent in 2019 to 33.5 percent in 2022. In addition, the Company has made hiring, promotion, and fair inclusion of veterans a priority, through its veterans ERG and external partnerships that support this goal. The Company also engaged in a Company-wide volunteering initiative in 2022 for employees to make a positive impact for their teams, communities and customers.   \u2022Compensation programs and employee benefits: Our compensation and benefits programs provide a package designed to attract, retain and motivate employees. In addition to competitive base salaries, the Company provides a variety of short-term, long-term and commission-based incentive compensation programs to reward performance relative to key financial, human capital and customer experience metrics. We offer comprehensive benefit options including paid time off, retirement savings plans, medical and prescription drug benefits, dental and vision benefits, accident and critical illness insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, legal coverage, auto/home insurance, identity theft insurance and tuition assistance. Additionally, we have conducted four company-wide stock grant programs for employees since 2014 \u2013 the most recent grant took place in 2022 and was in honor of our 25th anniversary. \u2022Employee experience and retention: To evaluate our employee experience and retention efforts, we monitor a number of employee measures, such as employee retention, internal promotions and referrals. For example, voluntary employee turnover, which represents voluntary terminations during the year divided by average headcount during the year, was 13.1 percent, 13.5 percent and 9.1 percent for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We also conduct an annual employee experience survey, which provides valuable information on drivers of engagement and areas where we can improve. In 2022, we switched survey administration to Peakon (a Workday company). Our 2022 employee experience survey showed strong results with average responses ranging from 8.4 to 9.2 out of 10 in each of our four survey categories: Engagement (8.5), Diversity & Inclusion (8.7), Health & Wellbeing (8.4) and Safety Commitment (9.2), which placed us in the top 10 percent of the Peakon Benchmark for Commercial and Professional Services Companies for each survey category. To provide an open and frequent line of communication for all employees, we host town hall meetings and quarterly all employee conference calls, and utilize Workplace, a virtual collaboration platform for our employees, to engage with our full team. The Company also sponsors the United Compassion Fund, an employee-funded 501(c)(3) charity that provides financial assistance to fellow employees in need. In 2022, employees voluntarily donated approximately $1.2 million to the fund, and employees received 338 grants totaling approximately $1.0 million. 4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Training and development: The Company is committed to the continual development of its employees. We aim for all new hires to attend JumpSTART, a new hire orientation, to quickly acclimate them to our culture, as well as applicable new hires to attend Center of Excellence (job related) training within 90 days of hire. We offer a wide array of training solutions (classroom, hands-on, e-learning and experience maps) for further development of our employees to help them achieve their career goals. In addition, as we did in 2022, we aim to regularly develop new training programs, launch pilot programs and expand leadership opportunities for our employees. In 2022, our employees enhanced their skills through approximately 645,000 hours of training, including safety training, sales and leadership training and equipment-related training from our suppliers. Although we still deliver some training virtually, we pivoted back to in-person training in 2022 (most training was delivered virtually during 2021 and 2020, primarily due to COVID-19). Our performance process encourages employee check-ins throughout the year to discuss performance and career goals, as well as development opportunities at all levels across the Company. Strategy For the past several years, as we continued to manage the impact of global economic conditions and COVID-19, we executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. Our general strategy focuses on profitability and return on invested capital, and, in particular, calls for: \u2022A consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single lead contact who can coordinate the cross-selling of the various services we offer throughout our network. We utilize a proprietary software application, Total Control\u00ae, which provides our key customers with a single in-house software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs. Total Control\u00ae is a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong, long-term relationships with our larger customers. Our digital capabilities, including our Total Control\u00ae platform, allow our sales teams to provide contactless end-to-end customer service; \u2022The further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix, with a dual objective: to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base, and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth. We believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts, primarily large construction and industrial customers, as well as select local contractors. Our fleet team's analyses are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns; \u2022A continued focus on \u201cLean\u201d management techniques, including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement. We have a dedicated team responsible for reducing waste in our operational processes, with the objectives of: condensing the cycle time associated with preparing equipment for rent; optimizing our resources for delivery and pickup of equipment; improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations; and implementing customer service best practices;  \u2022The continued expansion and cross-selling of adjacent specialty and services products, which enables us to provide a \"one-stop\" shop for our customers. We believe that the expansion of our specialty business, as exhibited by our acquisition of General Finance Corporation (\u201cGeneral Finance\u201d), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as our tools and onsite services offerings, will further position United Rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings; and \u2022The pursuit of strategic acquisitions to continue to expand our core equipment rental business, as exhibited by our recently completed acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Strategic acquisitions allow us to invest our capital to expand our business, further driving our ability to accomplish our strategic goals.  Industry Overview and Economic Outlook  United Rentals serves the following three principal end-markets for equipment rental in North America: industrial and other non-construction; commercial (or private non-residential) construction; and residential construction, which includes remodeling. We also have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. See Item\u00a02\u2014Properties for further geographical detail on our rental network. In 2022, based on our classification of the vertical market segments in which our equipment was used: \u2022Industrial and other non-construction rentals represented approximately 48 percent of our rental revenue, primarily reflecting rentals to manufacturers, energy companies, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, shipbuilders, utilities, retailers and infrastructure entities;  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Commercial construction rentals represented approximately 47 percent of our rental revenue, primarily reflecting rentals related to the construction and remodeling of facilities for office space, lodging, healthcare, entertainment and other commercial purposes; and \u2022Residential rentals represented approximately five percent of our rental revenue, primarily reflecting rentals of equipment for the construction and renovation of homes.  We estimate that, based on industry estimates from the ARA, 2022 North American equipment rental industry revenue grew approximately 11 percent year-over-year. In 2022, our full year rental revenue increased by 23.3 percent year-over-year, which included the impact of the General Finance acquisition that was completed in May 2021 and the Ahern Rentals acquisition that was completed in December 2022, both of which are discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. The impact of these acquisitions on our equipment rentals revenue is primarily reflected in the year-over-year increase in average OEC of 13.6 percent for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022. Our estimated North American market share of approximately 17 percent as of December\u00a031, 2022, which included the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals, increased from 15 percent as of December\u00a031, 2021,which did not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals, as the acquisition was completed in 2022. In 2023, based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators, we expect that North American industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 4 percent. Competitive Advantages  We believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages:  Large and Diverse Rental Fleet. Our large and diverse fleet allows us to serve large customers that require substantial quantities and/or wide varieties of equipment. We believe our ability to serve such customers should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position.  We manage our rental fleet, which is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry, utilizing a life-cycle approach that focuses on satisfying customer demand and optimizing utilization levels. As part of this life-cycle approach, we closely monitor repair and maintenance expense and can anticipate, based on our extensive experience with a large and diverse fleet, the optimum time to dispose of an asset.  Significant Purchasing Power. We purchase large amounts of equipment, contractor supplies and other items, which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing, warranty and other terms with our vendors.  National Account Program. Our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. National accounts are generally defined as customers with potential annual equipment rental spend of at least $500,000 or customers doing business in multiple states. We offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across North America, a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs. National accounts are a subset of key accounts, which are our accounts that are managed by a single point of contact. Establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory.  Operating Efficiencies. We benefit from the following operating efficiencies:  \u2022Equipment Sharing Among Branches. Each branch within a region can access equipment located elsewhere in the region. This fleet sharing increases equipment utilization because equipment that is idle at one branch can be marketed and rented through other branches. Additionally, fleet sharing allows us to be more disciplined with our capital spend.  \u2022Customer Care Center. We have a Customer Care Center (\"CCC\") in Charlotte, North Carolina that handles all telephone calls to our customer service telephone line, 1-800-UR-RENTS. The CCC handles many of the 1-800-UR-RENTS telephone calls without having to route them to individual branches, and allows us to provide a more uniform quality experience to customers, manage fleet sharing more effectively and free up branch employee time.  \u2022Consolidation of Common Functions. We reduce costs through the consolidation of functions that are common to our branches, such as accounts payable, payroll, benefits and risk management, information technology and credit and collection.  Our information technology systems, some of which are proprietary and some of which are licensed, support our operations. Our information technology infrastructure facilitates our ability to make rapid and informed decisions, respond quickly to changing market conditions and share rental equipment among branches. We have an in-house team of information technology specialists that supports our systems.  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our information technology systems are accessible to management, branch and call center personnel. Leveraging information technology to achieve greater efficiencies and improve customer service is a critical element of our strategy. Each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our data center. Rental transactions can be entered at these workstations, or through various mobile applications, to be processed on a real-time basis.  Our information technology systems:  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0enable branch personnel to (i)\u00a0determine equipment availability, (ii)\u00a0access all equipment within a geographic region and arrange for equipment to be delivered from anywhere in the region directly to the customer, (iii)\u00a0monitor business activity on a real-time basis and (iv)\u00a0obtain customized reports on a wide range of operating and financial data, including equipment utilization, rental rate trends, maintenance histories and customer transaction histories;  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0allow our mobile sales and service team members to support our customers efficiently while in the field;  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0permit customers to access and manage their accounts online; and  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0allow management to obtain a wide range of operational and financial data.  We have a fully functional back-up facility designed to enable business continuity for our core rental and financial systems in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative. This back-up facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems. Strong Brand Recognition. As the largest equipment rental company in the world, we have strong brand recognition, which helps us attract new customers and build customer loyalty.  Geographic and Customer Diversity. We primarily operate in the United States and Canada, and have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and our global branch network includes 1,521 rental locations. See Item\u00a02\u2014Properties for further geographical detail on our branch network. Our North American network operates in 49 U.S. states and every Canadian province, and serves customers that range from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. We believe that our geographic and customer diversity provides us with many advantages including:  \u2022enabling us to better serve national account customers with multiple locations;  \u2022helping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used equipment resale markets across North America; and  \u2022reducing our dependence on any particular customer.  \u00a0Our foreign operations are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include (i)\u00a0the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and (ii)\u00a0the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions. For additional financial information regarding our geographic diversity, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Strong and Motivated Branch Management. Each of our full-service branches has a manager who is supervised by a district manager. We believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry, and we empower them, within budgetary guidelines, to make day-to-day decisions concerning branch matters. Each regional office has a management team that monitors branch, district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls, including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating reviews.  Risk Management and Safety Programs. Our risk management department is staffed by experienced professionals directing the procurement of insurance, managing claims made against the Company, and developing loss prevention programs to address workplace safety, driver safety and customer safety. The department\u2019s primary focus is on the protection of our employees and assets, as well as protecting the Company from liability for accidental loss. Segment Information  We have two reportable segments\u2013 general rentals and specialty. Segment financial information is presented in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.  The general rentals segment includes the rental of construction, aerial and industrial equipment, general tools and light equipment, and related services and activities. The general rentals segment\u2019s customers include construction and industrial  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities and homeowners. The general rentals segment is comprised of four geographic divisions\u2014Central, Northeast, Southeast and West\u2014and operates throughout the United States and Canada.  The specialty segment includes the rental of specialty construction products such as (i) trench safety equipment, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work, (ii) power and HVAC equipment, such as portable diesel generators, electrical distribution equipment, and temperature control equipment, (iii) fluid solutions equipment primarily used for fluid containment, transfer and treatment, and (iv) mobile storage equipment and modular office space. The specialty segment\u2019s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. This segment primarily operates in the United States and Canada, and has a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Products and Services  Our principal products and services are described below.  Equipment Rental. We offer for rent approximately 4,600 classes of rental equipment on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis. The types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial equipment; aerial work platforms; trench safety equipment; power and HVAC equipment; fluid solutions equipment; mobile storage equipment and modular office space; and general tools and light equipment.   Sales of Rental Equipment. We routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repair and maintenance costs, as well as the composition and size of our fleet. We also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for the equipment. Consistent with the life-cycle approach we use to manage our fleet, the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors, including changing general economic conditions, growth opportunities, the market for used equipment, the age of our fleet and the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer demand.  We utilize many channels to sell used equipment: through our national and export sales forces, which can access many resale markets across our network; at auction; through brokers; and directly to manufacturers. We also sell used equipment through our website, which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale. Sales of New Equipment. We sell equipment such as aerial lifts, reach forklifts, telehandlers, compressors and generators from many leading equipment manufacturers. The type of new equipment that we sell varies by location.  Contractor Supplies Sales. We sell a variety of contractor supplies including construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies.   Service and Other Revenues. We offer repair and maintenance services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers.   Customers  Our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. Our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors, including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy, including construction opportunities with different customers. Our customers include:  \u2022construction companies that use equipment for constructing and renovating commercial buildings, warehouses, industrial and manufacturing plants, office parks, airports, residential developments and other facilities;  \u2022industrial companies\u2014such as manufacturers, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, ship builders and utilities\u2014that use equipment for plant maintenance, upgrades, expansion and construction;  \u2022municipalities that require equipment for a variety of purposes; and  \u2022homeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations.  Our business is seasonal, with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months.  Sales and Marketing  We market our products and services through multiple channels as described below.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Sales Force. Our sales representatives work in our branches and at our customer care center, and are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs. We have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction.  National Account Program. Our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. Our national account team closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area. Online Rental Platform (UROne\u00ae). Our customers can check equipment availability and pricing, and reserve equipment online, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by accessing our equipment catalog and used equipment listing, which can be found at www.unitedrentals.com. Our customers can also use our UR Control\u00ae application to actively manage their rental process and access real-time reports on their business activity with us. Total Control\u00ae. We utilize a proprietary software application, Total Control\u00ae, which provides our key customers with a single in-house software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs. This software can be integrated into the customers' enterprise resource planning system. Total Control\u00ae is a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong, long-term relationships with our larger customers. Advertising. We promote our business through local and national advertising in various media, including television, trade publications, yellow pages, the internet, radio and direct mail. We also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local and national promotional events.  Suppliers  Our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements.\u00a0This approach is designed to ensure that the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand. We utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors. We consider product capabilities and industry position, the terms being offered, product liability history, customer acceptance and financial strength. We believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories. For a discussion of the risks associated with potential supply chain disruptions, see Item 1A- Risk Factors (\u201cOperational Risks-Disruptions in our supply chain could result in adverse effects on our results of operations and financial performance\"). Competition We primarily operate in the United States and Canada, and have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The North American equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive. As the largest equipment rental company in the industry, we estimate that we have an approximate 17 percent market share, which includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals, in North America based on 2022 total equipment rental industry revenues as measured by the ARA. Estimated market share is calculated by dividing our total 2022 North American rental revenue, plus the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals, by ARA\u2019s forecasted 2022 industry revenue. Our competitors primarily include small, independent businesses with one or two rental locations; regional competitors that operate in one or more states; public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally; and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because, as a larger company, we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors. These advantages include greater purchasing power, the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services, and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to, and in anticipation of, customer demand. The fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share, however, may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rental rate pressure. See \"Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\" above for a discussion of our end-markets, as well as projected market performance in 2023.
