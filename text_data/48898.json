Our products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico, the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d), the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), Brazil, Australia, Spain and Ireland. Hubbell also participates in joint ventures in Hong Kong and the Philippines, and maintains offices in Singapore, Italy, China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Chile, and countries in the Middle East.  The Company\u2019s reporting segments consist of the Utility Solutions segment and the Electrical Solutions segment.

The Utility Solutions segment (58% of consolidated revenues in 2022, 56% in 2021 and 56% in 2020) consists of businesses that design, manufacture, and sell a wide variety of electrical distribution, transmission, substation, and telecommunications products, which support applications In Front of the Meter. This includes utility transmission & distribution (T&D) components such as arresters, insulators, connectors, anchors, bushings, enclosures, cutoffs and switches. The Utility Solutions segment also offers solutions that serve The Edge of the utility infrastructure, including smart meters, communications systems, and protection and control devices. Hubbell Utility Solutions supports the electrical distribution, electrical transmission, water, gas distribution, telecommunications, and solar and wind markets. While Hubbell believes its sales in this area are not materially dependent upon any customer or group of customers, a substantial variability in purchases by electrical utilities would affect this segment.  \u00a0 Products of the Utility Solutions segment are sold under the following brands and/or trademarks:\u2022Aclara\u00ae\u2022Chance\u00ae\u2022Anderson\u00ae\u2022PenCell\u00ae\u2022Fargo\u00ae\u2022Hubbell\u00ae\u2022Polycast\u00ae\u2022Opti-loop Design\u00ae\u2022Quazite\u00ae\u2022Quadri*sil\u00ae\u2022Trinetics\u00ae\u2022Reuel\u00ae\u2022Electro Composites\u00ae\u2022USCO\u2122\u2022CDR\u2122\u2022RFL Design\u00ae\u2022Hot Box\u00ae\u2022PCORE\u00ae\u2022Delmar\u2122\u2022Turner Electric\u00ae\u2022EMC\u2122\u2022Longbow\u2122\u2022Ohio Brass\u00ae\u2022Meramec\u00ae\u2022Reliaguard\u00ae\u2022Greenjacket\u00ae\u2022Armorcast\u00ae\u2022Beckwith Electric\u2122\u2022Continental\u00ae\u2022R.W.

The Electrical Solutions segment (42% of consolidated revenues in 2022, 44% in 2021 and 44% in 2020) comprises businesses that sell stock and custom products including standard and special application wiring device products, rough-in electrical products, connector and grounding products, and lighting fixtures, as well as other electrical equipment.   Products of the Electrical Solutions segment have applications in the light industrial, non-residential, wireless communications, transportation, data center, and heavy industrial markets. Electrical Solutions segment products are typically used in and around industrial, commercial and institutional facilities by electrical contractors, maintenance personnel, electricians, utilities, and telecommunications companies. In addition, certain of our businesses design and manufacture industrial controls and communication systems used in the non-residential and industrial markets. Many of these products are designed such that they can also be used in harsh and hazardous locations where a potential for fire and explosion exists due to the presence of flammable gasses and vapors. Harsh and hazardous products are primarily used in the oil and gas (onshore and offshore) and mining industries. We also offer a variety of lighting fixtures, wiring devices and electrical products that have residential and utility applications, including residential products with Internet-of-Things (\"IoT\") enabled technologies.  These products are sold under various brands and/or trademarks and are primarily sold through electrical and industrial distributors, home centers, retail and hardware outlets, lighting showrooms and residential product oriented internet sites. Special application products are primarily sold through wholesale distributors to contractors, industrial customers and original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d).

These operations manufacture, assemble and/or procure and market Hubbell products and services for both the Utility Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments. \u00a0 See Note 21 \u2014 Industry Segments and Geographic Area Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors relating to manufacturing in and sourcing from foreign countries.  Customers  We have an extensive customer base of distributors, wholesalers, electric utilities, OEMs, electrical contractors, telecommunications companies and retail and hardware outlets. We are not dependent on a single customer, however, our top ten customers account for approximately 43% of our Net sales.   Raw Materials  Raw materials used in the manufacture of Hubbell products primarily include steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, zinc, nickel, plastics, phenolics, elastomers and petrochemicals. Hubbell also purchases certain electrical and electronic components, including solenoids, lighting ballasts, printed circuit boards, integrated circuit chips and cord sets, from a number of suppliers. Hubbell is not materially dependent upon any one supplier for raw materials used in the manufacture of its products and equipment however the cost and supply of these materials may be affected by disruptions in availability of raw materials, components or sourced finished goods. See also Item\u00a07A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u00a0  Patents \u00a0 Hubbell has approximately 3,000 active United States and foreign patents covering a portion of its products, which expire at various times. While Hubbell deems these patents to be of value, it does not consider its business to be dependent upon patent protection. Hubbell also licenses products under patents owned by others, as necessary, and grants licenses under certain of its patents.\u00a0  Working Capital \u00a0 Inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable levels, payment terms and, where applicable, return policies are in accordance with the general practices of the electrical products industry and standard business procedures.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u00a0  Backlog \u00a0 Substantially all of the backlog existing at December 31, 2022 in the Electrical Solutions segment is expected to be shipped to customers in 2023. In the Utility Solutions segment, the backlog existing at December 31, 2022 includes backlog expected to be shipped during 2023, along with $320 million of backlog of contracts that span multiple years, primarily related to long-term contracts of the Aclara business to deliver and install meters and grid monitoring sensor technology. The backlog of orders believed to be firm at December 31, 2022 was $2,463.4 million compared to $1,848.0 million at December\u00a031, 2021. Although this backlog is important, the majority of Hubbell\u2019s revenues result from sales of inventoried products or products that have short periods of manufacture.   Competition \u00a0 Hubbell experiences substantial competition in all categories of its business, but does not compete with the same companies in all of its product categories. The number and size of competitors vary considerably depending on the product line. Hubbell cannot specify with precision the number of competitors in each product category or their relative market position. However, some of its competitors are larger companies with substantial financial and other resources. Hubbell considers product performance, reliability, quality and technological innovation as important factors relevant to all areas of its business and considers its reputation as a manufacturer of quality products to be an important factor in its business. In addition, product price, service levels and other factors can affect Hubbell\u2019s ability to compete.                                                                            HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K5 HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K5 HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K5 HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 5   Environment \u00a0 The Company is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment. The Company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury to its employees and its customers\u2019 employees and that the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. \u00a0 Like other companies engaged in similar businesses, the Company has incurred or acquired through business combinations, remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination, and is a party to product liability and other lawsuits and claims associated with environmental matters, including past production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. However, considering past experience and reserves, the Company does not anticipate that these matters will have a material adverse effect on earnings, capital expenditures, financial condition or competitive position.

We dedicate resources to track and monitor safety and recordable incidents using an enterprise-wide data management system.

In October 2022, as a showing of appreciation to our employees continued excellence, the Company provided all employees globally with a Global Recharge Day. This paid day off provided all employees an opportunity to relax, refresh and recharge.  In 2022, Hubbell conducted an enterprise-wide employee survey, the Elevate Employee Experience Survey to better understand the voices of our employees worldwide. Elevate was the largest survey conducted by the Company and over 80% of Hubbell\u2019s employees responded, providing insights that the Company is translating into action plans.       6HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 6HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 6HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K 6 HUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K    Information about our Executive Officers Name (1)AgePresent PositionBusiness ExperienceGerben W.
