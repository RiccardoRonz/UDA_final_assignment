{"cik": 1035443, "item_1A": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Overview  We are a Maryland corporation formed in October\u00a01994 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE), an S&P 500\u00ae company, is a best-in-class, mission-driven life science REIT making a positive and lasting impact on the world. As the pioneer of the life science real estate niche since its founding in 1994, Alexandria is the preeminent and longest-tenured owner, operator, and developer of collaborative life science, agtech, and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, including Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research Triangle. The trusted partner to approximately 1,000 tenants, Alexandria has a total market capitalization of $35.0 billion and an asset base in North America of 74.6 million SF as of December 31, 2022, which includes 41.8 million RSF of operating properties and 5.6 million RSF of Class A properties undergoing construction, 9.9\u00a0million RSF of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, and 17.3 million SF of future development projects.  We develop dynamic urban cluster campuses and vibrant ecosystems that enable and inspire the world\u2019s most brilliant minds and innovative companies to create life-changing scientific and technological breakthroughs. We believe in the utmost professionalism, humility, and teamwork. Our tenants include multinational pharmaceutical companies; public and private biotechnology companies; life science product, service, and medical device companies; digital health, technology, and agtech companies; academic and medical research institutions; U.S. government research agencies; non-profit organizations; and venture capital firms. Alexandria has a longstanding and proven track record of developing Class A properties clustered in life science, agtech, and technology campuses that provide our innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. Alexandria also provides strategic capital to transformative life science, agrifoodtech, climate innovation, and technology companies through our venture capital platform. We believe our unique business model and diligent underwriting ensure a high-quality and diverse tenant base that results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. Our portfolio includes 64 operating properties and development projects that are held by consolidated real estate joint ventures and four properties that are held by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. The occupancy percentage of our operating properties in North America was 94.8% as of December\u00a031, 2022. Our 10-year average occupancy percentage of our operating properties as of December\u00a031, 2022 was 96%. Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represented 48% of our total annual rental revenue in effect as of December\u00a031, 2022. Additional information regarding our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures is included in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K. Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is included in \u201cItem 1A. Risk factors\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K.  1 1 1    Business objective and strategies  Our primary business objective is to maximize long-term asset value and shareholder returns based on a multifaceted platform of internal and external growth. A key element of our strategy is our unique focus on Class A properties located in collaborative life science, agtech, and technology campuses in AAA innovation clusters. These key campus locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space. They generally represent highly desirable locations for tenancy by life science, agtech, and technology entities because of their close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. Our strategy also includes drawing upon our deep and broad real estate, life science, agtech, and technology relationships in order to identify and attract new and leading tenants and to source additional value-creation real estate.  Our tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science, agtech, and technology industries and reflects our focus on regional, national, and international tenants with substantial financial and operational resources. For a more detailed description of our properties and tenants, refer to \u201cItem 2. Properties\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K. We have an experienced Board of Directors and are led by an executive and senior management team with extensive experience in the real estate, life science, agtech, and technology industries.  Acquisitions  We seek to identify and acquire high-quality properties in our target cluster markets. Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the prospective property or properties, including:  \u2022Proximity to centers of innovation and technological advances; \u2022Location of the property and our strategy in the relevant market, including our mega campus strategy; \u2022Quality of existing and prospective tenants; \u2022Condition and capacity of the building infrastructure; \u2022Physical condition of the structure and common area improvements; \u2022Quality and generic characteristics of the improvements; \u2022Opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for re-tenanting or renewing occupied space; \u2022Availability of and/or ability to add appropriate tenant amenities; \u2022Availability of land for future ground-up development of new space; \u2022Opportunities to generate higher rent through redevelopment of existing space; \u2022The property\u2019s unlevered yields;  \u2022Potential impacts of climate change and extreme weather conditions; and \u2022Our ability to increase the property\u2019s long-term financial returns.  Development, redevelopment, and pre-construction  A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital toward the development and redevelopment of new Class A properties, as well as property enhancements of certain acquired properties. These projects are generally located in collaborative life science, agtech, and technology campuses in AAA innovation clusters and are focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of our diverse group of tenants.  Development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable facilities. Redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into office/laboratory, agtech, or tech office space. We generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new Class A office/laboratory, agtech, and tech office space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality Class A properties.   We seek to meet growing demand from our stakeholders and continuously improve the efficiency of our buildings. Additionally, we have committed to significant building goals to promote wellness and productivity for our buildings\u2019 occupants, including targeting a LEED\u00ae Gold or Platinum certification on all new ground-up construction projects.   Pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements, which are focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value to our future ground-up developments and are required for the vertical construction of buildings.  Another key component of our business model is our value-creation redevelopment of existing office, warehouse, or shell space, or newly acquired properties, into high-quality, generic, and reusable office/laboratory space that can be leased at higher rental rates. Our redevelopment strategy generally includes significant pre-leasing of projects prior to the commencement of redevelopment. We generally do not commence vertical construction of new projects prior to achieving significant pre-leasing. 2 2 2    Non-real estate investments  We also hold strategic investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science, agtech, and technology industries. We invest primarily in highly innovative entities whose focus on the development of therapies and products that advance human health and transform patients\u2019 lives is aligned with Alexandria\u2019s purpose of making a positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety, and well-being of the global community. Our status as a REIT limits our ability to make such non-real estate investments. Therefore, we conduct, and will continue to conduct, our non-real estate investment activities in a manner that complies with REIT requirements.   Balance sheet and financial strategy  We seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our stockholders through the ownership, operation, management, and selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of new Class A properties located in collaborative life science, agtech, and technology campuses in AAA innovation clusters, as well as the prudent management of our balance sheet. In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our stockholders by:  \u2022Maintaining access to diverse sources of capital, which include net cash flows from operating activities after dividends, incremental leverage-neutral debt supported by growth in EBITDA, strategic value harvesting and asset recycling through real estate dispositions and sales of partial interests, non-real estate investment sales, sales of equity, and other capital; \u2022Maintaining significant liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program, secured construction loans, marketable securities, issuances of forward equity contracts from time to time, and cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash; \u2022Continuing to improve our credit profile; \u2022Minimizing the amount of debt maturing in a single year; \u2022Maintaining commitment to long-term capital to fund growth; \u2022Maintaining low to modest leverage; \u2022Minimizing variable interest rate risk; \u2022Generating high-quality, strong, and increasing operating cash flows; \u2022Selectively selling real estate assets, including land parcels, non-core and \u201ccore-like\u201d operating assets, and sales of partial interests, and reinvesting the proceeds into our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects; \u2022Allocating capital to Class A properties located in collaborative life science, agtech, and technology campuses in AAA innovation clusters; \u2022Maintaining geographic diversity in urban intellectual centers of innovation; \u2022Selectively acquiring high-quality office/laboratory, agtech, and technology space in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets at prices that enable us to realize attractive returns; \u2022Selectively developing properties in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets; \u2022Selectively redeveloping existing office, warehouse, or shell space, or newly acquired properties, into high-quality, generic, and reusable office/laboratory space that can be leased at higher rental rates in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets; \u2022Renewing existing tenant space at higher rental rates to the extent possible; \u2022Minimizing tenant improvement costs; \u2022Improving investment returns through the leasing of vacant space and the replacing of existing tenants with new tenants at higher rental rates; \u2022Executing leases with high-quality tenants and proactively monitoring tenant health; \u2022Maintaining solid occupancy while attaining high rental rates; \u2022Realizing contractual rental rate escalations; and \u2022Implementing effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating expenses and certain capital expenditures.   3 3 3   Competition  In general, other office/laboratory and technology properties are located in close proximity to our properties. The amount of rentable space available in any market could have a material effect on our ability to rent space and on the rental rates we can attain for our properties. In addition, we compete for investment opportunities with other REITs, insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private equity entities, partnerships, developers, investment companies, owners/occupants, and foreign investors. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to invest more than we can or accept more risk than we are willing to accept. These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the overall expected returns from real estate investments. In addition, as a result of their financial resources, our competitors may offer more free rent concessions, lower rental rates, or higher tenant improvement allowances in order to attract tenants. These leasing incentives could hinder our ability to maintain or raise rents and attract or retain tenants. Competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. Competition in acquiring existing properties and land, both from institutional capital sources and from other REITs, has been very strong over the past several years; however, we believe we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors. As the first, longest-tenured, and pioneering publicly traded life science REIT to focus primarily on the office/laboratory real estate niche, we provide world-class collaborative life science, agtech, and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations and maintain and cultivate many of the most important and strategic relationships in the life science, agtech, and technology industries.  Financial information about our reportable segment  Refer to Note 2 \u2013 \u201cSummary of significant accounting policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for information about our one reportable segment.  Regulation  General  Properties in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe we have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties.  Americans with Disabilities Act  Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d) to the extent that such properties are \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to permit access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.  Environmental matters  Under various environmental protection laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and remediate contamination located on or emanating from that property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. Previous owners may have used some of our properties for industrial and other purposes, so those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or may materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, or develop the real estate or to borrow capital using the real estate as collateral.  State regulations, such as California\u2019s Connelly Act and Proposition 65, among others, require certain building owners and operators to disclose information on the presence of asbestos or other harmful substances. Some of our properties may have asbestos-containing building materials. Environmental laws require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.  In addition, some of our tenants handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their routine operations at our properties. Environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. Environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant\u2019s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us against any related liabilities.   4 4 4   Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on the properties in our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties and do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations, or an asbestos survey. To date, these assessments have not revealed any material environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations, and ongoing expenditures to comply with existing environmental regulations are not expected to be material. Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed all environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns that may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances, or regulations may also impose additional material environmental liabilities.  Insurance  With respect to our properties, we carry commercial general liability insurance, and all-risk property insurance, including business interruption and loss of rental income coverage. We select policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss and the cost of the coverage. In addition, we have obtained earthquake insurance for certain properties located in the vicinity of known active earthquake zones in an amount and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable. We also carry environmental insurance and title insurance policies on our properties. We generally obtain title insurance policies when we acquire a property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. Accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property. Additional information about risk factors that may affect us is included in \u201cItem 1A. Risk factors\u201d in this annual report on Form\u00a010-K.

We place a significant focus on building loyalty and trusted relationships with our employees. We have adopted a Business Integrity Policy that applies to all of our employees, and its receipt and review by each employee is documented and verified annually. To promote an exceptional corporate culture, Alexandria continuously monitors employee satisfaction, seeks employee feedback, and proactively enhances our employee offerings. We participate in annual performance reviews with our employees and conduct formal employee surveys, and our talent management team holds regular meetings with employees to continuously gather feedback and improve the employee experience. The positive employee experience is evidenced by our low voluntary and total turnover rates averaging 3.6% and 7.7%, respectively, over the last five years, from 2018 to 2022, which are substantially lower than the reported average voluntary and total turnover rates of 16.0% and 19.0%, respectively, in the 2022 Nareit Compensation & Benefits Survey (data for 2021).   We recognize that the fundamental strength of Alexandria results from the contributions of each and every team member within the organization and that our future growth is dependent upon the same. Alexandria devotes extraordinary efforts to hiring, developing, and retaining our talented employees, and we understand firsthand the health, happiness, and well-being of our best-in-class team are key factors to the success of our employees and of the Company.  We have an exceptional track record of identifying highly qualified candidates for promotion from within the Company. Alexandria\u2019s executive and senior management teams, represented by our senior vice presidents and above, consist of 60 individuals, averaging 24 years of real estate experience, including 12 years with Alexandria. Moreover, our executive management team alone averages 18 years of experience with the Company. Alexandria\u2019s executive and senior management teams have unique experience and expertise in creating, owning, and operating highly dynamic and collaborative campuses in key urban life science, agtech, and technology cluster locations. These teams also include regional market directors with leading reputations and longstanding relationships within the life science, agtech, and technology communities in their respective urban innovation clusters. We believe that our expertise, experience, reputation, and key relationships in the real estate, life science, agtech, and technology industries provide Alexandria with significant competitive advantages in attracting new business opportunities.  Building a diverse board of directors and inclusive workforce  Our Corporate Governance Guidelines highlight our Board of Directors\u2019 focus on diversity at the board level, which explicitly states the Board\u2019s commitment to considering qualified women and minority director candidates, as well its policy of requesting an initial list of diverse candidates of any search firm it retains.   We strive to create an open and respectful environment in which our employees can actively contribute, have access to opportunities and resources, and realize their full potential. As an equal opportunity employer, we have an Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and a Diversity, Equal Employment Opportunity, and Fair Labor Policy that emphasizes inclusion through hiring and compensation practices and considers a pool of diverse candidates for open positions and internal advancement opportunities.   Furthermore, as a federal government contractor, Alexandria maintains affirmative action plans, which sets forth the policies, practices, and procedures to which the Company is committed in order to ensure that its policies of nondiscrimination and affirmative action are followed for qualified females, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans. To address issues related to pay discrimination, the Company has implemented a ban on any and all inquiries into an applicant\u2019s salary history and we incorporate fair pay reviews into every employment compensation decision. To reinforce our corporate culture of respect, diversity, and inclusion, we provide anti-harassment training annually for all employees.  Providing exceptional benefits to support our employees\u2019 medical and financial health and well-being  We provide a comprehensive benefits package intended to meet and/or exceed the needs of our employees and their families.
