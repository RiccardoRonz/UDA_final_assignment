{"cik": 26172, "item_1A": "ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business  OVERVIEW  We were founded in 1919 as Cummins Engine Company, a corporation in Columbus, Indiana and one of the first diesel engine manufacturers. In 2001, we changed our name to Cummins Inc. We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel, natural gas, electric and hybrid powertrains and powertrain-related components including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems, automated transmissions, axles, drivelines, brakes, suspension systems, electric power generation systems, batteries, electrified power systems, electric powertrains, hydrogen production and fuel cell products.\u00a0We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, dealers and other customers worldwide. We serve our customers through a service network of approximately 460 wholly-owned, joint venture and independent distributor locations and more than 10,000 Cummins certified dealer locations in approximately 190 countries and territories.  Meritor Acquisition On August 3, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Meritor with a purchase price of $2.9 billion (including debt repaid concurrent with the acquisition). Our consolidated results and segment results include Meritor's activity since the date of acquisition. Meritor was split into the newly formed axles and brakes business and electric powertrain. The results for the axles and brakes business are included in our Components segment while the electric powertrain portion is included in our New Power segment. See NOTE 2, \"ACQUISITIONS,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Supply Chain Disruptions  We continue to experience supply chain disruptions, increased price levels and related financial impacts reflected as increased cost of sales and inventory holdings. Our industry continues to be unfavorably impacted by supply chain constraints leading to shortages and price increases across multiple component categories and limiting our collective ability to meet end-user demand. Our customers are also experiencing supply chain issues. Should the supply chain issues continue for an extended period of time or worsen, the impact on our production and supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   OPERATING SEGMENTS We have five complementary operating segments: Engine, Components, Distribution, Power Systems and New Power. These segments share technology, customers, strategic partners, brand recognition and our distribution network in order to compete more efficiently and effectively in their respective markets. In each of our operating segments, we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, price, total cost of ownership, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support.  We use segment earnings or losses before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and noncontrolling interests (EBITDA) as the primary basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable operating segments. We believe EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. See NOTE 24, \"OPERATING SEGMENTS,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information and a reconciliation of our segment information to the corresponding amounts in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income.  5 5 5  Table of Contents Table of Contents Engine Segment Engine segment sales and EBITDA as a percentage of consolidated results were:  \u00a0Years ended December\u00a031,\u00a0202220212020Percent of consolidated net sales(1)31\u00a0%33\u00a0%32\u00a0%Percent of consolidated EBITDA(1)38\u00a0%39\u00a0%41\u00a0%(1) Measured before intersegment eliminations Percent of consolidated net sales(1) Percent of consolidated EBITDA(1) (1) Measured before intersegment eliminations The Engine segment manufactures and markets a broad range of diesel and natural gas-powered engines under the Cummins brand name, as well as certain customer brand names, for the heavy and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive, construction, mining, marine, rail, oil and gas, defense and agricultural markets.

SUPPLY  The performance of the end-to-end supply chain, extending through to our suppliers, is foundational to our ability to meet customers' expectations and support long-term growth. We are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain. This requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base, as necessary, as we strive to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers. We use a combination of proactive and reactive methodologies to enhance our understanding of supply base risks, which guide the development of risk monitoring and sourcing strategies. Our category strategy process supports the review of our long-term needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally. For the items we decide to purchase externally, the strategies also identify the suppliers we should enter into long-term supply agreements to provide the best technology, the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance. We design and/or manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units and New Power products. Key suppliers are managed through long-term supply agreements that seek to secure capacity, delivery, quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period.  Other important elements of our sourcing strategy include the following: \u2022expanding risk management scope to include sub-tier value chain suppliers for critical components;  \u2022broadening dual and multi-sourcing where applicable; \u2022selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct; and \u2022assuring our suppliers comply with our prohibited and restricted materials policy. As we adjust to the current global supply chain challenges, global inflationary pressures and other global macroeconomic forces, we are experiencing supply chain disruptions, incremental costs and related challenges throughout the supply chain. We continue to monitor the supply chain disruptions utilizing early detection technology complemented by structured supplier risk and resiliency assessments. We increased frequency of formal and informal supplier engagement to address potentially impactful supply base constraints and enhanced collaboration to develop specific countermeasures to mitigate risks. Our global team, located in different regions of the world, uses various approaches to identify and resolve threats to supply continuity. 11 11 11  Table of Contents Table of Contents PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents or trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is significant to our business.  SEASONALITY While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our Power Systems segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period.  LARGEST CUSTOMERS We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them. PACCAR is our largest customer, accounting for 16 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2022, 15 percent in 2021 and 15 percent in 2020. We have long-term supply agreements with PACCAR for our heavy-duty and medium-duty engines and aftertreatment systems. While a significant number of our sales to PACCAR are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines or aftertreatment systems. PACCAR is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2022. The loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of PACCAR vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have supplied engines to PACCAR for 78 years. A summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion. In addition to our agreement with PACCAR, we have long-term heavy-duty and medium-duty engine and aftertreatment system supply agreements with Traton and Daimler. We also have an agreement with Stellantis to supply engines for its Ram trucks. Collectively, our net sales to these four customers, including PACCAR, were 36 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2022, 33 percent in 2021 and 32 percent in 2020. Excluding PACCAR, net sales to any single customer were less than 8 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2022, less than 8 percent in 2021 and less than 7 percent in 2020. These agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine, aftertreatment and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that help provide for the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements. Agreements with most OEMs\u00a0contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.   BACKLOG As we adjust to the current global supply chain challenges, global inflationary pressures and other global macroeconomic forces, we are experiencing supply chain disruptions, incremental costs and related challenges throughout the supply chain. The supply chain disruptions are impacting our business as well as our suppliers and customers resulting in longer lead times in some of our businesses. We have supply agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs, however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm. We are working closely with our suppliers as discussed in the Supply section above as well as with customers to meet the demand and work through backlogs as efficiently as possible.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  In 2022, we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products. We will continue to make investments to develop new products and improve our current technologies to meet future emission standards around the world, improvements in fuel economy performance of diesel and natural gas powered engines and related components as well as development activities around battery electric, fuel cell electric and hydrogen engine solutions. Our research and development programs are focused on product improvements, product extensions, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, testing, technical information technology expenses, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project. When not associated with a sales contract, we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $1.2 billion in 2022, $1.1 billion in 2021 and $903 million in 2020. Contract reimbursements were $110 million, $104 million and $86 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  12 12 12  Table of Contents Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY We are committed to making people's lives better by powering a more prosperous world. That prosperity includes strong communities, robust business and environmental sustainability.  The highest level of accountability for our climate-related risks and opportunities is with the Safety, Environment and Technology (SET) Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board). The internal Action Committee for Environmental Sustainability meets monthly and reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and to the SET Committee at least annually. In 2019, we introduced PLANET 2050, a sustainability strategy focused on three priority areas: addressing climate change and air emissions, using natural resources in the most sustainable way and improving communities. Additional commitments followed including Cummins Water Works, our program for strengthening communities through sustainable water and addressing the global water crisis, and Destination Zero, our long-term product decarbonization strategy. The PLANET 2050 strategy includes nine specific goals to achieve by 2030, including science-based carbon dioxide reduction targets for newly sold products and facilities, as well as aspirational targets for 2050. We started reporting progress in 2022. Key areas of focus in 2022 included product decarbonization pathways, customer sustainability collaboration and circular economy efforts such as incorporating expanded lifecycle analysis tools. The nine PLANET 2050 goals for 2030 are as follows: \u2022Reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from facilities and operations by 50 percent. \u2022Reduce scope three absolute lifetime GHG emissions from newly sold products by 25 percent. \u2022Partner with customers to reduce scope three GHG emissions from products in the field by 55 million metric tons. \u2022Reduce volatile organic compounds emissions from paint and coating operations by 50 percent. \u2022Create a circular lifecycle plan for every part to use less, use better, use again. \u2022Generate 25 percent less waste in facilities and operations as percent of revenue. \u2022Reuse or responsibly recycle 100 percent of packaging plastics and eliminate single-use plastics in dining facilities, employee amenities and events. \u2022Reduce absolute water consumption in facilities and operations by 30 percent. \u2022Produce net water benefits that exceed our annual water use in all our regions. The most recent Sustainability Progress Report, prior reports and a Data Book of more detailed environmental data in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative's Standard core compliance designation is available on our website at www.cummins.com. Our annual submission to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for climate change and water are also available on the website. The climate submission provides information on our scenario planning for climate and other risks and detailed facility emissions data as requested by CDP. We also published reports in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board as well as the framework of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. These reports and data book are not incorporated into this Form 10-K by reference.  We continue to articulate our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues. We are actively engaged around the world to promote science-based climate policies by working with regulatory, industry and other stakeholders, including joining advocacy groups and testifying before legislators and regulators. We will continue to work in partnership with others to advocate for tough, clear and enforceable regulations around the globe to address air and GHG emissions. In 2022, we were named to the S&P Dow Jones World and North American Sustainability Indices. It was the seventeenth consecutive time we were named to the North American index and the second time we were named to the world index since 2013. In 2021, we were named one of the inaugural recipients of the Terra Carta Seal by the Sustainable Markets Initiative, the effort founded by King Charles III while the Prince of Wales to recognize industry leaders in environmental sustainability. In addition, in 2022 we were awarded a gold medal for sustainability performance by EcoVadis, a globally collaborative platform for trading partners to share sustainability performance information. We were named to Investor Business Daily's Best ESG Companies list for performance on environmental, social and governance matters, ranking number 27. We were also ranked number 47 among Barron's Top 100 Most Sustainable Companies.  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  Product Certification and Compliance Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise. Over the past several years we have increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets.  We strive to be a leader in developing and implementing technologies that provide customers with the highest performing products while minimizing the impact on the environment, and we have a long history of working with governments and regulators to achieve these goals. We remain committed to ensuring our products meet all current and future emission standards and delivering value to our customers. Announced in late 2019 and launched in early 2020, the Product Compliance and Regulatory Affairs team leads both engine emissions certification and compliance and regulatory affairs initiatives and reports to the SET Committee of the Board at least annually. This organization is led by the Vice President - Product Compliance and Regulatory Affairs. The focus of this organization is to strengthen our ability to design great products that help our customers win while complying with increasingly challenging global emission regulations. The organization also works to enhance our collaboration with the agencies setting the direction and regulations of emissions as we strive to meet every expectation today while planning for future changes. Following conversations with the\u00a0U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u00a0and California Air Resources Board (CARB) regarding certification for the engines in the 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks, we made the decision to review our certification process and compliance with emission standards. This review is being conducted with external advisors as we strive to ensure the certification and compliance processes for all of our pick-up truck applications are consistent with our internal policies, engineering standards and applicable laws. During conversations with the EPA and CARB about the effectiveness of our pick-up truck applications, the regulators raised concerns that certain aspects of our emissions systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emissions control systems and thereby act as defeat devices. As a result, our internal review focuses, in part, on the regulators\u2019 concerns. We are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pick-up truck applications and to fully address the regulators\u2019 requirements. Based on discussions with the regulators, we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since September 2019. During our ongoing discussions, the regulators turned their attention to other model years and other engines, most notably our pick-up truck applications for RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks for model years 2013 through 2018 and Titan trucks for model years 2016 through 2019. We have also been in communication with Environmental and Climate Change Canada regarding similar issues relating to some of these very same platforms. In connection with these and other ongoing discussions with the EPA and CARB, we are developing a new software calibration and will recall model years 2013 through 2018 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks. We are also developing a new software calibration and hardware fix and will recall model years 2016 through 2019 Titan trucks. We will continue to work together closely with the relevant regulators to develop and implement recommendations for improvement as part of our ongoing commitment to compliance. See NOTE 15, \"COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  Engine Certifications  Our engines are certified globally through various categories within on-highway and off-highway applications. Regulations in these categories typically control nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and GHG. The current on-highway NOx and PM emission standards came into effect in India on April 1, 2020, (Bharat Stage VI), China on July 1, 2019, (National Standard NS VI), the European Union (EU) on January\u00a01, 2013, (Euro\u00a0VI)\u00a0and on January\u00a01, 2010, for the EPA. To meet these regulations, mid-range and heavy-duty engines for India, China, EU and EPA require NOx aftertreatment. NOx reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the XPI High Pressure Common Rail fuel system, SCR technology (in some cases), next-generation cooled EGR, advanced electronic controls, proven air handling and the Cummins Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, EU, EPA and CARB certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements. Emission standards in international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia and Brazil are becoming more stringent. We believe that our experience in meeting the EU and EPA emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows. In 2013, we certified to EPA's first ever GHG regulations for on-highway medium and heavy-duty engines. Additionally, the EPA's 2013 regulations added the requirement of on-board diagnostics, which were introduced on the ISX 15 in 2010, across the full on-highway product line while maintaining the same near-zero emission levels of NOx and PM required in 2010. On-board diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes, service tool interface, in-cab warning lamp and service information availability. The new GHG and fuel-efficiency regulations were required for all heavy-duty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in January 2014. Our GHG certification was the first engine certificate issued by the EPA and uses the same proven base engine with the XPI fuel system, variable geometry turbocharger (VGTTM) and Cummins aftertreatment system with DPF and SCR technology. Application of these engines and aftertreatment technologies continues in our products that comply with the 2021 GHG regulations. Our off-highway engines designed for Tier 4 / Stage V standards were based on our extensive on-highway experience developing SCR, high pressure fuel systems, DPF and VGTTM. Our products offer low fuel consumption, high torque rise and power output, extended maintenance intervals, reliable and durable operation and a long life to overhaul period, all while meeting the most stringent  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents emission standards in the industrial market. Our off-highway products power multiple applications including construction, mining, marine, agriculture, rail, defense and oil and gas and serve a global customer base. The current EPA Tier 4 off-highway emission standards came into effect between 2013-2015 for all engine power categories. The current EU Stage V off-highway emission standards became effective in 2019 for certain engine power categories and were completely effective January 2021 for all remaining categories. Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations  Expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. were not a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in 2023. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations. In the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we were identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites.  Based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material. We have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites. In addition, we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material.  HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES  At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 73,600 persons worldwide, which includes the addition of more than 10,000 employees to our organization through acquisitions completed in 2022. Approximately 23,400 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2023 and 2027. Throughout our more than 100-year history, we always recognized that people drive the strength of our business and our ability to effectively serve our clients and sustain our competitive position. We are focused on harmonizing our approach to talent to provide seamless opportunities and better experiences to our employees around the world. Our workforce strategy cultivates an environment where all employees, regardless of employee type and location, know what is expected of them, are rewarded based on performance and have access to differentiated experiences, tools and leadership coaching to help them develop. This strategy has several key focus areas: creating a diverse, accessible, equitable and inclusive work environment; engaging employees and their families in improving wellness; developing self-aware and effective leaders and extending our talent development programs to our workforce at every level and job type. Leadership and Talent Management Managing our human capital resources is a key focus of the company. In 2020, the Board recast our Compensation Committee as the Talent Management and Compensation Committee to reflect the Board\u2019s commitment to overseeing and providing guidance to our leadership team in this important work.  We strive to create a leadership culture that begins with authentic leaders who create an outstanding place to work by encouraging all employees to achieve their full potential. We encourage leaders to connect our people and their work to our mission, vision, values, brand promise and strategies of the company, motivating and giving them a higher sense of purpose. We have designed leadership and talent development programs for employees ranging from the manufacturing floor and technicians through middle management and executives. When an individual joins Cummins, we are committed to providing both that employee and their manager with the tools and resources to manage their career and navigate in a large global organization. Through our Talent Management strategy our goal is to provide all employees access to the development and career opportunities that a global company enables. Competitive Pay and Benefits To attract and retain the best employees, we focus on providing competitive pay and benefits. Our programs target the market for competitiveness and sustainability while ensuring that we honor our core values. We provide benefit programs with the goal of improving the physical, mental and financial wellness of our employees throughout their lifetime. Some examples include base and variable pay, medical, paid time off, retirement saving plans and employee stock purchase plans. When designing our base pay compensation ranges, we do market analyses to be sure ranges are current and our employees are advancing their earning potential. We also do annual compensation studies to assess market movement, pay equity and living wages. We review wages globally as we continuously work to ensure we are fair, equitable, competitive and can attract and retain the best talent. As an example, during 2022, to recognize extraordinary efforts by employees during the challenges over the last several years, as well as to promote retention in a period of tight labor markets, a one-time employee recognition bonus was provided.  15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents We also provide diverse benefit programs that are aligned with our values and focused on supporting employees and their families based on their unique needs, some of which are: tiered health care costs so that more junior employees pay less for their premiums; paid parental leave for primary and secondary caregivers; advanced medical services from clinicians to support complex health care needs and employee assistance programs with diverse providers that can meet a range of employee needs from race related trauma to financial planning to transgender transition support. Employee Safety and Wellness  Cummins is committed to being world-class in health and safety. We strive to ensure a workplace with zero incidents. We are committed to removing conditions that cause personal injury or occupational illness and we make decisions and promote behaviors that protect others from risk of injury. We publicly disclose metrics on our rate of recordable injuries, our rate of lost workdays due to injury and the rate of injuries involving contractors. Since 2020, we have taken many steps in the employee safety and wellness area including the following: \u2022Executed robust safety protocols for essential on-site personnel. \u2022Implemented a remote work environment where possible for employees who prefer working off-site. \u2022Launched a global mental health awareness campaign to destigmatize conditions such as depression and encourage employees to seek support offered by us. \u2022Launched an aggressive global effort to acquire vaccines and provide them on-site or near-site to our employees, their families and other stakeholders. By partnering with governments and health care providers, we facilitated the delivery of over 45,000 doses of approved vaccines to employees at or near the workplace. This includes over 5,000 shots in the U.S., over 30,000 shots in India and over 10,000 shots in Mexico. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of the company are critical to our ability to innovate, to win in the marketplace and to create sustainable success. Having diverse, accessible, equitable and inclusive workplaces allows us to attract and retain the best employees to deliver results for our shareholders. This is exemplified by the composition of the Board of which 5 of 13 directors are female and 3 of 13 directors are ethnically diverse. In addition, 47 percent of our leadership team is female including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO). We disclose publicly the percentage of women in supervisory roles and the overall workforce. We also launched several initiatives to increase representation of minorities in the workplace. We created a Global Inclusion Leadership Council to oversee more than 100 employee resource groups around the world to provide opportunities to employees from all backgrounds for leadership training, cross cultural learning and professional development. We developed and piloted a diversity, equity and inclusion learning curriculum with a focus on awareness of privilege and unconscious bias. In 2020, we launched Cummins Advocating for Racial Equity (CARE), which seeks to drive a sustainable impact in dismantling institutional racism and creating systemic equity. CARE now has hundreds of employees engaged and has deployed over $30 million in funding to fight racial injustice in the U.S. For more information on the topics above and our management of our human capital resources, please go to sustainability.cummins.com.
