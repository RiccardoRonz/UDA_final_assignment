{"cik": 1396009, "item_1A": "ITEM 1 BUSINESS   Vulcan Materials Company operates primarily in the U.S. and is the nation\u2019s largest supplier of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of aggregates-based construction materials, including asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. We provide the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the U.S. economy. Delivered by trucks, ships, barges and trains, our products are the indispensable materials building homes, offices, places of worship, schools, hospitals and factories, as well as vital infrastructure including highways, bridges, roads, ports and harbors, water systems, campuses, dams, airports and rail networks. As of December 31, 2022, we had 404 active aggregates facilities as shown below.       For additional information regarding our Calica operations in Mexico, see Note 12 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d   While aggregates is our focus and primary business, as of December 31, 2022, we further served our customers through our 71 asphalt facilities and 142 concrete facilities located in Alabama, Arizona, California, Maryland, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Washington D.C. BUSINESS STRATEGY Our strategy and competitive advantage are based on our strength in aggregates, which are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our strategy for long-term value creation is built on: (1) an aggregates-focused business, (2) a disciplined approach to growth management and capital allocation, (3) a focus on continuous compounding improvement in profitability, (4) a holistic approach to land management, and (5) our commitment to safety, health and the environment.

Our 404 active aggregates facilities as of December 31, 2022 provide opportunities to share and scale best practices across our operations and to procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in an efficient and cost-effective manner, both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service, accounting, procurement, technical support and engineering.\uf0a7BUILD AND HOLD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES: Our reserves are critical to our long-term success. We currently have 15.6 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves. They are strategically located to economically serve high-growth areas in the United States that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand. Moreover, there are significant barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets due to stringent zoning and permitting regulations. These restrictions curtail expansion in certain areas, but they also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.   1.

Growth management AND CAPITAL ALLOCATION growth management: Demand for our products is dependent on construction activity and correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. As such, we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in U.S. metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly and to divest assets that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy. During the next decade (2022 - 2032), Woods & Poole Economics projects that 75% of the U.S. population growth, 74% of household formation and 73% of new jobs will occur in Vulcan-served states. Our coast-to-coast footprint serves 20 of the top 25 highest-growth metropolitan statistical areas in 22 states plus Washington D.C.

These investments are fundamental actions that sustain and strengthen the business. They improve the longer-term efficiency, capacity and flexibility of our production, and they support our strong commitment to superior customer service.Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. In 1999, we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California and Arizona and making us one of the nation\u2019s leading producers of asphalt mix. In 2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., expanding our aggregates business in Florida and our aggregates and ready-mixed concrete businesses in other Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. In 2017, we acquired Aggregates USA, greatly expanding our ability to serve customers in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. In 2021, we acquired U.S. Concrete, enhancing and expanding our aggregates-led business in attractive growing metropolitan areas.While an aggregates-focused business, we selectively make investments in downstream products that drive local market profitability. Our downstream businesses (asphalt and concrete) use internally-produced aggregates almost exclusively when available in the market from a Vulcan aggregates operation. In 2017, we entered the asphalt market in Tennessee through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business. In 2018, we entered the asphalt mix and construction paving markets in Alabama and expanded our asphalt operations and service offerings in Texas through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and construction paving businesses. Through our 2021 acquisition of U.S. Concrete, we entered the New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and U.S. Virgin Islands concrete markets and expanded our California, Texas and Washington D.C. concrete markets. We subsequently exited the New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania concrete markets in 2022.Additionally, throughout our history, we have completed many bolt-on aggregates and downstream acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth. From 2020 to 2022, we invested $2,307.4 million in acquisitions as outlined in Note 19 \u201cAcquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201dOur annual Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) decreased 0.7 percentage points (70 basis points) in 2022. While Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% in 2022 (net earnings attributable to Vulcan decreased 14% in 2022), invested capital increased by 18%, primarily as a result of acquisitions.

LAND MANAGEMENTWith more than 240,000 acres in our land portfolio, a long-term holistic approach to preserving land and water is integral to sustaining our success. From pre-mining to mining to reclamation, we are actively managing the entire life cycle of our land to create maximum value for the business, our shareholders and our communities.We are putting land to use before we mine by creating opportunities for agriculture and timber development. After mining, our land and water assets will be converted to other valuable uses including drinking water reservoirs, aquifer recharge basins, public parks, habitat mitigation banks, wetlands, productive farmland and residential and commercial developments. In 2022, we sold excess real estate in Southern California for net proceeds of $23.6 million resulting in a pretax gain of $23.5 million. In 2021, we sold previously mined land in Southern California that we had reclaimed for commercial and retail development for net proceeds of $182.3 million resulting in a pretax net gain of $114.7 million.Because of the evolving needs of our communities, we listen to and collaborate with our neighbors to prepare the land for its highest and best use after mining is complete. For example, in 2021 we partnered with the city of Atlanta to convert our Bellwood Quarry into a reservoir. This reservoir will serve as an emergency water supply for Atlanta, holding more than 2 billion gallons of water from the Chattahoochee River. This amount is enough backup water supply to last between 30 and 90 days \u2014 a significant improvement from the city\u2019s previous reserve of three to five days. We are proud to have worked with the city of Atlanta to provide an extremely valuable asset that protects and serves local communities. Our work with state, regional and local governments to develop solutions today will benefit future generations.   3. compounding improvement in profitability Our focus on the Vulcan Way of Selling (Commercial Excellence & Logistics Innovation) and the Vulcan Way of Operating (Operational Excellence & Strategic Sourcing) has made us one of the most profitable public companies in the industry (as measured by aggregates gross profit per ton). \uf0a7Commercial Excellence \u2014 We place great emphasis on the unique characteristics of each geographic market, and we interact with our customers accordingly.

SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENTA strategy for sustainable, long-term value creation must include doing right by your employees, your neighbors and the environment in which you operate.Our leadership recognized decades ago the significance and importance of leadership in the Safety, Health and Environmental areas. The Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee of our Board of Directors, along with the full Board, has oversight responsibility for our environmental, safety and health programs and results. Our Safety, Health & Environmental Management Committee, made up of the senior leadership team along with other key senior personnel from cross-functional operations and staff disciplines, has the ongoing management responsibility for all of our safety, health and environmental initiatives. We are a leader in our industry in safety performance by applying the shared experiences, expertise and resources at each of our locally led sites with an emphasis on taking care of one another. In 2022, we achieved an overall Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) safety performance of 1.00 injuries per 200,000 employee hours worked, which is both industry-leading and considered world-class.Our community relations programs serve our neighbors while ensuring that we grow and thrive in the communities where we operate. We leverage our charitable foundation and company funds to support food banks, healthcare services, childhood education remote learning programs and other initiatives designed to lessen the difficulties experienced in many of our communities. Our charitable foundation alone has provided nearly $66 million in support over the past 20 years to essential charitable, civic and educational organizations that strengthen and enrich our communities. The actions of our Grandin Sand Plant facility in Florida over the last two years are a prime example of our commitment to community relations. This aggregates operation provided support to federal, state and local government clients to help rebuild from Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Matthew along the Florida coast. We worked with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and county officials to support the reconstruction of beaches to improve public usability and protection from future storm events.We focus on our environmental stewardship programs with the same intensity that we bring to our health and safety initiatives. Our environmental stewardship commitment is designed to protect plant and animal species and habitats, as well as the air we breathe, the water we use and the planet we all share. In all parts of our company, from local operations to our corporate and regional offices to our international business and ocean-going shipping, we are focused on ensuring that our operations are efficient in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable. As an example of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we have been a proud national partner of the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) since 1990 when our Sanders quarry became the first site in the U.S. to obtain certification by WHC. Since then, we have received accreditation for 40 quarry sites containing wildlife enhancement programs. Our reforestation efforts at our Calica quarry in Mexico provide another example of our commitment to environmental stewardship. Since we began closely recording data about our reforestation efforts, we have planted an average of 2,885 trees per hectare, significantly more than the 500 recommended by the National Forestry Commission. Over a nearly 20-year time span, we have planted approximately 80,000 trees. We also maintain nearly 30% of our land as protected forest and as a natural forest conservation area, which contains three Mayan archaeological sites and four cenotes (underground natural pools historically used for sacred Mayan ceremonies).In addition, the recycling of aggregates-containing construction materials including concrete and recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) is an important part of our business. The sources of these materials are highway and infrastructure projects and other demolition projects where concrete structures or asphalt paving is being removed. During 2022, we reused 1.7 million tons of RAP and recycled 2.1 million tons of concrete. The recycling of these aggregates-containing construction materials reduces carbon emissions that impact climate change while providing a valuable service to our customers and communities, extending the life of our aggregates reserves and helping us manage the cost of production.For a discussion of our energy management and greenhouse gas emissions initiatives, see the Environmental Stewardship and Climate Change section later within this Item 1 under Other Business-Related Items.   5.

We have four operating (and reportable) segments (Aggregates, Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium) organized around our principal product lines. As of December 31, 2022, we had 404 active aggregates facilities, 71 asphalt facilities, 142 concrete facilities and 1 calcium facility.

Where practical, we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive. Approximately 82% of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available, high-quality aggregates. We serve these markets from quarries that have access to cost-effective long-haul transportation \u2014 shipping by barge and rail \u2014 and from our quarries in Quintana Roo, Mexico (see Note 12, NAFTA Arbitration) and Puerto Cort\u00e9s, Honduras (acquired in the third quarter of 2022) with our fleet of Panamax-class, self-unloading ships. Additionally, as a result of our 2021 acquisition of U.S. Concrete, we serve markets in California and Hawaii from our quarry in British Columbia, Canada by means of a long-term marine shipping agreement with CSL Americas. Approximately 16% of our total aggregates shipments are delivered by truck to the customer after reaching a sales yard by rail or water. The remaining 2% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.\uf0a7Limited product substitution: There are limited substitutes for quality aggregates. Recycled concrete and asphalt have certain applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However, many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete and require the use of virgin aggregates to meet technical specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities. Likewise, the amount of recycled asphalt included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates is limited due to specifications.\uf0a7Highly fragmented industry: The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of over 5,000 companies that managed over 10,000 operations during 2022. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.Through strategic acquisitions and investments, we have developed an unmatched coast-to-coast footprint of strategically located permitted reserves concentrated in and serving the nation\u2019s key growth centers. We have over 22,000 customers in 22 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Washington D.C., British Columbia (Canada), Freeport (Bahamas), Puerto Cort\u00e9s (Honduras) and Quintana Roo (Mexico).\uf0a7Flexible production capabilities: The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Direct production costs of aggregates primarily include: a) wages and fringe benefits; b) depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization of capital (or long-term) assets; c) operating parts and supplies; d) repair and maintenance; e) third-party contracted services and f) energy (primarily electricity and diesel). Production capacity is flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand. We are currently operating considerably below full capacity, making us extremely well positioned to further benefit from economies of scale when additional growth materializes.\uf0a7raw material inputs largely ControlLED: Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric power.\uf0a7Demand cycles: Long-term growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short-term and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries.The drivers underpinning long-term demand and sustained pricing growth remain firmly in place in both the public and private sectors of the economy. They include: population growth; gains in total employment and in household income and wages; a continuing increase in household formations; the growing need for additional housing stock and housing demand; a multi-year federal transportation law in place and continuing increases in transportation funding at state and local levels; stable state tax receipts; and a multi-year federal infrastructure investment law and continued political awareness and focus on the need to invest in infrastructure.

Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources. In 2022, publicly-funded construction accounted for approximately 40% of our total aggregates shipments, and approximately 22% of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects.\uf0a7Public Sector Funding: Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction spending; public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year laws, which provide certainty in funding amounts, program structures, rules and regulations. Federal spending is governed by authorization, budget and appropriations laws. The level of state and local spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies.\uf0a7STATE AND LOCAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING: Since 2013, 33 states and the District of Columbia have increased or adjusted taxes on motor fuel to increase revenues available for transportation investment, including 14 Vulcan-served states and the District of Columbia. Several states in our footprint index their gas taxes to a measure of inflation, including Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia and the District of Columbia.In addition, we benefit from state and local transportation funding ballot measures. In the 2022 general elections, voters in 20 states approved 88% of over 400 measures, which will generate nearly $23 billion in one-time and recurring revenues for transportation investment. This approval rate was higher than the historical average. Voters have approved an average of 85% of nearly 3,000 transportation investment ballot measures since 2010. Major transportation funding measures in Vulcan-served areas approved in 2022 are estimated to result in $8.5 billion in revenues and bond proceeds primarily dedicated to roads, streets and bridges.\uf0a7federal highway funding: In November 2021, President Biden signed a historic, bi-partisan infrastructure bill, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), into law.The IIJA provides the largest increase in federal highway, road and bridge funding in more than six decades with a five-year reauthorization of Federal-Aid Highway Program funding. The total Federal-Aid Highway Program obligation limitation under IIJA starts at $66.9 billion in Fiscal Funding Year (FFY) 2022 and increases to $72.1 billion in FFY 2026, for a total of nearly $350 billion.These numbers include one-time additional funding for large road and bridge projects, such as $40 billion for bridge repair, replacement and rehabilitation. Of the bridge funds, approximately $16.2 billion is earmarked for projects in Vulcan-served states.In December 2022, President Biden signed the FFY 2023 omnibus spending package, which fully funds the IIJA highway investment levels for FFY 2023. The FFY 2023 spending package also enables states and localities to use funds from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a COVID-19 relief package for infrastructure projects, including highways, roads and bridges. In Vulcan-served states, counties and cities, this amounts to $70 billion additional Federal resources available.The long-term nature of the highway program reauthorization in the IIJA is important. The Federal-Aid Highway Program is the largest component of the law and has provided, on average, 50% of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years. This multi-year authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-range, complex highway projects. In states where we operate, we are well positioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with IIJA and policy implementation.Importantly, building on improvements in the two prior reauthorization laws \u2014 The Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) and Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) \u2014 the IIJA further streamlines project delivery and environmental approval advancements.Project financing remains an important additional component of overall surface transportation spending. The IIJA expands access to private activity bonds for highway and intermodal projects, and sets the Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program authorized at $250 million per year.

A little more than half of the new money is dedicated to transportation sector projects. Beyond highway infrastructure, Vulcan could benefit from IIJA-funded, aggregates-intensive infrastructure projects, such as railroads, airports, seaports, and drinking and wastewater systems.\uf0a7FEDERAL WATER Resources INFRASTRUCTURE: In December 2022, President Biden signed the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 (WRDA 2022) into law, enacting the fifth consecutive biennial authorization for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) since 2014. WRDA 2022 reauthorizes needed investment in America\u2019s ports, channels, locks, dams, and other infrastructure that supports the maritime and waterways transportation system. WRDA 2022 provides the Army Corps with authorization and funding for flood and coastal storm risk management and ecosystem restoration in support of resilience and sustainability. It also authorizes the Army Corps and United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) programs, which support drinking water, wastewater and storm management projects. Notably, WRDA 2022 includes a policy provision that makes permanent the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) cost share for lock and dam construction and major rehabilitation projects, enabling the IWTF to help finance more projects.Private sector CONSTRUCTION MARKETThe private sector construction markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are considerably more cyclical than public construction. In 2022, privately-funded construction accounted for approximately 60% of our total aggregates shipments.\uf0a7Nonresidential Construction: Private nonresidential building construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction. Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally is driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, places of worship and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing. This end market also includes capital investments in public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population.\uf0a7Residential Construction: Household formations in Vulcan-served states continue to outpace household formations in the rest of the United States. The majority of residential construction is for single-family housing with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing and builders\u2019 ability to maintain skilled labor.U.S. housing starts, as measured by Dodge Data & Analytics data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than 0.6 million units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually. In 2022, total annual housing starts in the U.S. reached 1.73 million units.ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS AND MARKETSWe sell aggregates that are used as ballast for construction and maintenance of railroad tracks. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways. In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime.We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our aggregates production facility located in Quintana Roo, Mexico (see Note 12 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d) and our recently acquired aggregates production facilities in British Columbia, Canada and Puerto Cort\u00e9s, Honduras.

We produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete within each of our three geographic markets, as noted below. Aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix by weight and 80% of ready-mixed concrete by weight. In both of these downstream businesses, aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations.2. ASPHALTWe produce and sell asphalt mix in Alabama, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Tennessee and Texas and provide asphalt construction paving services in Alabama, Tennessee and Texas. In August 2022 and October 2020, we strengthened our asphalt positions in California and Texas, respectively, by acquiring additional asphalt operations. For additional details, see Note 19 \u201cAcquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201dThis segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately 95% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt segment primarily through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. The asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement, which we purchase from third-party producers. We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate. We serve our Asphalt segment customers directly from our local production facilities.

For additional details, see Note 19 \u201cAcquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately 95% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt segment primarily through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required. Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. The asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement, which we purchase from third-party producers. We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate. We serve our Asphalt segment customers directly from our local production facilities.    Part I14     Part I14    Part I14     Part I 14        3. CONCRETEWe produce and sell ready-mixed concrete in California, Maryland, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Washington D.C. In April and August 2022, we strengthened our concrete positions in Virginia and California by acquiring additional concrete operations. In August 2021, through our acquisition of U.S. Concrete, we entered the New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and U.S. Virgin Islands concrete markets and expanded our service of the California, Texas and Washington D.C. concrete markets. Subsequently, in November 2022, we exited the New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania concrete markets. In April 2020, we exited the New Mexico ready-mixed concrete market (we retained the concrete plants and mobile fleet which are leased to the buyer and obtained a 20-year aggregates supply agreement). For additional details, see Note 19 \u201cAcquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Ready-mixed concrete consists of cement and other cement-related materials (such as fly ash and slag), aggregates (crushed stone and sand), chemical admixtures and water and is measured in cubic yards. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 80% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment primarily through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.Cement is the binding agent used to bind water, crushed stone and sand in the production of ready-mixed concrete. Other industrial byproducts, such as fly ash from coal burning power plants and slag from the manufacture of iron and silica fume, have cement-related properties that allow them to be used as substitutes for cement depending on the specifications. We purchase cement-related materials from a few suppliers in each of our major geographic markets. Chemical admixtures are generally purchased from suppliers under national purchasing agreements.With the exception of chemical admixtures, each ready-mix facility typically maintains an inventory level of these raw materials sufficient to satisfy its operating needs for a few days. Inventory levels do not decline significantly or comparatively with declines in revenue during seasonally lower periods. We generally maintain inventory at specified levels to maximize purchasing efficiencies and to be able to respond quickly to customer demand.Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. Ready-mixed concrete production also requires cement which we purchase from third-party producers. We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate. We serve our Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck.4. CALCIUMOur Calcium segment is composed of a single calcium operation in Brooksville, Florida. This facility produces calcium products for the animal feed, plastics and water treatment industries with high-quality calcium carbonate material mined at the Brooksville quarry.   3.

Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter, and the lowest are in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic and population fluctuations, and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector.COMPETITORSWe operate in a fragmented industry with a large number of small, privately-held companies. We estimate that the ten largest aggregates producers accounted for 33% of the total U.S. aggregates production in 2022. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan\u2019s total U.S. market share is less than 10%. Other publicly traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:\uf0a7Arcosa, Inc.\uf0a7Cemex S.A.B. de C.V.\uf0a7CRH plc \uf0a7HeidelbergCement AG\uf0a7Holcim Ltd.\uf0a7Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.\uf0a7MDU Resources Group, Inc.\uf0a7Summit Materials, Inc.Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with over 5,000 companies managing over 10,000 operations during 2022, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or extend their existing market positions.CUSTOMERSNo material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business. In 2022, our five largest customers accounted for 7% of our total revenues, and no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our total revenues. Although approximately 40% to 55% of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly-funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, a relatively small portion of our sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly-funded construction, the vast majority of our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with local, state or federal governments. In addition, our sales to government entities span several hundred entities coast-to-coast, ensuring that negative changes to various government budgets would have a muted impact across such a diversified set of government customers.

Part I16     Part I16    Part I16     Part I 16        ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND CLIMATE CHANGEClimate change, or long-term changes in global temperature and other characteristics of the atmosphere, is a global concern. The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) stressed the urgency of taking action to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Due to human influence on the climate from carbon-based energy use and unsustainable natural resource management, the Earth is now about 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in the 1800s.As an industry leader, Vulcan is, and has always been, committed to environmental stewardship. We are committed to doing our part to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigate against the potential impacts of climate change.Vulcan recognizes, and is taking steps to address, the physical and transition risks associated with climate change. Carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions from Vulcan\u2019s operations are low: Vulcan is aggregates-focused and does not produce cement. Beginning in 2018, Vulcan chose to voluntarily report GHG emissions via the Carbon Disclosure Project. In 2022, we established interim goals and targets related to Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We also committed to calculating our Scope 3 emissions, which result from activities of assets not owned or controlled by Vulcan but that indirectly impact our value chain. We continue to enhance our GHG emissions tracking and reporting capability in order to report Scope 1 and 2 emissions on an enterprise-wide basis across all lines of business and are concluding the first phase of our Scope 3 GHG emissions inventory project, which focuses on building our Scope 3 upstream emissions inventory and estimating capabilities. The second phase will focus on downstream emissions.MANAGING ENERGY AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCYEnvironmental stewardship \u2014 including our efforts to manage energy, increase efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact \u2014 is embedded into our business strategy and culture. We manage energy use carefully. We routinely conduct energy audits of our operations to identify areas for operational efficiency improvements and energy savings. Some of the opportunities identified during these audits that are being implemented include: replacement of older motors with new ultra-high efficiency motors to power plant processing equipment; improvements in water handling systems to reduce water pumping needed; optimizing process equipment flow to maximize efficiency; use of LED lighting; and optimization of air conditioning and lighting control to reduce energy consumption.We continue to increase the fuel efficiencies of our off-road fleet vehicles. Tier IV machines performed over 57% of the off-road fleet\u2019s work in 2022, which positively impacts all air emissions in addition to having an impact on GHG emissions.Additionally, our Concrete segment has licensed the CarbonCure technology that provides capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide within ready-mixed concrete. The carbon dioxide becomes chemically bound within the concrete matrix and is not released into the air, even when the concrete is recycled following use. This technology also reduces the demand for cement and other cement-related materials which reduces the supply side carbon footprint. The resulting concrete is also stronger than it would have been without use of the technology.Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG reductions will come by means of continuing heavy equipment replacement with higher efficiency models, seeking production efficiencies, and procuring energy from renewable sources. We are confident that there are many more opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint of our operations, distribution and transportation networks, and the projects in which our products are used. An example of an additional opportunity that we are exploring is the installation of battery storage for electricity at multiple locations so that energy can be stored during off peak periods to run the plant equipment, thereby minimizing peak load usage. This has significant implications for the ability of the utility company to meet peak demands and to reduce their use of older power plants that burn coal or oil and emit greater concentrations of GHG emissions.

Compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the time and effort of our employees, as well as financial resources. The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business. For additional information about our risks related to government regulations, see Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors.\u201dOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety; including regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs. These anticipated investments and expenditures are not material to our earnings or competitive position.We have received notices from the EPA or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally, we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share of that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available about the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded at fair value in our financial statements at the time the obligation arises. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.For additional information about environmental matters and reclamation obligations, see Notes 12 and 17, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201dHUMAN CAPITALAs of January 1, 2023, we employed 11,397 people in the United States.

In 2015, we escalated and formalized our efforts in this area with the launch of our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council to promote an open workplace where everyone, regardless of background, race, or other factors, is free to contribute and grow. In 2019, we signed the CEO Action for Diversity & InclusionTM pledge, and we forged a long-term partnership with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to support our future leaders in our communities and on our team. In 2020, we established diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) councils in our divisions to support targeted DE&I opportunities in their local communities. In 2021, we launched Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and included quarterly DE&I topics and updates in our Vulcan University Pop-Up Training Series.Diversity, equity and inclusion is also part of employee training. All employees completed DE&I awareness training in 2016; all new hires complete DE&I awareness training within their first 90 days, and all employees receive additional training every three years.

This list does not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201dECONOMIC/POLITICAL RISKSOur business is dependent on the construction industry and is subject to economic cycles \u2014 Our products are principally sold to the U.S. construction industry. Construction spending is affected by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic shifts, industry cycles, employment levels, inflation and other business, economic and financial factors, any of which could contribute to a downturn in construction activities or spending in Vulcan-served markets. A downturn in Vulcan-served markets, particularly in our top revenue-generating markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our business is exposed to the risks associated with a pandemic, epidemic or other public health emergency, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic \u2014 The COVID-19 pandemic caused governments and businesses around the world to implement strict measures to help control the spread of the virus. The vast majority, if not all, of these measures are no longer in place in the United States. While our industry was deemed essential in every state in which we operate and we continued to operate across our footprint when such measures were in place, our operations, supply chain, customers, and transportation networks were negatively impacted by such measures (including our own) and the health of our employees.  The progression of COVID-19 (which remains highly uncertain) or another pandemic may result in future measures taken by governments and/or businesses (including our own) that could negatively impact our business.Our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure \u2014 Our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal, state and local governments. In 2022, voters in local jurisdictions in California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, among others, approved bond and revenue-raising measures to provide additional resources for transportation projects. In November 2021, the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which included a five year road, bridge and public transportation program reauthorization at record levels, was signed into law. These state and federal highway programs, as well as funding for other aggregates-intensive public infrastructure, will support demand for our products for several years to come. However, given the time to set up new federal programs, varying state and local budgetary situations and the stages of projects, we cannot be entirely assured of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects.We are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships \u2014 We are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA) associated with our aggregates production facilities including those located in British Columbia, Canada; Puerto Cort\u00e9s, Honduras; and Quintana Roo, Mexico. These risks have included, and may in the future include, changes in international trade policies, such as the United States - Mexico - Canada Agreement (USMCA), imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties, arbitrary changes to permits, zoning classifications or operating agreements, or overt acts by foreign governments, including expropriations and other forms of takings of property. Recently, the Mexican government has taken actions that adversely affect our property and operations in that country, including arbitrary shutdown orders to immediately cease underwater quarrying and extraction operations. We continue to vigorously pursue all lawful avenues available to us in order to protect our rights, under both Mexican and international law and intend to resume normal operations in Mexico as soon as permitted.
