{"cik": 1097864, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business   Overview  ON Semiconductor Corporation, together with its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries, which operate under the onsemiTM brand (\"onsemi,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" or the \"Company\"), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1992.   We provide industry leading intelligent power and sensing solutions to help our customers solve challenging problems and create cutting edge products for a better future. Our intelligent power technologies enable the electrification of the automotive industry that allows for lighter and longer-range electric vehicles, empowers efficient fast-charging systems and propels sustainable energy for the highest efficiency solar strings, industrial power and storage systems. Our intelligent power solutions for automotive allows our customers to exceed range targets with lower weight and reduce system cost through efficiency. Our intelligent sensing technologies support the next generation industry allowing for smarter factories and buildings while also enhancing the automotive mobility experience with imaging and depth sensing that make advanced vehicle safety and automated driving systems possible. We believe the evolution of the automotive industry, with advancements in autonomous driving, ADAS, vehicle electrification, and the increase in electronics content for vehicle platforms, is reshaping the boundaries of transportation.  Through sensing integration, we believe our intelligent power solutions achieve superior efficiencies compared to our peers. This integration allows lower temperature operation and reduced cooling requirements while saving costs and minimizing weight. In addition, our power solutions deliver power with less die per module, achieving higher range for a given battery capacity.   Additionally, we serve a broad base of end-user markets, which include communications, computing and consumer.  We are organized into the following three operating and reportable segments: the Power Solutions Group (\"PSG\"), the Advanced Solutions Group (\"ASG\") and the Intelligent Sensing Group (\"ISG\").  Business Strategy Developments  Our primary focus continues to be on profitable revenue growth in our focused end-markets of automotive and industrial infrastructure, as well as obtaining longer-term supply arrangements with strategic end-customers. We are focused on achieving efficiencies in our operating and capital expenditures. We have made significant progress on gross margin and operating margin expansion by focusing our capital allocation on research and development investments and resources to accelerate growth in high-margin products and end-markets. Additionally, we continue to rationalize our product portfolio by moving away from non-differentiated, non-strategic products, which in most cases had lower gross and operating margins. To this effect, in September 2022, we approved an exit plan to wind down QCS, which will further enable us to direct our investments to areas of strategic focus.  During 2022, we completed the divestitures of certain manufacturing facilities. We believe these actions, among others, will allow us to transition from sub-scale factories into a lighter internal fabrication model where our financial performance will be less volatile and not as heavily influenced by our internal manufacturing volumes. We will continue to evaluate our manufacturing footprint in 2023 to align with our investment priorities and corporate strategy. Our goal is to reduce volatility in our gross margins and maximize return on our manufacturing investments with the intention of having our product strategy drive our manufacturing footprint and capital investments. In 2023, our focus will be on ramping up manufacturing at our recently acquired East Fishkill, New York fabrication (\"EFK\") facility, as well as investing to expand our facilities in the Czech Republic, Hudson, New Hampshire, and South Korea to increase our SiC manufacturing capabilities to meet the growing demand for our SiC-based solutions.  See Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information related to our acquisition and divestiture activity.   Recent Acquisitions  On December 31, 2022, we completed our acquisition of the EFK facility and certain other assets and liabilities from GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc. (\"GFUS\"), which was previously announced in April 2019, for total consideration of   5  5  5   $406.3\u00a0million. In connection with the acquisition agreement, we paid GFUS $100.0\u00a0million and $70.0 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the balance of $236.3\u00a0million paid on January 3, 2023. In addition, in 2019 we paid GFUS a one-time license fee of $30.0 million for certain technology, which has been recognized as an intangible asset subject to amortization. The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination.  On October 28, 2021, we completed our acquisition of GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (\"GTAT\"), a producer of SiC substrates. The purchase price for the acquisition was $434.9 million, which included cash consideration of $424.6 million and effective settlement of pre-acquisition balances (non-cash) of approximately $10.0 million, in exchange for all of the outstanding equity interests of GTAT. We believe the acquisition of GTAT will act as a building block to fuel growth and secure supply of SiC to meet growing customer demand for SiC-based solutions.  Completed Divestitures of Certain Manufacturing Facilities  During 2022, in line with our business strategy, we divested our wafer manufacturing facilities in Oudenaarde, Belgium, South Portland, Maine, Pocatello, Idaho and Niigata, Japan. We agreed to wafer supply agreements with the respective buyers of these facilities to ensure that there is no disruption in our ability to meet customer demand for our products.   See Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.  New Legislation  In August 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act, H.R. 4346 (the \"CHIPS Act\") and the Inflation Reduction Act, H.R. 5376 (the \"IR Act\") were signed into law. Among other things, the CHIPS Act provides various incentives and tax credits to United States companies for research, development, manufacturing and workforce development in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The IR Act introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (\"CAMT\") for certain corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain stock repurchases. The Company is evaluating the provisions of the new laws and the potential impacts to the Company. See Note 4: ''Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Other Developments''' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.   Revenue-Generating Activities  onsemi generates revenue from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors and direct customers. We also generate revenue, to a much lesser extent, from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products, combined with our global manufacturing and logistics network, provides our customers with single source purchasing.  The following table illustrates the product technologies under each of our segments based on our operating strategy: PSGASGISG2022 Revenue (%)50.5%34.1%15.3%Analog productsAnalog productsActuator DriversSiC productsASIC productsCMOS Image SensorsDiscrete productsECL productsImage Signal ProcessorsMOSFET productsFoundry products / servicesLSI productsPower Module productsGate Driver productsSingle Photon Detectors Isolation productsLSI productsSensorsMemory productsStandard Logic productsGate Driver productsStandard Logic products  See Note 3: ''Revenue and Segment Information'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for other information regarding our segments, their revenue and property, plant and equipment and the gross profit derived from each segment.    6  6  6   Products and Technology  The following provides certain information regarding the products and technologies for each of our operating segments.   PSG  PSG offers a wide array of analog, discrete, module and integrated semiconductor products that perform multiple application functions, including power switching, power conversion, signal conditioning, circuit protection, signal amplification and voltage regulation functions. The trends driving growth within our end-user markets are primarily higher power efficiency and power density in power applications, the demand for greater functionality, and faster data transmission rates in all communications. The advancement of existing volt electrical infrastructure, electrification of power train in the form of EV/HEV, higher trench density enabling lower losses in power efficient packages and lower capacitance and integrated signal conditioning products to support faster data transmission rates significantly increase the use of high-power semiconductor solutions. The recent increase in the use of WBG MOSFETs and diodes, including SiC and IGBT, is further expanding the use of semiconductor products.   ASG  ASG designs and develops analog, mixed-signal, advanced logic, ASSPs and ASICs, RF and integrated power solutions for a broad base of end-users in different end-markets.

Our broad range of product offerings delivers excellent pixel performance, sensor functionality and camera systems capabilities in which high quality visual imagery is becoming increasingly important to our customers and their end-users, particularly in automotive and factory automation and in applications powered by AI.   Customers  We sell our products to distributors and direct customers for ultimate use in a variety of end-products in different end-markets. In general, we have maintained long-term relationships with our key customers and our sales agreements are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. During 2022, we entered into a number of long-term supply agreements with certain strategic end-customers, which generally include minimum purchase commitments. Certain of our agreements, subject to our standard terms and conditions, have provisions allowing for termination at any time for convenience by either party.  We generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications. Our standard warranty extends for a period of two years from the date of delivery, except in the case of image sensor products, which are warrantied for one year from the date of delivery. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with our customers, they may cancel orders 120 days prior to shipment for standard products without penalty and, for custom products, prior to shipment, provided they pay onsemi's actual costs incurred as of the date we receive the cancellation notice. The loss of one of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment, and may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.  Distributors  Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 58% of our revenue in 2022, 64% of our revenue in 2021 and 60% of our revenue in 2020. We had one distributor whose revenue accounted for approximately 12% of the total revenue for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022. Our distributors resell our products to contract manufacturers, OEMs among other companies. Sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns.    7  7  7   Direct Customers  Sales to direct customers, accounted for approximately 42% of our revenue in 2022, 36% of our revenue in 2021 and 40% of our revenue in 2020. Large multi-nationals and selected regional OEMs, which are significant in specific markets, form our core direct customers. Generally, these customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our warranty.  For additional information regarding agreements with our customers, see \"Markets,\" \"Resources\" and \"Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and Note 2: ''Significant Accounting Policies'' under the heading \"Revenue Recognition\" in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form\u00a010-K.   Markets  Product Development  onsemi is focused on innovation to create intelligent power and sensing technologies that solve the most challenging customer problems.

Because some of our components include functionality that in some cases may be integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully-customized ICs, as well as customers who develop their own IC products. See \"Risk Factors\u2014Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.  Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. The semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. The following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments:  PSG  Our competitive strengths include our core competencies of leading-edge fabrication technologies, micro and module packaging expertise, breadth of product line and IP portfolio, high quality cost effective manufacturing and supply chain management, which ensures supply to our customers. Our commitment to continual innovation allows us to provide an ever broader range of semiconductor solutions to our customers who differentiate in power density and power efficiency, the key performance characteristics driving our markets.  The principal methods of competition in our discrete, module and integrated semiconductor products are through new products and package innovations enabling enhanced performance over existing products. Of particular importance are our intelligent power technologies based on silicon and SiC wide band gap technologies, which we use to design, manufacture, and deliver to our customers as bare die, packaged discrete solutions or power module solutions. In addition to our power technologies, we believe our integrated circuit, signal and protection technologies have significant performance advantages over our competition. PSG\u2019s primary competitors include: Infineon Technologies AG (\"Infineon\"), STMicroelectronics N.V. (\"STMicroelectronics\"), Wolfspeed Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated (\"TI\") and Nexperia BV.  ASG \u00a0 ASG principally competes on design experience, manufacturing capability, depth and quality of IP, ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle, longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel. Our competitive position with respect to the above basis is enhanced by long-standing relationships with leading direct customers. Our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields and availability of supply, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. Competitors for certain of ASG's products and solutions include: Infineon, NXP Semiconductors N.V. (\"NXP\"), STMicroelectronics and TI. ISG  ISG differentiates itself from the competition through deep technical knowledge and close customer relationships to drive leading edge sensing performance for both human and machine vision applications. ISG has significant imaging experience and was one of the earliest to commercialize CMOS active pixel sensors and introduce CMOS technology in many of our markets. ISG has leveraged this expertise into market leading positions in automotive and industrial applications, which allows us to offer technical and end-user applications knowledge to help customers develop innovative sensing solutions across a broad range of end-user needs.   Competitors for certain of ISG's products and solutions include: Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Omnivision Technologies Inc.  Sales, Marketing and Distribution  We have global distribution centers in China, the Philippines and Singapore. Global and regional distribution channels further support our customers' needs for quick response and service. We offer efficient, cost-effective global applications support from our technical information centers and solution engineering centers, allowing for applications that are developed in one region of   9  9  9   the world to be instantaneously available throughout all other regions.  Backlog  Our sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are booked as far as 52 weeks in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our customers, in each case scheduled to be shipped in the current or future period. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times.  \u00a0 In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Historically, a significant portion of our backlog was cancellable, however, our current agreements, including orders subject to minimum purchase commitments under our longer-term supply arrangements, are not subject to cancellation, unless otherwise mutually agreed.    Resources  Raw Materials  Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, SiC wafers, laminate substrates, gold, copper, lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases as well as other production supplies used in our manufacturing processes. We seek to obtain our raw materials and supplies in a timely, planned manner from our suppliers to allow for our manufacturing cycle to align with the timing of our customer demands. However, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors beyond our control, including any caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises.     10  10  10   Manufacturing and Design Operations  We currently have domestic design operations in Arizona, California, Idaho, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah and Virginia. We also have foreign design operations in Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Romania, Singapore, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. In October 2022, we ceased operations at our design locations in Australia and Russia as part of the exit plan to wind down QCS. We operate front-end wafer fabrication facilities in the Czech Republic, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the United States and back-end assembly and test site facilities in Canada, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to these front-end and back-end manufacturing operations, our facility in Hudson, New Hampshire manufactures SiC crystal boules and our facility in Ro\u017enov pod Radho\u0161t\u011bm, Czech Republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities.

For additional information regarding acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.     11  11  11   All of our manufacturing facilities are fully owned and operated by us, except our assembly and test operations facility located in Leshan, China, which is owned by Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Limited, a joint venture company in which we own 80% of the outstanding equity interests (\"Leshan\"). The financial and operating results of Leshan have been consolidated in our financial statements. Our joint venture partner is Leshan Radio Company Ltd. (\"Leshan Radio\"), is formerly a state-owned enterprise. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement between us and Leshan Radio, requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. Each request represents a purchase commitment, provided that any shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity) in lieu of satisfying the commitment. We purchased 80% of Leshan's production capacity in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80% of Leshan's expected production capacity in 2023.  We use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These manufacturers collectively accounted for approximately 43% of our total manufacturing input costs in 2022, 37% in 2021 and 33% in 2020.  For information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations, see \"Risk Factors \u2014 Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights \u00a0 We market our products under worldwide trademarks including the ON Semiconductor, ON, onsemi, and various product names and logos, and, in the United States and internationally, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and non-disclosure agreements and licensing agreements to protect our IP. We acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of IP, including patents and patent applications, in connection with our acquisitions, and we have numerous United States and foreign patents issued, allowed and pending. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we held patents with expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2043, and none of the patents that expire in the next three years are expected to materially affect our business. We do not consider our business substantially dependent on any single onsemi patent. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our IP rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other IP rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate.   For information regarding risks associated with intellectual property, see \"Risk Factors \u2014 Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Intellectual Property\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.   Seasonality  We believe our business today is driven more by content gains within applications and secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality, as was the case historically. Our 2022 results were positively influenced by macroeconomic factors including a better-than-expected demand and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic along with our efforts focused on price increases, better utilization, product diversification and content gains. We could again experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or macroeconomic conditions. For information regarding risks associated with the cyclicality and seasonality of our business, see \"Risk Factors\u2014Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

We have organization-level and overall metrics to monitor for diverse director-level and above employees, diverse new hires and diverse promotions. Our Human Resources organization and the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, through its charter, provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workflow equity and workplace inclusion.   Compensation, Benefits, Health, Safety and Wellness  Our compensation philosophy is focused on delivering competitive compensation with total rewards based on corporate affordability in a way that enables attraction, retention, and recognition of performance delivered in an equitable manner. We provide our employees and their families with access to flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that secure them during events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being. We use a combination of total rewards and other programs (which vary by region and salary grade) to attract and retain our employees, including: annual performance bonuses; stock awards, including an employee stock purchase plan; retirement support; healthcare and insurance benefits; business travel and disability insurance; health savings and flexible spending accounts; flexible work schedules, vacation and paid time off; parental leave; paid counseling assistance; backup child and adult care; education assistance; and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers.  Career Growth and Development  We invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving employee motivation, performance and improving retention. Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We have established a leadership pathway model as a tool for employees to practice and apply learning as part of their development.  Turnover  We monitor employee turnover rates by region and globally. The average tenure of our employees is approximately seven years and approximately one-fifth of our employees have been employed by us for more than 10 years. We believe our compensation philosophy along with the career growth and development opportunities promotes longer employee tenure and reduces voluntary turnover.
