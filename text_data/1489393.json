Business and Properties.  OVERVIEW LyondellBasell Industries N.V. is a global, independent chemical company and was incorporated, as a Naamloze Vennootschap, under Dutch law on October\u00a015, 2009. Unless otherwise indicated, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cLyondellBasell\u201d are used in this report to refer to the businesses of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  We participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines. Our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals. Our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics. Our plastic products are used in large volumes as well as smaller specialty applications. Our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging, home furnishings, automotive components, paints and coatings. Our refining business consists of our Houston refinery, which processes crude oil into refined products such as gasoline and distillates. We also develop and license chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufacture and sell polyolefin catalysts. Our financial performance is influenced by the supply and demand for our products, the cost and availability of feedstocks and commodity products, global and regional production capacity, our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs. We have a strong operational focus and, as a producer of large volume commodities, continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe, reliable and low-cost operations in all our businesses. We purchase large quantities of natural gas, electricity and steam which we use as energy to fuel our facilities and purchase large quantities of natural gas liquids and crude oil derivatives which we use as feedstocks. The relatively low cost of natural gas-derived raw materials in the U.S. versus the global cost of crude oil-derived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our North American operations.   SEGMENTS We manage our operations through six operating segments. Our reportable segments are: \u2022Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas (\u201cO&P-Americas\u201d). Our O&P-Americas segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene. \u2022Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International (\u201cO&P-EAI\u201d). Our O&P-EAI segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene. \u2022Intermediates and Derivatives (\u201cI&D\u201d). Our I&D segment produces and markets propylene oxide and its derivatives; oxyfuels and related products; and intermediate chemicals, such as styrene monomer, acetyls, ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol. \u2022Advanced Polymer Solutions (\u201cAPS\u201d). Our APS segment produces and markets compounding and solutions, such as polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics, masterbatches, engineered composites, colors and powders, and advanced polymers, which includes Catalloy and polybutene-1. \u2022Refining. Our Refining segment refines heavy, high-sulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the U.S. Gulf Coast into refined products, including gasoline and distillates. \u2022Technology. Our Technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts. 4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents Financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in Note\u00a020 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be found under \u201cDescription of Properties.\u201d No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020.  Olefins and Polyolefins Segments Generally We are one of the leading worldwide producers of olefins and polyethylene (\u201cPE\u201d) and we are the world\u2019s second largest producer of polypropylene (\u201cPP\u201d). We manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments, O&P-Americas and O&P-EAI. Olefins\u00a0& Co-products\u2014Ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for PE and many other chemicals and plastics. Ethylene is produced by steam cracking hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, butane and naphtha. This production results in co-products such as aromatics and other olefins, including propylene and butadiene. Ethylene and its co-products are fundamental to many parts of the economy, including the production of consumer products, packaging, housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods. Olefins & co-products sales accounted for approximately 9%, 11% and 9% of our consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020. Polyolefins\u2014Polyolefins such as PE and PP are polymers derived from olefins including ethylene and propylene. Polyolefins are the most widely used thermoplastics in the world and are found in applications and products that enhance the everyday quality of life. Our products are used in consumer, automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials. Polyethylene\u2014We produce high density polyethylene (\u201cHDPE\u201d), low density polyethylene (\u201cLDPE\u201d) and linear low-density polyethylene (\u201cLLDPE\u201d). PE sales accounted for approximately 19%, 22% and 21% of our consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Polypropylene\u2014We produce PP homopolymers and copolymers. PP sales accounted for approximately 13%, 17% and 16% of our consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas Segment Overview\u2014Our O&P-Americas segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene. Sales\u00a0& Marketing / Customers\u2014Most of the ethylene we produce is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of PE and other derivatives, with the balance sold to third party customers, primarily under multi-year contracts. We use all the propylene we produce in the production of PP, propylene oxide and other derivatives of those products. We also purchase propylene from third parties. In addition to purchases of propylene, we purchase ethylene for resale, when necessary, to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels. Volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period and are typically most significant during extended outages of our own production, such as during planned maintenance. However, purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits, except to the extent that they replace our lower-cost production. We also consume PP in our PP compounding business, which is included in our APS segment. 5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Most of the ethylene and propylene production from our Channelview, Corpus Christi and La Porte, Texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system, which has connections to numerous U.S. Gulf Coast consumers. This pipeline system extends from Corpus Christi to Mont Belvieu, Texas. In addition, exchange agreements with other ethylene and co-products producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system. Some ethylene is shipped by railcar from our Clinton, Iowa facility to our Morris, Illinois facility and some is shipped directly to customers. Propylene from Clinton and Morris is generally shipped by marine vessel, barge, railcar or truck. Our PP and PE production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis. We have sales offices in various locations in North America and our polyolefins are primarily transported in North America by railcar or truck. Export sales are primarily to customers in Latin America, with sales to Asia expected to increase in the coming years as global supply and demand balances shift.  Joint Venture Relationships\u2014We have a 50% interest in Louisiana Integrated PolyEthylene JV LLC (\u201cLouisiana Joint Venture\u201d) which provides us with capacity of approximately 770 thousand tons of ethylene and 445 thousand tons of low density and linear-low density PE production per year. We operate the joint venture assets and market the polyethylene off-take for all partners through our global sales team. We also participate in a joint venture in Mexico, which provides us with capacity of approximately 290 thousand tons of PP production per year. We do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture. The capacities are based on our percentage ownership of the joint venture\u2019s total capacity. Raw Materials\u2014Raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost to produce ethylene and its co-products. The primary raw materials used in our Americas olefin facilities are natural gas liquids (\u201cNGLs\u201d) and heavy liquids. Heavy liquids include crude oil-based naphtha and other refined products, as well as condensate, a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production. NGLs include ethane, propane and butane. The use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of significant volumes of co-products such as propylene, butadiene and benzene, as well as gasoline blending components, while the use of NGLs results in the production of fewer co-products. Our ability to pass on raw material price increases to our customers is dependent on market-driven demand for olefins and polyolefins. Sales prices for products sold in the spot market are determined by market forces. Our contract prices are influenced by product supply and demand conditions, spot prices, indices published in industry publications and, in some instances, cost recovery formulas. Technological advances for extracting shale-based oil and gas have led to an increased supply of NGLs, providing a cost advantage over heavy liquids, particularly in the U.S. A plant\u2019s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally provides an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities. Our Americas facilities can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or NGLs. We estimate that in the U.S. we can produce up to approximately 90% of our total ethylene output using NGLs. Changes in the raw material feedstock mix utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products. We believe our raw material flexibility in the U.S. is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its co-products. Industry Dynamics / Competition\u2014With respect to olefins and polyolefins, competition is based on price and, to a lesser extent, on product quality, product delivery, reliability of supply, product performance and customer service. Profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins, but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers, which may intensify due to, among other things, the addition of new capacity. In general, demand is a function of economic growth, including the regional dynamics that underlie global growth trends. We compete in North America with other large marketers and producers, including global chemical companies, chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers. 6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of joint ventures, we believe as of December\u00a031, 2022, we were: \u2022the third largest producer of ethylene in North America, with ethylene capacity of 6.2 million tons per year; \u2022the third largest producer of PE in North America with capacity of 4.1 million tons per year; and \u2022the second largest producer of PP in North America, with capacity of 1.9 million tons per year, including approximately 280 thousand tons of Catalloy capacity reported within our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.  Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International Segment Overview\u2014Our O&P-EAI segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene. Sales\u00a0& Marketing / Customers\u2014Our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polyolefins, and we purchase additional ethylene as needed to meet our production needs. Our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of PP and propylene oxide and derivatives of those products, and we regularly purchase propylene from third parties because our internal needs exceed our internal production. With respect to PP and PE, our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distributors. Our polyolefins are primarily transported in Europe by railcar or truck. Our regional sales offices are in various locations, including The Netherlands, Hong Kong, China, India and the United Arab Emirates. We also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in Europe and Asia. Our joint ventures described below typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently, and we typically operate as their agent for all or a portion of their exports. Joint Venture Relationships\u2014We participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in Saudi Arabia, China, Poland, South Korea, Thailand and The Netherlands. We do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures, nor do we have operational control. These joint ventures provide us with additional annual production capacity of approximately 1.6 million tons of PP, approximately 1.2 million tons of olefins and approximately 770 thousand tons of PE. These capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures\u2019 total capacities. Our 50% joint venture in Quality Circular Polymers (\u201cQCP\u201d), located in The Netherlands, uses mechanical recycling to transform post-consumer plastic waste into high-quality polymers that can be used to make new products. The QCP plants, located in The Netherlands and Belgium, are capable of converting consumer waste into 55 thousand tons of recycled polypropylene and recycled high-density polyethylene annually. We generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our Technology segment. Some of our joint ventures are able to source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders. Raw Materials\u2014Raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of olefins and co-products. The primary raw material used in our European olefin facilities is naphtha; however, we also have the capability to displace up to half of our European assets naphtha needs with other feedstocks, such as liquified petroleum gases. We have flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices for both feedstocks and products change. The principal raw materials used in the production of polyolefins are propylene and ethylene. In Europe, we have the capacity to produce approximately 60% of the propylene requirements for our European PP production and all of the ethylene requirements for our European PE production. Propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally acquired pursuant to long-term contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand for olefins and polyolefins. In general, the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces, including the impacts of foreign exchange rates relative to the pricing of the underlying raw materials, most of which are priced in U.S. dollars. There can be a lag between raw material price changes and contract product price changes that will cause volatility in our product margins. Industry Dynamics / Competition\u2014With respect to olefins and polyolefins, competition is based on price, product quality, product delivery, reliability of supply, product performance and customer service. We compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and divisions of large oil companies. The petrochemical market has been affected by the price volatility of naphtha, the primary feedstock for olefins in the region. Based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures, we believe as of December\u00a031, 2022, we were: \u2022the fifth largest producer of ethylene in Europe with an ethylene capacity of 1.9 million tons per year; \u2022the largest producer of PE in Europe with 2.1 million tons per year of capacity; and \u2022the largest producer of PP in Europe with 2.7 million tons per year of capacity, including approximately 280 thousand tons of Catalloy capacity reported within our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.  Intermediates and Derivatives Segment Overview\u2014Our I&D segment produces and markets propylene oxide (\u201cPO\u201d) and its derivatives, oxyfuels and related products, and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer (\u201cSM\u201d), acetyls, and ethylene oxides and derivatives. PO and Derivatives\u2014We produce PO through two distinct technologies, one of which yields tertiary butyl alcohol (\u201cTBA\u201d) as the co-product and the other of which yields SM as the co-product. The two technologies are mutually exclusive with dedicated assets for manufacturing either PO/TBA or PO/SM. PO is an intermediate commodity chemical and is a precursor of polyols, propylene glycol, propylene glycol ethers and butanediol. PO and derivatives are used in a variety of durable and consumable items with key applications such as polyurethanes used for insulation, automotive/furniture cushioning, coatings, surfactants, synthetic resins and several other household usages. We constructed a world-scale PO/TBA plant in Houston, Texas with start-up activities on track for the first quarter of 2023, for a total cost of approximately $3.7 billion. This plant has the capacity to produce 470 thousand tons of PO and 1.0 million tons of TBA per year. Oxyfuels and Related Products\u2014We produce two distinct ether-based oxyfuels, methyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d) and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cETBE\u201d). These oxyfuels are produced by converting the TBA co-product of PO into isobutylene and reacting with methanol or ethanol to produce either MTBE or ETBE.\u00a0Both are used as high-octane gasoline components that help gasoline burn cleaner and reduce automobile emissions. Other TBA derivatives, which we refer to as \u201cC4 chemicals,\u201d are largely used to make synthetic rubber and other gasoline additives. Intermediate Chemicals\u2014We produce other commodity chemicals that utilize ethylene as a key component feedstock, including SM, acetyls and ethylene oxide derivatives. SM is utilized in various applications such as plastics, expandable polystyrene for packaging, foam cups and containers, insulation products and durables and engineering resins. Our acetyls products comprise methanol, glacial acetic acid (\u201cGAA\u201d) and vinyl acetate monomer (\u201cVAM\u201d). Natural gas (methane) is the feedstock for methanol, some of which is converted to GAA, and a portion of the GAA is reacted with ethylene to create VAM.\u00a0VAM is an intermediate chemical used in fabric or wood treatments, pigments, coatings, films and adhesives. Ethylene oxide is an intermediate chemical that is used to produce ethylene glycol, glycol ethers and other derivatives. Ethylene oxide and its derivatives are used in the production of polyester, antifreeze fluids, solvents and other chemical products. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Sales\u00a0& Marketing / Customers\u2014We sell our PO and derivatives through multi-year sales and processing agreements as well as spot sales. Some of our sales agreements have cost plus pricing terms. PO and derivatives are transported by barge, marine vessel, pipeline, railcar and tank truck. We sell our oxyfuels and related products under market and cost-based sales agreements and in the spot market. Oxyfuels are transported by barge, marine vessel and tank truck and are used as octane blending components worldwide outside of the U.S. due to their blending characteristics and emission benefits. C4 chemicals, such as high-purity isobutylene, are sold to producers of synthetic rubber and other chemical products primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and are transported by railcar, tank truck, pipeline and marine shipments. The sales of oxyfuels and related products accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated revenues in 2022 and 8% of consolidated revenues in each of 2021 and 2020.  Intermediate chemicals are shipped by barge, marine vessel, pipeline, railcar and tank truck. SM is sold globally into regions such as North America, Europe, Asia and South America export markets through spot sales and commercial contracts.\u00a0Within acetyls, methanol is consumed internally to make GAA, used as a feedstock for oxyfuels and related products and also sold directly into the merchant commercial market. GAA is converted with ethylene to produce VAM which is sold worldwide under multi-year commercial contracts and on a spot basis. Sales of our PO and derivatives, oxyfuels and related products, and intermediate chemicals are made by our marketing and sales personnel, and also through distributors in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. Joint Venture Relationships\u2014We have two PO joint ventures with Covestro AG, one in the U.S. and one in Europe. We operate all production facilities for the PO joint ventures. Covestro\u2019s interest in the U.S. PO joint ventures represents ownership of an in-kind portion of the PO production of 680 thousand tons per year. We take, in-kind, the remaining PO production and all co-product production. Covestro also has the right to 50% of the PO and SM production of our European PO joint venture. Our proportional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 160 thousand tons of PO and approximately 340 thousand tons of SM. We do not share marketing or product sales with Covestro under either of these PO joint ventures. We also have two joint venture manufacturing relationships in China with China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (\u201cSinopec\u201d). The first joint venture provides us with production capacity of approximately 50 thousand tons of PO per year. The second joint venture, which began production in January 2022, provides us with annual production capacity of approximately 140 thousand tons of PO and 300 thousand tons of SM. These capacities are based on our operational share of the joint ventures\u2019 total capacities. We market our share of the joint ventures production in the Chinese market. Raw Materials\u2014The cost of raw materials is the largest component of total production cost for PO, its co-products and its derivatives. Propylene, isobutane or mixed butane, ethylene and benzene are the primary raw materials used in the production of PO and its co-products. The market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as supply and demand for the raw materials. In the U.S., we obtain a large portion of our propylene, benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of PO and its co-products from our O&P-Americas segment and to a lesser extent from third parties. Raw materials for the non-U.S. production of PO and its co-products are obtained from our O&P-EAI segment and from third parties. We consume a significant portion of our internally produced PO in the production of PO derivatives. The raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at market-based prices from numerous suppliers in the U.S. and Europe with which we have established contractual relationships, as well as in the spot market. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents For the production of oxyfuels, we purchase our ethanol feedstock requirements from third parties, and obtain our methanol from both internal production and external sources. Carbon monoxide and methanol are the primary raw materials required for the production of GAA. We source carbon monoxide from internal production, which can be complemented by purchases from external sources as needed. The methanol required for our downstream production of acetyls is internally sourced from our methanol plants in La Porte, Texas, and Channelview, Texas. Natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol. In addition to ethylene, acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of VAM. We obtain all our requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production. Historically, we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce VAM. Industry Dynamics / Competition\u2014With respect to product competition, the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors, including product quality, price, reliability of supply, technical support, customer service and potential substitute materials. Profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition, which may intensify due to, among other things, new industry capacity and industry outages. Demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative bio-based methodologies. Our major worldwide competitors include other multinational chemical and refining companies as well as some regional marketers and producers. Based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures, we believe as of December\u00a031, 2022, we were: \u2022the second largest producer of PO worldwide; and \u2022the second largest producer of oxyfuels worldwide.  Advanced Polymer Solutions Segment Overview\u2014Our APS segment produces and markets compounding and solutions, such as polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics, masterbatches, colors and powders, engineered composites and advanced polymers, which include Catalloy and polybutene-1 polyolefin resins. In the first quarter of 2023, our Catalloy and polybutene-1 products, previously reflected in our APS segment, will be transferred to and reflected in our O&P-Americas and O&P-EAI segments.  Compounding and Solutions\u2014Our polypropylene compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are largely focused on automotive applications. Engineered plastics and engineered composites add value for more specialized high-performance applications used across a variety of industries. Masterbatches are compounds that provide differentiated properties when combined with commodity plastics used in packaging, agriculture and durable goods applications. Specialty powders are largely used to mold toys, industrial tanks and sporting goods such as kayaks. Performance colors provide powdered, pelletized and liquid color concentrates for the plastics industry. Advanced Polymers\u2014Catalloy and polybutene-1 are unique polymers that can be used within the segment for downstream compounding or can be sold as raw materials to third parties. Catalloy is a line of differentiated propylene-based polymers that add value in packaging applications and construction materials such as the white membranes used in the commercial roofing market. Polybutene-1 is used in both specialty piping and packaging applications. Sales & Marketing / Customers\u2014Our products are sold through our global sales organization to a broad base of established customers and distributors. These products are transported to our customers primarily by either truck or bulk rail. The sales of compounding and solutions products accounted for approximately 8%, 9% and 12% of our consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Joint Venture Relationships\u2014We participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Thailand. We hold majority interests and have operational control of the joint ventures in Indonesia. We do not hold majority interests in any of the remaining joint ventures, nor do we have operational control. These ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 70 thousand tons of compounding and solutions. These capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures\u2019 total capacities.  Raw Materials\u2014The principal materials used in the production of our compounding and solutions products are polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, nylon and titanium dioxide. Raw materials required for the production of our compounding and solutions products are obtained from our wholly owned or joint venture facilities and from a number of major plastic resin producers or other suppliers at market-based prices. The principal raw materials used in the production of advanced polymers are ethylene, propylene and butene-1. Ethylene and propylene requirements that are not produced internally and externally supplied butene-1 are acquired through long-term contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases. Our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand. In general, the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces. Industry Dynamics / Competition\u2014With respect to product competition, the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors, including product development, price, product quality, product delivery, reliability of supply, product performance and customer service. We compete with regional and multinational marketers and producers of plastic resins and compounds. As polypropylene compounds are largely utilized in the automotive industry, we are also exposed to the volatility of this industry, which has significantly decreased since 2019. Based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures, we believe as of December 31, 2022, we were the largest global producer of polypropylene compounds.   Refining Segment Overview\u2014The primary products of our Refining segment are refined products made from heavy, high-sulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the U.S. Gulf Coast. These refined products include gasoline and distillates. Sales\u00a0& Marketing / Customers\u2014The Houston refinery\u2019s products are primarily sold in bulk to other refiners, marketers, distributors and wholesalers at market-related prices. Most of the Houston refinery\u2019s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market. The Houston refinery\u2019s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties. The sales of refined products accounted for approximately 22% of our consolidated revenues in 2022 and 16% of consolidated revenues in each of 2021 and 2020. Raw Materials\u2014Our Houston refinery, which is located on the Houston Ship Channel in Houston, Texas, has a crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268 thousand barrels per day on a calendar day basis (normal operating basis), or approximately 292 thousand barrels per day on a stream day basis (maximum achievable over a 24-hour period). The Houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy, high-sulfur crude oil. This crude oil is more viscous and denser than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals, making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other high-value fuel products. As a result, high-sulfur crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light, low-sulfur crude oil. U.S. production is predominantly light sweet crude and much of the heavy crude has generally been imported from Canada, Mexico and other global producers, which has at times been subject to supply disruptions. We purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the Houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers, generally with terms varying from three months to one year. 11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents Industry Dynamics / Competition\u2014Our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies, refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners. Based on published data, as of January 2022, there were 130 operable crude oil refineries in the U.S., and total U.S. refinery capacity was approximately 18\u00a0million barrels per day. During 2022, the Houston refinery processed an average of approximately 238\u00a0thousand barrels per day of heavy crude oil. Our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality. Supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing. We compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications. Competition is based on price and location. The markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical due to supply and demand fundamentals and changing crude oil and refined product prices. Crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events, the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand. Prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and short-term factors such as weather and driving patterns, as well as by longer term issues such as the economy, environmental concerns, energy conservation and alternative fuels. Industry fuel products supply is dependent on short-term industry operating capabilities and on long-term refining capacity.  A crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of major refined products. The Houston refinery generally tracks the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread, which represents the difference between the current month U.S. Gulf Coast price of two barrels of Maya crude oil as set by Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos and one barrel each of U.S. Gulf Coast Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygen Blending Gasoline and of U.S. Gulf Coast Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel. While these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the Houston refinery and similarly configured refineries, there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general, such as the value of refinery by-products, which influence operating results. Refinery by-products are products other than gasoline and distillates that represent about one-third of the total product volume, and include coke, sulfur, and lighter materials such as NGLs and crude olefins streams. The cost of Renewable Identification Numbers (\u201cRINs\u201d), which are renewable fuel credits mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d), can also affect profitability. In April 2022 we announced our decision to cease operation of our Houston refinery no later than the end of 2023 after determining that exiting the refining business is our best strategic and financial path forward. Our exit of the refining business progresses our greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emission reduction goals, and the site\u2019s prime location gives us more options for advancing our future strategic objectives, including circularity. In the interim, we will continue serving the fuels market.  Technology Segment Overview\u2014Our Technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts. We market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations. Over the past three years, approximately 20% to 25% of our catalyst sales were sold internally to other segments. Our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology, with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity. In addition to the basic license agreement, a range of services can also be provided, including project assistance, training, assistance in starting up the plant and ongoing technical support after start-up. We may also offer marketing and sales services. In addition, licensees may continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process, generally under long-term catalyst supply agreements with us. Research and Development\u2014Our research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) activities are designed to improve our existing products and processes, and discover and commercialize new materials, catalysts and processes. These activities focus on product and application development, process development, catalyst development and fundamental polyolefin-focused research. 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents In 2022, 2021 and 2020, our R&D expenditures were $124 million, $124 million and $113\u00a0million, respectively. A portion of these expenses are related to technical support and customer service and are allocated to the other business segments. In 2022, 2021, and 2020 approximately 45% of all R&D costs were allocated to business segments other than Technology.   GENERAL  Intellectual Property We maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the U.S. and other countries. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we owned approximately 6,000 patents and patent applications worldwide. Our patents and trade secrets cover our processes, products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position, particularly with regard to PO, intermediate chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers and our process technologies. While we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages, we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent, trade secret or trademark. Some of our production capacity operates under licenses from third parties.  Environmental Most of our operations are affected by national, state, regional and local environmental laws. Matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors; Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings; Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Notes 2 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters. We incurred capital expenditures of $194 million in 2022 for health, safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs, and estimate such expenditures to be approximately $325 million in 2023 and $300 million in 2024. While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance, including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change, cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position in the near term. While there can be no assurance that physical impacts to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future, we do not believe these impacts are material in the near term.  Sustainability LyondellBasell has established sustainability goals focusing on three key areas: ending plastic waste, addressing climate change and advancing a thriving society. One of our sustainability goals is to produce and market at least two million metric tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers annually by 2030, which represents approximately 20% of our 2022 global sales of polyethylene and polypropylene. Since 2019, we have produced and marketed products with more than 175,000 metric tons of recycled and renewable content. In December 2022 we announced more ambitious climate reduction goals, increasing our 2030 GHG emissions reduction target for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from 30% to 42%, relative to a 2020 baseline. In addition, we established a 2030 scope 3 GHG emissions reduction target of 30%, relative to a 2020 baseline, to align with science-based guidance. As we progress in our efforts to achieve our goal to produce and market two million metric tons of recycled and renewable-based products, the corresponding increases in recycling rates will positively impact scope 3 emissions. We expect the emissions reductions we will get from accomplishing this goal to be incremental to the plans we currently have to reduce our scope 3 emissions by 30% by 2030. We estimate approximately 1 million metric tons of scope 3 reductions coming from achieving our circularity ambition. 13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents As announced in April 2022, we are planning to close our Houston refinery by the end of December 2023. This is expected to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by more than 3 million metric tons annually and scope 3 emissions by approximately 40 million metric tons annually. Certain GHG emissions reduction initiatives planned for implementation by 2030 are expected to begin in the near-term as we plan to leverage existing asset turnaround schedules for our largest sites. In 2024, our Wesseling site in Germany is planning implementation of process heat recovery projects, electrification of a large process turbine and optimization of steam demand, including phasing out the use of coal, reducing scope 1 emissions by 150 thousand metric tons annually when compared to the average for 2019 and 2020. In 2025, at our Channelview site in Texas we plan to optimize heated equipment through advanced digitization, efficiency improvements and fuel management. Our previously announced goal to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from global operations by 2050 remains unchanged. Our ambition to achieve net zero by 2050 will need to be enabled by the development and deployment of new technology, including those related to cracker electrification, the use of hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and carbon utilization, across our manufacturing footprint. We also aim to secure at least 50% of our global electricity from renewable sources by 2030. As of February 2023, we have executed eight power purchase agreements, achieving over half of our 2030 target. These agreements will generate over 2.6 million megawatt hours of renewable electricity annually and reduce our scope 2 emissions by nearly 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions.  To achieve our targets, we expect capital spending in the future will include investments to support lowering emissions in our operations. We also anticipate incurring costs for environmental compliance, including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change. We expect capital spending to support these ambitions will represent approximately 15% of total capital expenditures over the next two years. While many of the GHG emissions reduction projects are still in the early stages of development, we will evaluate, pursue and prioritize our GHG emission investments based on a rate of return for the project.  Human Capital Our success as a company is tied to the passion, knowledge and talent of our global team. To achieve our vision of being the best operated and most valued company in the industry, we must attract top performers and equip them with the tools needed to continuously grow and leverage their potential.  Our Code of Conduct sets out our expectations on topics such as respecting fellow employees, anti-corruption, conflicts of interest, trade compliance, anti-trust and competition law, insider trading, sanctions, misconduct and political donations. It is available in seventeen languages on our company website. New employees are trained on the Code of Conduct and all employees receive annual refresher training. We also have a human rights policy that establishes our standards for workforce health and safety; prevention of discrimination, harassment and retaliation; diversity and inclusion; workplace security; working conditions and fair wages; freedom of association; freely chosen employment; and child labor protections. Safety, Employee Health and Well-Being\u2014We are committed to providing a safe workplace, free from recognized hazards, and we comply with all applicable health and safety laws and recognized standards. GoalZERO is our commitment to operating safely and with a goal of zero incidents, zero injuries and zero accidents. We cultivate a GoalZERO mindset with clear standards, regular communication, training, and targeted campaigns and events, including our annual Global Safety Day. Workplace Flexibility\u2014We continued to support workplace flexibility in 2022 as a result of feedback we received from employees. Based in part on data from employee surveys, we enhanced our workplace flexibility initiative in early 2023 by offering up to three remote days per work week. These changes have helped to attract and retain employees. We will continue to study the effectiveness of this policy and will make changes, where necessary, to support business needs. 14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents Global Talent Development and Engagement\u2014To prepare our key individuals for advancement to larger roles, we tripled participation in our executive mentoring and peer learning programs. In addition, we launched a new program in partnership with external consultants to help diverse employees advance their leadership skills. Approximately 83% of our openings in leadership roles were filled by internal talent.   Demographics\u2014As of December 31, 2022 we had approximately 19,300 employees. Our employee demographics, excluding temporary employees, consisted of the following:  U.S. Underrepresented population (\u201cURP\u201d) is based on reporting for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), and includes employees who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, Asian or Pacific Islander, Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or two or more races. Employees who self-identify as White or Caucasian are considered U.S. Non-Underrepresented. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion\u2014DEI remained a key focus in 2022. Our efforts reflect a holistic, multi-year strategy to improve representation, ensure fairness, and increase visibility and accountability to leadership.  Diversity (Representation)\u2014The percentage of diverse employees on our Executive Committee, which reports directly to our CEO, increased from 18% in 2021 to 33% in 2022, and as of February 2023, has increased to 40%. Of the ten members on our Executive Committee, four are women, and together, our CEO and Executive Committee represent six different nationalities. This increase brings us closer to our long-term goals of achieving gender parity in global senior leadership. We are also committed to increasing the number of underrepresented senior leaders in the U.S. to reflect the general population ratio by 2032. To meet these targets, we have set short-term goals to increase the number of female senior leaders globally and the number of underrepresented senior leaders in the U.S. by 50% by 2027, relative to a 2022 baseline. These ambitious goals demonstrate our commitment to having a diverse group of company leaders. To achieve these goals, we focused on enhancing our hiring, promotion and retention practices. With respect to hiring, we expanded our existing senior-level hiring practices to a larger group of positions. These practices include broader recruiting efforts, diverse interview panels and candidate slates, standardized interview questions and hiring-manager training. With respect to promotions, we launched a new program to help diverse employees advance their leadership skills. We also continued to develop and improve our internal talent programs. Through these efforts, we promoted 16% more women in 2022 than in 2021. Indeed, increased promotions of women were the main reason the number of women in senior leadership globally increased by 1% to 22% in 2022.  15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents While we are making significant efforts, our progress towards our goals in 2022 was negatively impacted by increased attrition of both women and URP leaders. Despite increased hiring and promotions of URP employees, the number of URP senior leaders in the U.S. decreased by 1% from 2021 to 18% in 2022. We continue to analyze retention issues to understand attrition drivers and to enhance our employee engagement efforts. Other factors impacting our results were the challenging external talent market and the addition of new senior leadership roles due to the Company\u2019s growth initiatives. We recognize that building talent pipelines and transforming culture takes time, and we remain committed to frequently assessing outcomes and developing programs that will advance these goals. Equity (Fairness)\u2014For the second consecutive year, we completed a pay equity review and performance analysis. Our pay equity review compared pay for like jobs and specifically focused on base pay for gender (globally) and ethnicity (U.S. only). Consistent with 2021 findings, the review reflected that pay is generally administered fairly with a small number of exceptions that should be remediated by the second quarter of 2023. We also confirmed that performance appraisals are generally administered fairly. Both of these annual review processes are now embedded in our HR processes.  The Company also implemented several practices to advance pay equity, including:  \u2022Ensuring that job offers are based on the role, market competitiveness, and a candidate's level of proficiency and experience and not based on a candidate\u2019s historical compensation; \u2022Modifying promotion practices to ensure pay fairness is applied consistently for internal candidates compared to external hires;  \u2022Helping line managers conduct an internal equity review for their employees and, when necessary, making compensation adjustments; and  \u2022Establishing a consistent framework for recognizing and retaining employees.  Finally, we conducted stakeholder workshops to strengthen our approach to pay equity and provide increased transparency to employees about pay practices. Inclusion (Belonging)\u2014We advanced our inclusion efforts by increasing the number of global employee networks from four to six, building a global diverse network of employees championing inclusion. Executive leaders serve as active sponsors for each network, and about 15% of our global workforce has joined at least one of our employee networks. We have network members present at 92% of our global sites, with 47% of members residing outside of the U.S. and 28% joining as allies of underrepresented groups. Network programming is strongly tied to career development and business and community impact, including engagement in strategy development activities with executives in 2022. 16 16 16  Table of Contents Table of Contents INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS  Our executive officers as of February\u00a023, 2023 were as follows:  Name and AgeSignificant ExperiencePeter Vanacker, 56Chief Executive Officer since May 2022.
