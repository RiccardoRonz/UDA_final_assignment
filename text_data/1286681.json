{"cik": 1286681, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business. \u00a0 Overview  \u00a0 Domino\u2019s is the largest pizza company in the world with more than 19,800 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of January 1, 2023, and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. Founded in 1960, we are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large worldwide network of franchise owners and U.S. Company-owned stores through both the delivery and carryout service models. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 99% of Domino\u2019s global stores owned and operated by our independent franchisees as of January 1, 2023. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the Domino\u2019s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us. \u00a0 The Domino\u2019s business model is straightforward: Domino\u2019s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. \u00a0 Domino\u2019s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. Royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the Domino\u2019s\u00ae brand marks. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations primarily in the U.S. and Canada and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the United States. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino\u2019s Pizza\u00ae brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino\u2019s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. \u00a0 The Domino\u2019s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. We believe we have a proven business model for success, which includes leading with technology, service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale, which has historically driven strong returns for our shareholders. \u00a0 Our History  \u00a0 We have been selling quality, affordable food through both the carryout and delivery service models to our customers since 1960. We became \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967. Over the last 60 years, we have built Domino\u2019s into one of the most widely-recognized consumer brands in the world. We believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand.  \u00a0 Emphasis on technological innovation helped us achieve approximately two-thirds of all global retail sales in 2022 from digital channels. In the U.S., we have developed several innovative ordering platforms, including those for Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter and more.  Since 1998, the Company has been structured with a leveraged balance sheet and has completed a number of recapitalization transactions. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had $5.02 billion in total debt, which includes debt resulting from its recapitalization transactions completed in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 (the \u201c2021 Recapitalization,\u201d \u201c2019 Recapitalization,\u201d \u201c2018 Recapitalization,\u201d \u201c2017 Recapitalization\u201d and the \u201c2015 Recapitalization,\u201d respectively, and collectively, the \u201c2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 Recapitalizations\u201d). \u00a0 4 \u00a0 Our Industry \u00a0 The U.S. QSR pizza category is large and fragmented. From 2017 through 2022, the U.S. QSR pizza category has grown from $36.4 billion to $40.7 billion. It is the second-largest category within the $320.3 billion U.S. QSR sector. The U.S. QSR pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery, dine-in and carryout, with carryout and delivery comprising the two largest segments. \u00a0 In the U.S., we compete in the delivery and carryout segments of the pizza industry, and we are the dollar market share leader for delivery and carryout among pizza QSRs. Delivery segment dollars of $17.3 billion in 2022 (up from $13.6 billion in 2017) account for approximately 43% of total U.S. consumer spend at pizza QSRs. The four industry leaders, including Domino\u2019s, account for approximately 60% of U.S. pizza delivery, based on reported consumer spending, with the remaining dollars going to regional chains and independent establishments. From 2017 to 2022, the carryout segment grew from $16.4 billion to $18.9 billion. The four industry leaders, including Domino\u2019s, account for approximately 50% of the U.S. carryout segment. (Source: The NPD Group/CREST\u00ae, year ending December 2022). \u00a0 In contrast to the U.S., international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped, with only Domino\u2019s and two other competitors having a significant global presence. We believe that demand for pizza delivery and pizza carryout is large and growing throughout the world, driven by international consumers\u2019 increasing emphasis on convenience, and our proven success of 40 years of conducting business abroad. \u00a0 Our Competition \u00a0 The global pizza delivery and carryout segments, as well as the broader QSR sector, are highly competitive. In the U.S., we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains Pizza Hut\u00ae, Papa John\u2019s\u00ae and Little Caesars Pizza\u00ae. Internationally, we compete primarily with Pizza Hut\u00ae, Papa John\u2019s\u00ae and country-specific national, regional and local pizzerias. We generally compete on the basis of product quality, location, image, service, technology, convenience and price. Our business and those of our competitors can be affected by changes in consumer tastes, economic and health conditions, demographic trends, marketing, advertising, pricing and consumers\u2019 disposable income. We also compete with other food, food delivery and order and delivery aggregation companies, which have continued to grow in size and scale in recent years. We compete not only for customers, but also for management and hourly employees, including store team members, drivers and qualified franchisees, as well as suitable real estate sites. \u00a0 Our Customers \u00a0 Our business is not dependent upon a single retail customer or small group of customers, including franchisees. No customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020. As of January 1, 2023, our largest franchisee based on store count, Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises (DMP: ASX), operated 3,751 stores in 13 international markets, and accounted for 19% of our total store count. Revenues from this master franchisee accounted for 1.7% of our consolidated revenues in 2022. Our international franchise segment only requires a modest amount of general and administrative expenses to support its markets and does not have a cost of sales component. Therefore, the vast majority of these royalty revenues result in profits to us. \u00a0 Our Menu \u00a0 We offer a menu designed to present an attractive, quality offering to customers, while keeping it simple enough to minimize operational complexity and expedite order-taking and food preparation. Our basic menu features pizza products with varying sizes and crust types. Our typical store also offers oven-baked sandwiches, pasta, boneless chicken and chicken wings, bread and dips side items, desserts and soft drink products. International markets vary toppings by country and culture, such as the Paratha Pizza in India, Durian Pizza in China or the Octopus Bomb Shrimp in Korea, featuring shrimp, octopus, vegetables, feta cream and horseradish sauce. Store Image and Operations \u00a0 We have delivered pizza for over 60 years, and we also emphasize carryout as a significant component of our business. The majority of our U.S. and international stores are constructed in the carryout-friendly Pizza Theater design. Many of these stores offer casual seating and enable customers to watch the preparation of their orders, but do not offer a full-service dine-in experience. As a result, our stores generally do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing. \u00a0 5 \u00a0 Our Business Segments \u00a0 We operate, and report, three business segments: U.S. stores, international franchise and supply chain. \u00a0 U.S. Stores \u00a0 During 2022, our U.S. stores segment accounted for $1.49 billion, or 33%, of our consolidated revenues. Our U.S. stores segment consists primarily of our franchise operations, which consisted of 6,400 franchised stores located in the United States as of January 1, 2023. We also operated a network of 286 U.S. Company-owned stores as of January 1, 2023. \u00a0 Directly operating Domino\u2019s stores contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. We also use our Company-owned stores as test sites for technological innovation and promotions as well as operational improvements. We also use them for training new store managers and operations team members, as well as developing prospective franchisees. While we are primarily a franchised business, we continuously evaluate our mix of U.S. Company-owned and franchised stores. As of January 1, 2023, franchised stores represented approximately 96% of our total store count within our U.S. stores segment. \u00a0 U.S. Franchise Profile \u00a0 As of January 1, 2023, our network of 6,400 U.S. franchise stores was owned and operated by 725 independent U.S. franchisees. Our franchise formula enables franchisees to benefit from our brand recognition with a relatively low initial capital investment. As of January 1, 2023, the average U.S. franchisee owned and operated approximately nine stores and had been in our franchise system for over 17 years. Additionally, 22 of our U.S. franchisees operated more than 50 stores (including our largest U.S. franchisee who operated 162 stores) and 204 of our U.S. franchisees each operated one store as of January 1, 2023.  \u00a0 We apply rigorous standards to prospective U.S. franchisees. We generally require them to manage a store for at least one year and graduate from our franchise management school program before being granted the right to franchise. This enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a long-term agreement. Substantially all of our independent U.S. franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other in-store positions, which we believe offers advantages in terms of familiarity with our business and store operations. In addition, we generally restrict the ability of U.S. franchisees to be involved in other businesses, which we believe helps focus our franchisees\u2019 attention on operating their stores. We believe these characteristics and standards are largely unique within the franchise industry and have resulted in qualified and focused franchisees operating Domino\u2019s stores. We maintain a productive relationship with our independent franchise owners through regional franchise teams, distributing materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and using franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees. We consider our relationship with our U.S. franchisees to be good. \u00a0 U.S. Franchise Agreements \u00a0 We enter into franchise agreements with U.S. franchisees under which the franchisee is generally granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years, with an ability to renew for an additional term of ten years. We had a franchise agreement renewal rate of approximately 99% in 2022. Under the current standard franchise agreement, we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchised store. Each franchisee is generally required to pay a 5.5% royalty fee on sales, as well as certain technology fees. In certain instances, we will collect lower rates based on certain incentives. \u00a0 Our stores in the United States currently contribute 6% of their sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns (subject, in certain instances, to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers). These funds are administered by Domino\u2019s National Advertising Fund Inc. (\u201cDNAF\u201d), our consolidated not-for-profit advertising subsidiary. The funds are primarily used to purchase media for advertising, and also to support market research, field communications, public relations, commercial production, talent payments and other activities to promote the Domino\u2019s brand. In addition to the national and market-level advertising contributions, U.S. stores generally spend additional funds on local store marketing activities.  \u00a0 We have the contractual right, subject to state law, to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a franchisee\u2019s failure to adhere to the Company\u2019s franchise agreement, failure to make required payments or failure to adhere to specified Company policies and standards. \u00a0 \u00a0 6 \u00a0 International Franchise \u00a0 During 2022, our international franchise segment accounted for $295.0 million, or 6%, of our consolidated revenues. This segment is comprised of a network of franchised stores in over 90 international markets. As of January 1, 2023, we had 13,194 international franchise stores. The principal sources of revenues from those operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchised stores, as well as certain technology fees. \u00a0 Our international franchisees employ our basic standard operating model and adapt it to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the U.S. Currently, the vast majority of our international stores operate under master franchise agreements.  \u00a0 We believe that Domino\u2019s appeals to potential international franchisees because of our recognized brand name and technological leadership, the moderate capital expenditures required to open and operate the stores and the system\u2019s desirable store-level profitability. Stores in seven of our ten largest international markets in terms of store count are operated by master franchise companies that are publicly traded on stock exchanges as noted in the below table. The following table shows our store count as of January 1, 2023 in our ten largest international markets, which accounted for approximately 63% of our international stores as of that date. \u00a0 Market \u00a0 Number of stores \u00a0 India (JUBLFOOD: NS) \u00a0 \u00a0 1,758 \u00a0 United Kingdom (DOM: L) \u00a0 \u00a0 1,197 \u00a0 Japan (DMP: ASX) \u00a0 \u00a0 957 \u00a0 Mexico (ALSEA: MX) \u00a0 \u00a0 842 \u00a0 Australia (DMP: ASX) \u00a0 \u00a0 756 \u00a0 Turkey (DPEU: L) \u00a0 \u00a0 650 \u00a0 China \u00a0 \u00a0 589 \u00a0 Canada \u00a0 \u00a0 585 \u00a0 France (DMP: ASX) \u00a0 \u00a0 487 \u00a0 South Korea \u00a0 \u00a0 480 \u00a0 \u00a0 International Franchisee Profile \u00a0 The vast majority of our markets outside of the U.S. are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries. In a few select markets, we franchise directly to individual store operators. Prospective master franchisees are required to possess local market knowledge to establish and develop Domino\u2019s stores, with the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites, as well as expertise in local laws, customs, culture and consumer behavior. We also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans. We consider our relationship with our international franchisees to be good. \u00a0 International Master Franchise and Other Agreements \u00a0 Our international master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop and sub-franchise stores, and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic areas. Agreements are generally for a term of ten years, with options to renew for additional terms. The agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period. The master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial, one-time franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store. The master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of sales, which varies among international markets and may also differ based on certain incentives and concessions, and averaged approximately 3.0% in 2022. We also have agreements with certain of our international master franchisees with respect to certain technology fees. \u00a0 Supply Chain \u00a0 During 2022, our supply chain segment accounted for $2.75 billion, or 61%, of our consolidated revenues. In the U.S., we operate 22 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers, two thin crust manufacturing facilities, one vegetable processing center and one center providing equipment and supplies to our U.S. and certain international stores. We also operate five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in Canada. We plan to continue investing in supply chain productivity initiatives in the future. Our supply chain segment leases a fleet of more than 1,000 tractors and trailers. Our centers produce fresh dough and purchase, receive, store and deliver quality food and other complementary items to substantially all of our U.S. stores and most of our Canadian franchised stores. We regularly supply over 7,200 stores with various food and supplies. \u00a0 \u00a0 7 \u00a0 We believe our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food, supplies and equipment from us because we offer the most efficient, convenient and cost-effective alternative, while also offering both quality and consistency. Our supply chain segment offers profit-sharing arrangements to U.S. and Canadian franchisees who purchase all of their food for their stores from our centers. These profit-sharing arrangements generally offer participating franchisees and Company-owned stores with 50% (or a higher percentage in the case of Company-owned stores and certain franchisees who operate a larger number of stores) of the pre-tax profit from our supply chain center operations. We believe these arrangements strengthen our ties to and provide aligned benefits with franchisees. \u00a0 Third-Party Suppliers \u00a0 A significant amount of our annual food spend is with suppliers with whom we maintain long-standing partnerships. Our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety. We review and evaluate these partners\u2019 quality assurance programs through (among other actions) on-site visits, third-party audits and product evaluations designed to ensure compliance with our standards. We believe the length and quality of our relationships with third-party suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices. \u00a0 Cheese is our largest food cost. The price we charge to our U.S. franchisees for cheese is formula-based, with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange cheddar block price as the primary component, plus a supply chain markup. As cheese prices fluctuate, our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual supply chain dollar margins remain unchanged. We currently purchase our U.S. pizza cheese from a single supplier. Under our September 2017 agreement which expires in September 2024, our U.S. supplier agreed to provide the Company with an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the Company agreed to purchase all of its U.S. pizza cheese from this supplier. While we expect to meet the terms of this agreement, if we do not, we will be required to repay certain negotiated cost savings as provided in the agreement. The majority of our meat toppings in the U.S. come from a single supplier under a contract that, as extended, expires at the end of February 2023. We are actively negotiating a new contract with this supplier and we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our supply following the expiration of our current extension. We have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for certain uncured breaches. We have entered into a multi-year agreement with Coca-Cola\u00ae for the U.S. This contract, renegotiated in June 2019 and amended in January 2023, provides for Coca-Cola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on December 31, 2023 or at such time as a minimum number of cases of Coca-Cola products are purchased by Domino\u2019s, whichever occurs later.  \u00a0 We believe alternative third-party suppliers are available for all of these referenced products. While we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners, we do not believe such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business. We continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy. \u00a0 We have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or delays in receiving our inventories or products. Prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation, and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to stores. We periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices. We do not engage in speculative transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. \u00a0 Our Strengths \u00a0 Strong Brand Equity \u00a0 We are the largest pizza company in the world and we believe our Domino\u2019s brand is one of the most widely-recognized consumer brands in the world. We are the recognized world leader in pizza delivery and, in the U.S., we are also the market share leader in carryout. We believe consumers associate our brand with the timely delivery of quality, affordable food and technological innovation. Over the past five years, our U.S. franchise and Company-owned stores have invested an estimated $2.6 billion in national, co-operative and local advertising. Our international franchisees also invest significant amounts in advertising efforts in their markets. We continue to reinforce our brand with extensive advertising through various media channels. \u00a0 We are the number one pizza delivery company in the U.S. with approximately 32% share of delivery dollars at pizza QSRs, based on consumer spending data for the year ending December 2022. For the same period, we are also leading in carryout with approximately 19% share of carryout/drive-thru QSR pizza consumer spending (Source: The NPD Group/CREST\u00ae, year ending December 2022). With 6,686 stores located in the U.S., our store delivery areas cover a majority of U.S. households. Our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power, supply chain strength and marketing investments. We believe our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers\u2019 demands for convenience and timely delivery. Outside the U.S., we have significant market share positions in many of the markets in which we compete. \u00a0 8 \u00a0 Strong and Proven Business Model \u00a0 Our business model generates U.S. and international franchise royalties and fees, supply chain revenue and retail sales at Company-owned stores. We have developed this model over our many years of operation, and it is anchored by strong store-level economics, which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and historically has generated strong demand for new stores. Over the past ten years, average U.S. store profitability in the Domino\u2019s system has increased meaningfully, resulting in higher profitability for our franchise owners. Our franchise system, in turn, has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty and fee payments and through supply chain revenues. \u00a0 We developed a cost-efficient store model, characterized by a delivery- and carryout-oriented store design, with moderate capital requirements and a menu of quality, value-oriented and affordable items. At the store level, we believe the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors, who, in many cases, also focus on dine-in or have broader menu offerings. At the supply chain level, we believe we provide quality, good value and consistency for our franchise customers while also driving profits for us, which we share with our franchisees under the profit-sharing arrangements described above. \u00a0 Our menu simplifies and streamlines production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal food items. In addition, our stores, including those in our Pizza Theater image, are generally smaller and less expensive to build, furnish and maintain as compared to many other restaurant concepts, and they create a positive experience for our carryout customers. The combination of this efficient store model and strong sales volume has resulted in strong store-level economics and, we believe, makes Domino\u2019s an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees around the world. We and our franchisees are continuing to focus on growing our global store count. In recent years, we have focused specifically on increasing our presence in our existing markets to provide better service to our customers, including condensing our delivery areas to provide better delivery service and adding locations that are closer to our carryout customers. We call this approach our fortressing strategy. \u00a0 We believe our store financial returns have led to a strong, well-diversified franchise system. This established franchise system has produced strong cash flows and earnings for us, enabling us to invest in the Domino\u2019s brand, stores, technology and supply chain centers, pay dividends, repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and service our debt obligations. \u00a0 Technological Innovation \u00a0 Technological innovation is vital to our brand and our long-term success, and digital ordering is critical to competing in the global pizza and broader QSR industries. Emphasis on technological innovation helped us achieve approximately two-thirds of global retail sales in 2022 from digital channels. In the U.S., we have developed several innovative ordering platforms, including those for Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter and more. We have also added GPS to our Domino\u2019s Tracker, which allows customers to monitor the progress of their food, from the preparation stages to the time it is in the oven to the time it arrives at their doors. \u00a0 Our Piece of the Pie Rewards\u00ae loyalty program is meant to reward customers with a program that is simple to understand and easy to use. Upon signing up for the program, customers become rewards members and can earn points for their orders. When rewards members reach a certain amount of points, they can redeem their points for free pizza. Rewards members may also receive exclusive members-only discounts and bonus offers. We may also occasionally provide additional opportunities for participating customers to benefit under the Piece of the Pie Rewards program.  \u00a0 This improved functionality has been developed to work seamlessly with our Domino\u2019s PULSE\u0099 point-of-sale system. Our Domino\u2019s PULSE system is designed to drive operating efficiencies for our franchisees and our corporate management and assist franchisees in independently managing their business. As of January 1, 2023, Domino\u2019s PULSE is being used in every Company-owned and franchised store in the U.S. and in approximately 79% of our international stores. We believe utilizing Domino\u2019s PULSE with our integrated technology solutions throughout our system provides us with competitive advantages over other concepts. We intend to continue to enhance and grow our online ordering, digital marketing and technological capabilities. \u00a0 \u00a0 9 \u00a0 Product Innovation \u00a0 We believe our core hand-tossed pizza recipe has contributed to long-term growth in customer reorder rates, consumer traffic and increased sales. This recipe is now in use in other markets around the world. Our more than 60 years of innovation have resulted in numerous new product developments. Product innovation is also present in our global markets, where our master franchisees have the ability to recommend products to suit their local market tastes. Products can range from simple to indulgent, including the Cheese Fondue Fire Meat in Japan (cheese, tomato and truffle cream sauce, barbecue pork, bacon and vegetables) and the Saumoneta in France (light cream, potatoes, onions, smoked salmon and dill). Internal Dough Manufacturing and Supply Chain System \u00a0 In addition to generating significant revenues and earnings in the U.S. and Canada, we believe our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products, enhances our relationships with franchisees and leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores. It also allows store managers to focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores and sourcing other ingredients. Many of our international master franchisees also profit from running supply chain businesses in their respective markets. \u00a0 Human Capital \u00a0 As of January 1, 2023, we had approximately 11,000 employees, including approximately 6,600 employees supporting our U.S. Company-owned stores and U.S. franchise operations (our U.S. stores segment), approximately 3,300 employees supporting our U.S. and Canadian supply chain operations (our supply chain segment), approximately 100 employees supporting our international franchise operations (our international franchise segment) and approximately 1,000 corporate employees. Approximately 4,500 of our employees are part-time and approximately 6,500 are full-time equivalent. Our franchisees are independent business owners, so their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included in our employee count. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Purpose and Values \u00a0 We are a purpose-inspired and performance-driven company with exceptional people committed to feeding the power of possible, one pizza at a time. At the heart of our brand is a commitment to a set of values that define our core beliefs on how we run our business, treat our people, support our franchisees and serve our customers. \u00a0 Do the Right Thing: We act with integrity and make disciplined decisions, even when it\u2019s difficult or unpopular. High ethical standards and uncommon honesty are at the heart of how we work together. We are committed to safely and responsibly serving our customers, and to giving back to the communities where we live and work. \u00a0 Put People First: We create an inclusive culture, knowing our people are core to our success. We treat each other with dignity and respect, and we value the differences each team member brings. We strive to be a company where all team members can bring their full selves to work and know that they can belong, contribute and reach their potential. \u00a0 Create Inspired Solutions: We are a company built on entrepreneurship and innovation. We get better every day by having the humility and the courage to embrace and lead change. Together, we unlock our collective potential to be bold and think big. We have a bias for action to solve customer needs in new and relevant ways. \u00a0 Champion our Customers: We deliver on our promises, treating each order and interaction as an opportunity to deepen relationships by delivering great products, services and experiences. We hold ourselves accountable, and if we don\u2019t deliver on a promise, we are committed to making it right. \u00a0 Grow and Win Together: We are not playing a finite game. We are committed to building an enduring brand that outlives any of our individual contributions. We will grow together, deliver exceptional results together, celebrate wins together, have fun together, and leave the Domino\u2019s brand in a better place for those that come after. \u00a0 \u00a0 10 \u00a0 Compensation and Benefits \u00a0 Exceptional people are the core of our business. We are committed to providing competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain great talent, whether in our U.S. Company-owned stores, in our supply chain centers or in our corporate offices. We enable this by benchmarking and analyzing pay and benefits both externally and internally. In recent years, we have made continued investments in frontline team member wage rates in our U.S. Company-owned stores and supply chain centers. We are committed to providing pay equity for all employees. \u00a0 Domino\u2019s offers a comprehensive benefits package to eligible team members, including several benefits designed to promote an inclusive workplace like paid parental leaves, adoption support, discounted childcare tuition, and health plans that are available to dependents, spouses and domestic partners and include fertility and gender transition support. We also offer eligible team members a 401(k) plan, education assistance, access to financial education, a back-up childcare network and access to legal assistance. \u00a0 Beyond basic insurance programs, Domino\u2019s offers other wellness services to help team members participating in our health plan manage and optimize their health. These no-cost programs include smoking cessation, diabetes and hypertension management, at-home physical therapy for such team members, in addition to emotional support through Domino\u2019s team member assistance program for all part-time and full-time team members and their dependents. Additionally, we provide up to 40 hours per year of sick time for all part-time and full-time team members, with no waiting period for our part-time team members who begin accruing sick pay on their first day of hire, and access to an outside wellness platform featuring 4,000+ videos on topics like mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, sleep, and financial well-being. \u00a0 Talent Development and Recruiting \u00a0 Having best-in-class talent across the globe is crucial to all aspects of Domino\u2019s business, brand and long-term success. We are focused on attracting, developing and retaining high-performing, diverse teams and building an inclusive culture that inspires leadership, encourages innovative thinking and supports the development and advancement of all team members. Domino\u2019s team members are empowered to drive their own success through different resources, training, and several development programs, including our G.O.L.D. (Global Operations Leadership Development) Program, our Supply Chain Services Driver Development Program and our Tech Rotation Program. \u00a0 Our success will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores, dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations. In certain periods of 2022, we experienced labor shortages affecting store hours and staffing levels in many of our markets which contributed to lower order counts. To continue to strengthen our ability to attract and retain talent to ensure we have appropriate staffing to operate our stores and supply chain centers, we have launched a new Applicant Tracking System and have made continued investments in frontline team member wage rates in our U.S. Company-owned stores and supply chain centers. On an annual basis, we also review scores for our team member engagement and culture surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for our brand. \u00a0 The opportunity and potential at Domino\u2019s is best represented in a key statistic: substantially all of our U.S. franchisees started as delivery drivers or in other in-store positions. With the vast majority of Domino\u2019s U.S. franchisees developed from within our own system, the opportunity to become a small business owner is a profound and unique aspect of Domino\u2019s culture and strength as a brand. Experienced store managers and other operators can apply for Franchise Management School (\u201cFMS\u201d). At FMS, these operators receive training for a successful transition from store management to store ownership. \u00a0 Inclusion and Diversity Efforts \u00a0 \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d and \u201cPut People First\u201d are two of our core values at Domino\u2019s. From those two values our Inclusion and Diversity mission was launched, and we have been relentless in our commitment to building and strengthening our culture every day. Our mission is to foster a more diverse, highly engaged workforce that sees our Company as the employer of choice and is representative of the communities we serve. We want our team members to feel comfortable bringing their unique experiences and diverse backgrounds to discussions where they can share, learn and listen together enabled by conscious inclusion practices and our leadership competencies. \u00a0 \u00a0 11 \u00a0 Domino\u2019s is focused on building an inclusive culture that welcomes, seeks to understand and values everyone\u2019s whole self. Our Inclusion and Diversity efforts have been crafted with a strategic framework that encompasses three pillars: \u00a0 Workforce \u2013 focused on the diversity of our workforce at all levels of the organization. \u00a0 Workplace \u2013 focused on ensuring that our Company-owned stores, offices and supply chains are inclusive. \u00a0 Marketplace \u2013 focused on ensuring our brand reaches and is relevant to all consumers. As part our workplace initiatives, we provide leadership and funding to support team members in participating in Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d). We currently have ERGs representing the Black, Hispanic and LGBTQ communities, as well as women in the workforce and individuals with disabilities, with potentially more to come based on team member interest. We also make available to our eligible team members several benefits designed to promote an inclusive workplace like paid parental leaves, adoption support, discounted childcare tuition and health plans that are available to dependents, spouses and domestic partners and include fertility and gender transition support. \u00a0 Corporate Stewardship \u00a0 Our vision for stewardship is for Domino\u2019s to deliver the power of possible every day for the communities we serve, our people and the planet. We drafted this inaugural stewardship vision, with notable goals and objectives to drive change in the years and decades to come, and with pillars that ladder up to that vision and our underlying long-term goals. We have continued our efforts to better understand our environmental and social impacts. \u00a0 We engaged outside experts to measure and quantify our environmental footprint, and identify opportunities to improve. With the help of these experts, we have conducted a materiality assessment, connected with key stakeholders inside and outside of the company and developed a baseline report for our carbon, water and land use footprint in the U.S. We have set two significant commitments on greenhouse gas emissions, including a commitment to set and reach Science Based Targets by 2032 and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We also continue to highlight important stewardship topics with consumers, including our recent efforts to promote the ability to recycle pizza boxes throughout the U.S. We also launched a fleet of electric vehicles in 2022 as part of an initiative to solve a business need with a solution that is also good for the planet. \u00a0 Domino\u2019s also has a long history of caring for the communities we serve. Our national philanthropic partner is St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital\u00ae, which is internationally recognized for its pioneering work in finding cures and saving children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases. Through a variety of internal and consumer-based activities, including a national consumer fundraising campaign called St. Jude Thanks and Giving\u00ae, the Domino\u2019s system has contributed $109.2 million to St. Jude since our partnership began in 2004, including raising $13.3 million in 2022. We have committed to a 10-year, $100 million campaign to raise funds to build Domino\u2019s Village at St. Jude, a planned housing complex that will accommodate up to 140 patient families during long-term stays at the hospital. \u00a0 We also support the Domino\u2019s Pizza Partners Foundation (the \u201cPartners Foundation\u201d). Founded in 1986, the mission of the Partners Foundation is \u201cTeam Members Helping Team Members.\u201d Primarily funded by team member and franchise contributions, the Partners Foundation is a separate, not-for-profit organization that has disbursed over $11.3 million over the past five years. The Partners Foundation is committed to meeting the needs of Domino\u2019s team members facing crisis situations, such as fire, illness, natural disasters or other personal tragedies. \u00a0 Additionally, in 2020, Domino\u2019s announced a pledge of $3.0 million to support the Black community in the U.S., including $1.0 million to create the Company\u2019s first Black Franchisee Opportunity Fund. \u00a0 You can find more information about our initiatives and read our 2022 Corporate Stewardship Report, which includes both Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indexed tables, at stewardship.dominos.com. The information included in our Corporate Stewardship Report is not incorporated by reference herein and should not be considered a part of this document. \u00a0 12 \u00a0 Additional Disclosures \u00a0 Working Capital \u00a0 Information about the Company\u2019s working capital is included in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7. \u00a0 Government Regulation \u00a0 We, along with our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of our business. Each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located. In connection with maintaining our stores, we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations. Our supply chain facilities are also licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal, state and local health and fire codes.  \u00a0 We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. Labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain personnel. A significant number of both our and our franchisees\u2019 food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage, and past increases in the minimum wage have increased labor costs, as would future increases. \u00a0 We are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees, and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities. We are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on the net worth of our subsidiary, Domino\u2019s Pizza Franchising LLC, and experience. We believe our franchise disclosure document, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises. \u00a0 Internationally, our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that are often similar to those affecting our U.S. stores, including laws and regulations concerning franchises, labor, health, sanitation and safety. Our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment, and laws regulating foreign investment. We believe our international disclosure statements, franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises. \u00a0 Privacy and Data Protection \u00a0 We are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations both in the U.S. and globally. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increase in attention given to privacy and data protection issues with the potential to directly affect our business. This includes recently-enacted laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally requiring notification to individuals and government authorities of security breaches involving certain categories of personal information. Any changes in privacy or data protection laws or regulations could also impact our marketing techniques and could change our marketing strategies. We have a privacy policy posted on our website at dominos.com. The security of our financial data, customer information and other personal information is a priority for us. \u00a0 Trademarks \u00a0 We have many registered trademarks and believe that the Domino\u2019s mark and Domino\u2019s Pizza names and logos, in particular, have significant value and are important to our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks. We license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements. \u00a0 \u00a0 13 \u00a0 Environmental Matters \u00a0 We are not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that we would expect to materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations. During 2022, there were no material environmental compliance-related capital expenditures, and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2023. \u00a0 Available Information \u00a0 The Company makes available, free of charge, through its internet website ir.dominos.com, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a), 15(d), or 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
