While we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services and solutions, we focus our investments in two areas of strategic growth: Digital Media. We provide products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content.

Digital Experience. We provide an integrated platform and set of applications and services through Adobe Experience Cloud that enable brands and businesses to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data scientists, developers and executives across the C-suite. The foundation of our offering is Adobe Experience Platform, which provides businesses and brands with an open and extensible system for customer experience management that transforms customer data into robust customer profiles that update in real time and uses insights driven by artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) to enable the delivery of personalized digital experiences across various channels in milliseconds.

Through these tools and services, we help our customers effectively make, manage, monetize and mobilize their content across channels and devices with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop. We believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both of these areas, where our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant, as people seek new ways to create, collaborate and communicate and businesses continue to invest in digital transformation. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue to invest in delivering digital experiences.  SEGMENTS Our business is organized into three reportable segments:  \u2022Digital Media;  \u2022Digital Experience; and  \u2022Publishing and Advertising.  These segments provide Adobe\u2019s senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities further described below, and our legacy products and solutions are contained within the third segment, Publishing and Advertising.  MARKET OVERVIEW This overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2023 and beyond for each of our segments. See the section titled \u201cResults of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item\u00a07 titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this report and Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment information. Digital Media Opportunity In today\u2019s digital world, content is fueling the global economy and design and creativity have never been more relevant, providing a significant market opportunity for Adobe in digital media. Everyone has a story to tell, and they need the tools, services and capabilities at their fingertips to tell those stories on an ever-increasing number of canvasses. In a creator economy that is continually expanding, creators are looking for tools to help them easily make and share unique and beautiful content with speed and ease. At the same time, creativity is increasingly a team sport that is redefining productivity, making collaboration even more critical to every company\u2019s success. We believe Adobe is in a strong position to address these trends with innovation that will democratize creativity, empowering individuals to create wherever inspiration strikes and enabling more effective collaboration between creators and stakeholders. The flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud, a subscription service that allows members to use our creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktop, web and mobile devices. We believe in creativity for all, and Creative Cloud addresses the needs of all content creators, from creative professionals, such as artists, designers, developers, students and administrators, to knowledge workers, marketers, educators, enthusiasts, communicators and  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents consumers. Users can choose between the speed and ease of use of Adobe Express, our task-based, template-first web and mobile application, or the greater power and precision of our flagship Creative Cloud applications. Our customers rely on our products for content creation, photo editing, design, video and animation production, mobile app and gaming development and more. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow by advancing every creative category across devices and the web, expanding content-first, task-based creativity with Adobe Express and 3D and immersive content creation with Substance 3D, enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders and inspiring and empowering the creative community through sharing and monetization.  Our Digital Media segment also includes our Adobe Document Cloud business, a unified, cloud-based document services platform, which integrates Adobe\u2019s pioneering PDF technology with our Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Sign applications to deliver fully digital document workflows. We have the opportunity to continue to accelerate document productivity with Adobe Document Cloud, modernizing how people view, share, collaborate and engage with documents. Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, which reflects the growing role PDF plays across practically every segment of the economy. There are hundreds of millions of users that engage with PDF files on a daily basis, in industries such as legal, financial services and publishing, as well as a broader array of communicators and Acrobat Reader users, who can also use the expanded capabilities provided by our Acrobat applications and the document services platform found in Document Cloud.  Strategy Our goal for our Digital Media business is to be the leading platform for creativity and digital document solutions, where we offer a range of products and services that allow individuals, teams, small and medium businesses, enterprises and government institutions, including both professionals and enthusiasts, to design and deliver content seamlessly. With content creation, consumption, collaboration and monetization happening across all surfaces and media types, we aim to deliver new ways to unleash creativity and accelerate document productivity, and we believe this is an area of significant opportunity for growth through expansion of our customer base. We aim to achieve this by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led growth to make our creative applications more frictionless and accessible, and meeting customer needs holistically to increase the value of our products. We continue to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud, so that our customers can connect with everything and everyone they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. We are empowering anyone, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit, schedule and share content quickly and easily using Adobe Express, which employs powerful capabilities from our flagship products like Photoshop, Premiere and Acrobat to deliver the best of Adobe to customers at any level. We are continuing to integrate collaboration capabilities into our applications and workflows such as our native integration of Frame.io\u2019s review and approval capabilities into Premiere Pro and After Effects. Similarly, our new Share for Review feature in Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign provides an efficient way for creators to seamlessly request, manage and view feedback from stakeholders that makes exporting to other formats, emailing files, tracking versions and keeping track feedback across different channels obsolete. We are expanding the capabilities of Creative Cloud on the web with improvements to our public beta web versions of Photoshop and Illustrator, which allow subscribers to edit and review their files directly in their browser. Other new features and solutions introduced in our products include Substance 3D Modeler, a new desktop and VR application for creating 3D objects; AI-powered quick actions and social media content scheduling in Adobe Express; direct video upload from select cameras to Frame.io with Camera to Cloud; and improved AI-powered neural filters and content-aware editing in Photoshop and Lightroom. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into our other applications.  We are pursuing new ways to inspire, empower and connect the creative community, such as through our Create Change series, our creative residency program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance. We also offer a range of other creative tools and services, including libraries of creative assets, such as Adobe Stock and Adobe Fonts; mobile-first apps, such as Lightroom Mobile; and Creative Cloud Libraries, a central place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under \u201cPrincipal Products and Services.\u201d In our Creative Cloud business, we employ our product-led growth strategy to minimize the friction of customer interactions and drive positive product experiences, which results in increasing customer adoption, conversion, expansion and loyalty. We also continue to employ a pricing strategy, as appropriate, to migrate our customers to higher-value offerings as well as attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and ultimately subscribe. We use a data-driven operating model and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to drive and optimize customer awareness, engagement and licensing of our creative products and services at every stop of the customer journey through our website and across other channels. Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications, through various collections of our individual  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications, such as Adobe Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating model and product-led growth strategy to optimize conversion of our users of free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services help us to further expand our universe of customers beyond creative professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and approval, copywriting, social media marketing or other social content. We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with existing users, attract new customers and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.  In our Adobe Document Cloud business, we expect to drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by continuing to employ our product-led growth strategy, deliver the best PDF experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web\u2019s functionality and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in Acrobat and integrate Adobe Acrobat Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces. We also intend to drive innovation with Adobe Sensei, our cross-platform AI and machine learning technology, to make both new and legacy documents more intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe Acrobat Sign APIs, accelerate Document Cloud adoption through direct sales, and leverage diversified go-to-market motions to reach all segments. With over 50 million searches for PDF-related actions per month, we intend to harness that demand and attract new users to our Document Cloud services through Acrobat web, which allows anyone to quickly access tools to create, edit, convert, sign and compress PDFs through their web browser. As with our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a data-driven operating model to market our Document Cloud solutions and optimize our subscription-based pricing for individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our reach in our key markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business, including our partnerships with Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow and Notarize.  As our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across devices and the web, we are expanding our Document Cloud capabilities to meet this need. Acrobat Reader is available on mobile devices, with many of its standard features available on the go, and features \u201cLiquid Mode\u201d to automatically reformat PDFs for quick navigation and easier consumption on smaller screens. Acrobat is available on the web, delivering quick results for common PDF actions with a single click. Adobe Scan powers mobile devices with scanning capabilities, transforming paper documents into full-featured PDFs. Adobe Acrobat Sign also provides a green alternative to costly, paper-based solutions and offers a modern, convenient solution for customers to digitally manage their documents, automate processes and contract workflows. We believe that by using Adobe Sensei to enhance customer experiences through machine learning and AI and continuing to add new capabilities to our Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Acrobat Sign offerings, we can help our customers continue to migrate away from paper-based processes and adopt our solutions to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process.  Digital Experience Opportunity Digital transformation is a macro trend that affects every business, government and educational institution today\u2014every business is a digital business. Consumers today buy experiences, not just products, and they demand personalized digital experiences that are relevant, engaging, seamless and secure across an ever-expanding range of channels and devices. Business customers increasingly have the same expectations, driving business-to-business (\u201cB2B\u201d) companies to deliver equally engaging and seamless experiences as business-to-consumer (\u201cB2C\u201d) companies and enterprise brands to adopt \u201cbusiness-to-everyone\u201d (\u201cB2E\u201d) mindsets. Delivering the best, personalized experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content across multiple channels in real time and at scale. In turn, executives, including those at the world\u2019s leading brands, are increasingly seeking solutions that enable real-time personalization at scale. Marketing and IT teams are looking for a return on investment to demonstrate the business impact of their transformation initiatives.  Adobe Experience Cloud is powering digital businesses by providing exceptional experiences to their customers via a comprehensive suite of solutions.

We also maintain several strategic partnerships with other technology companies that allow us to increase our market reach.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT A continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing solutions and the development of new solutions due to the speed of technological change that characterizes the software industry. We develop our software internally, as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs  15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.  PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions.

We license our desktop software and mobile apps to users under \u2018click through\u2019 or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication, disclosure and transfer.

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our transition from perpetual-use software licenses to a subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.  HUMAN CAPITAL Our culture is built on the foundation that our people and the way we treat one another promote creativity, innovation and performance, which spur the Company\u2019s success.

To continue to improve employee representation, we have declared a set of aspirational goals for women in leadership positions globally, underrepresented minorities in leadership positions in the United States and overall Black representation.  We have a three-pillar strategy to grow the diversity of our workforce over time, on which we have continued to drive progress during fiscal 2022: \u2022Workforce: We take actions to improve the hiring, retention and promotion of a more diverse workforce to achieve our aspirational goals. In fiscal 2022, we sourced candidates from a variety of conferences and partnerships, such as AfroTech, AdColor, BreakLine, HBCU 20x20 and Management Leadership for Tomorrow.

In fiscal 2022, we launched the Adobe Equity and Advancement Initiative, a multi-faceted grantmaking program to support non-profit organizations, and we continued to invest in our Supplier Diversity program to purchase goods and services from businesses that are certified as majority-owned and operated by underrepresented groups. We invest in analysis and transparency to demonstrate our commitment to fair compensation. We define pay parity as ensuring that employees in the same job and location are paid fairly regardless of their gender or ethnicity. In fiscal 2022, we again achieved global gender pay parity and U.S. URM and non-URM pay parity. We continue to monitor our progress to ensure that we are creating a culture that fairly rewards and recognizes the contributions of all employees. Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, diversity metrics and programs can be found on our website at adobe.com/diversity. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Compensation, Benefits and Wellbeing We offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees\u2019 overall wellbeing. To ensure alignment with our short- and long-term objectives, our compensation programs for all employees include base pay, short-term incentives and opportunities for long-term incentives. We believe this alignment, whether through equity awards issued by Adobe or employee participation in our employee stock purchase plan, provides employee shareholders with meaningfully deeper connections to Adobe and contributes to the Company's long-term success. Our wellbeing and benefit programs focus on four key pillars: physical, emotional, financial and community. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurance, generous time-off and leave and retirement and financial support. We provide emotional wellbeing services through our Employee Assistance Program and a variety of interactive apps. Our wellness reimbursement of up to $600 per year for each eligible employee, lifestyle coaching, global wellbeing speaker series and ergonomic programs help to support employees\u2019 physical and emotional wellbeing. In addition, our financial education and financial wellness coaches offer employees tools and resources to reach their personal financial goals. To build community, we bring together our employees through onsite events, messaging forums and our Employee Networks to share stories and engage with one another. In response to supporting employees after the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate. This includes a hybrid work schedule for our employees and implementing resources and tools for them to be successful, including the global expansion of dependent care programs to help employees balance their work and life responsibilities. We provide up to 20 working days per calendar year of paid time off for employees who cannot work due to circumstances related to pandemic or natural disaster and company-wide global wellbeing days for employees to take a break from work and take care of themselves. Additionally, we introduced \u201cLet\u2019s Talk\u201d and healing sessions to support employees facing challenging circumstances. Future of Work  Digital transformation and the COVID-19 pandemic have fundamentally changed how people work, and we are leaning into digital-first workflows, tools and resources to enable us to be productive, wherever we are. We also believe in the value of people being together\u2014fostering trust, relationships and collaboration and innovation. Over the past year, we have been evolving to a hybrid model, in which employees who are assigned to an office can divide their work between the office and home about half the time. We are actively piloting, testing and iterating our approach to support new ways of working and evolving the employee experience. Growth and Development At Adobe, employees are given the opportunity to drive their own careers.
