{"cik": 12208, "item_1A": "ITEM 1. \u00a0BUSINESS  General  Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (referred to in this report as \u201cBio-Rad,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d) is a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products. Bio-Rad manufactures and supplies the life science research, healthcare, analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify, analyze and purify their components.  We have direct distribution channels in over 35 countries outside the United States through subsidiaries whose focus is sales, customer service and product distribution. In some locations outside and inside these 35 countries, sales efforts are supplemented by distributors and agents.  Description of Business  Business Segments  Bio-Rad operates in two industry segments designated as Life Science and Clinical Diagnostics. Both segments operate worldwide. Our Life Science segment and our Clinical Diagnostics segment generated 48% and 52%, respectively, of our net sales for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022. We generated approximately 41% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022 from the U.S. and approximately 59% from our international locations, with Europe being our largest international region\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.   3 3 3   Life Science Segment Our Life Science segment is at the forefront of discovery, creating advanced tools to answer complex biological questions. These instruments, systems, reagents, and consumables are typically used to separate, purify, characterize, or quantitate biological materials such as cells, proteins, and nucleic acids in the research laboratory or the biopharmaceutical manufacturing and quality control process, for food safety and science education and literacy.  Many of our products are used in established research techniques, biopharmaceutical production processes and food testing regimes. We are focused on the translational research market segment where our products help accelerate the timelines from discovery in the lab to use in the clinic and with patients. We are a leader in the life sciences market and develop, manufacture and market a broad portfolio of many thousands of products that serve a global customer base. We focus on specific segments of the life sciences market in proteomics (the study of proteins), genomics (the study of genes), biopharmaceutical production, cellular biology and food safety. We estimate that the worldwide market that our portfolios can address for products in these selected segments of our addressable markets is approximately $19 billion. Our principal life science customers include universities and medical schools, industrial research organizations, government agencies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, biotechnology researchers, food producers and food testing laboratories.     Clinical Diagnostics Segment Our Clinical Diagnostics segment designs, manufactures, markets and supports test systems, informatics systems, test kits and specialized quality controls that serve clinical laboratories in the global diagnostics market. Our products currently address specific niches within the in vitro diagnostics (IVD) test market, and we seek to focus on the higher margin, higher growth segments of this market.  We supply several thousand products that cover more than 300 clinical diagnostic tests to the IVD test market. We estimate that the worldwide sales for products in the markets we serve is approximately $16\u00a0billion. IVD tests are conducted outside the human body and are used to identify and measure substances in a patient\u2019s tissue, blood or urine. Our products consist of reagents, instruments and software, typically provided to our customers as an integrated package to allow them to generate reproducible test results. Revenue in this business is highly recurring, as laboratories typically standardize test methodologies, which are dependent on a particular supplier\u2019s equipment, reagent and consumable products. An installed base of diagnostic test systems therefore typically creates a recurring source of revenue through the sale of test kits for each sample analyzed on an installed system. Our principal clinical diagnostic customers include hospital laboratories, diagnostic reference laboratories, transfusion laboratories and physician office laboratories.  Raw Materials and Components  We utilize a wide variety of chemicals, biological materials, electronic components, machined metal parts, optical parts, computing and peripheral devices. Most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources, and while we have historically not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies, the impact of COVID-19 on our suppliers' operations has created on-going challenges in procuring materials. For more discussion relating to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the difficulty of securing adequate supplies, please see \u201cItem 1A, Risk Factors\u201d to this Annual Report. In certain instances, we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier. Due to the regulatory environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials.     Patents, Trademarks and Licenses  We own over 2,300 U.S. and international patents and numerous trademarks.\u00a0We also hold licenses under U.S. and foreign patents owned by third parties and pay royalties on the sales of certain products under these licenses. \u00a0In addition, we also receive royalties for licenses of our intellectual property. We view these patents, trademarks and license agreements as valuable assets; however, we believe that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge, technology and special skills rather than our patent, trademark and licensing positions.   4 4 4   Seasonal Operations  Our business is not inherently seasonal. However, the European custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income.  Sales and Marketing  We conduct our worldwide operations through an extensive direct sales force, employing approximately 830 direct sales and sales management personnel around the world. Our sales force typically consists of experienced industry professionals with scientific training, and we maintain a separate specialized sales force for each of our segments.  We believe that this direct sales approach allows us to sell a broader range of our products that creates more brand awareness and long-term relationships with our customers.  We also use a range of sales and marketing intermediaries (SMIs) in our international markets.  The types of SMIs we utilize are distributors, agents, brokers and resellers.  We have programs and policies in place with our SMIs to ensure their compliance with all applicable laws, including adhering to our anti-corruption standards to ensure a transparent sale to our customers.  Our customer base is broad and diversified. Our worldwide customer base includes (1) prominent university and research institutions; (2) hospital, public health and commercial laboratories; (3) other leading diagnostic manufacturers; and (4) leading companies in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries.   Our sales are affected by a number of external factors. For example, a number of our customers, particularly in the Life Science segment, are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding. \u00a0  Most of our international sales are generated by our wholly-owned international subsidiaries and their branch offices. Certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing operations. Bio-Rad\u2019s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general, such as changes in governmental regulations, import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations. \u00a0  Competition  The markets served by our product groups are highly competitive. Our competitors range in size from start-ups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach. We seek to compete primarily in market segments where the technology and efficacy of our products offer customers specific advantages over the competition.  Our Life Science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products due to the breadth of its product lines. Major competitors in this market include Becton Dickinson, GE Biosciences, Merck Millipore and Thermo Fisher Scientific.  We compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications and offering comprehensive solutions. Major competitors for our products in the Clinical Diagnostics segment include Roche, Abbott Laboratories, Siemens, Danaher, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Becton Dickinson, bioM\u00e9rieux, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Tosoh, Immucor and DiaSorin. We compete across a variety of attributes including quality, service and product portfolio.  5 5 5    Research and Development   We conduct extensive research and development activities in all areas of our business. Research and development has played a major role in Bio-Rad\u2019s growth and is expected to continue to do so in the future. Our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products. In our development of new products and applications, we interact with scientific and medical professionals at pharma and bio-pharma companies, universities, hospitals and medical schools, and within our industry. In addition, we regularly invest in companies that are engaged in the development of new technologies that either complement or expand our existing portfolio of products. We have approximately 1,110 employees worldwide focused on research and development, including degreed scientists, engineers, software developers and other technical support staff.  Regulatory Matters  The development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of certain of our products (primarily diagnostic and donor screening products) are subject to regulation in the United States by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and/or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities.\u00a0FDA regulations require that some new products have pre-marketing notification (\u201c510(k)\u201d) or approval (\u201cPMA\u201d or Biologics License Application \u2013 \u201cBLA\u201d) by the FDA and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with FDA\u2019s \u201cgood manufacturing practice\u201d regulations, to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process requires regulatory competence to execute and usually takes four to nine months, but it can take longer. The FDA\u2019s PMA and BLA processes require extensive regulatory competence to execute and may take one to two years.   A clinical trial is generally required to support a PMA or BLA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance or a de novo authorization. Conducting clinical trials is a complex and costly activity and frequently requires the use of outsourced resources that specialize in planning and conducting the clinical trial for the medical device manufacturer.  The European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) has adopted the EU in-vitro Diagnostics Regulation (the \u201cEU IVDR\u201d), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in-vitro diagnostics products (as compared to the predecessor in-vitro Diagnostics Directive (IVDD)), including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems, economic operators and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently marketed in-vitro diagnostics products had until May 2022 to meet the requirements of the EU IVDR, though the EU Council and Parliament signed an amendment that delays certain previously mandated deadlines to allow more time for Notified Body of EU countries to manage the entire portfolio of IVD products on the European market. Bio-Rad's IVD products currently meet the requirements of the EU IVDR.  Our manufacturing facilities, as well as those of certain suppliers, are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies to verify compliance with regulatory requirements. Similar inspections are performed by Notified Bodies to verify compliance to applicable ISO standards (e.g. ISO 13485:2016), requirements under the Medical Device Single Audit Program (\"MDSAP\") applicable to regulatory requirements of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and the U.S. and/or medical device regulations and requirements from the countries in which we distribute product and other specified audits by regulatory authorities. If a regulatory body were to find that we or certain suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations (e.g. recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events), it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, civil penalties, consent decrees, injunctions, criminal prosecution, operating restrictions, partial suspension or shutdown of production, refusal to permit importation or exportation, refusal to grant, or delays in granting, clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals. Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business.   6 6 6    We are also subject to additional regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.  Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products or diagnostic tests using our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly adjusting reimbursements for certain medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or diagnostic tests using our products, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures.  As a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation, we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions. \u00a0  Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern activities such as transportation of goods, emissions to air and discharges to water, as well as handling and disposal practices for solid, hazardous and medical wastes. In addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations, we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and clean-up responsibility for spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate. The environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills, disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties.  These regulatory requirements vary widely among countries.  Human Capital Resources  At Bio-Rad, we consider our employees to be our most valuable asset, and critical to the effective development, manufacture, sale, distribution and servicing of our vast array of products and services. Our employees are essential to satisfying our customers\u2019 needs for products to advance science and healthcare. At December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 8,200 employees, the overwhelming majority of which are full-time employees. Our employees are located throughout the world with roughly 46% in the Americas, 37% in Europe, the Middle-East and Africa, and 17% in Asia Pacific. Our employees work in over 140 locations in 36 different countries around the world.  7 7 7    Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  At Bio-Rad, we recognize that diversity is a strength. Our differences offer new and unique ideas and perspectives to our organization. We foster a work culture that embraces the diverse experience and knowledge of every employee, creating an inclusive culture regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, or nationality. We have been purposeful in our efforts to hire, develop and retain diverse talent as well as in our efforts to create an inclusive culture. We actively encourage employee engagement and regularly solicit feedback regarding job satisfaction, career growth and development, collaboration, empowerment, ethics, and manager effectiveness. We use employee input to help our managers make focused and strategic commitments to improve and sustain engagement in their teams. Bio-Rad requires that all management and employees participate in ongoing training intended to increase awareness of the importance of a diverse and inclusive culture.   Compensation and Benefits  We provide a competitive total rewards program consisting of broad-based salary and bonus plans as well as annual stock grants to management level employees. These programs combine to recognize and reward employees based on individual, group, and overall company performance. We provide competitive health and welfare programs which include medical, dental, vision and life insurance, a 401(k) plan, an employee stock purchase program, local pension plans, profit sharing, employee assistance, child and elder care programs, employee recognition and a host of other localized programs tied to the unique needs of our employees.  Pay equity is an integral part of our compensation strategy. We have established ongoing processes and protocols to help us pay each individual employee appropriately based on the employee's skills, performance, experience, location, market practices, etc., regardless of race, gender and other non-performance related attributes.  Health, Wellness and Safety  The health and welfare of our employees is of the highest importance to Bio-Rad. We prioritize, manage, and carefully track safety performance at all locations globally and integrate sound safety practices in every aspect of our operations. We provide work site hazard evaluations, workplace safety surveys, safety equipment selection, safety program reviews, chemical exposure monitoring, safety training, and disposal of hazardous chemical and infectious waste. In March 2020, we began to implement certain changes in an effort to protect our employees and customers from COVID-related exposures. For example, we implemented social distancing in the workplace, extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for both production and office spaces, and broad work-from-home initiatives for employees in our administrative functions.  In 2021, we instituted a COVID-19 vaccine requirement in the United States to help contribute to a safer workplace. We also continue to require employees to isolate and quarantine when appropriate to protect their fellow workers and deploy rapid COVID-19 testing when appropriate. Throughout the pandemic, essential workers continued to work at our facilities and provide vital service to our customers. Beginning in early 2022 most of the employees in our administrative functions began returning to the office several days each week and we anticipate they will be spending more time on site as pandemic conditions continue to improve. Starting in 2023, we introduced an upgraded and streamlined mental health/Employee Assistance Program solution tailored to the need and preference of employees and families. In addition, we added a fertility benefit giving employees access to a suite of services including pregnancy resources, in vitro fertilization (\u201cIVF\u201d), adoption, donor and surrogate services resources.   Training and Talent Development  We provide training programs for managers and employees to support their growth and development. Our management series of courses cover essential management and leadership learning to provide our managers with the necessary skills and experience needed to more effectively lead and develop their teams. In addition, available courses for employees help them to be more effective at work, enhance interpersonal effectiveness, and help them achieve their full potential. We also support employees\u2019 professional development by providing a reimbursement program for qualified educational expenses.   8 8 8   Investment in Sartorius AG  Sartorius AG (\"Sartorius\") is an international laboratory and process technology provider for the biotech, pharmaceutical, and food industries.
