CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY GOALS We see possibilities to further increase our positive impact in the world. We have identified three focus areas for our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts to drive measurable impact on issues including: protecting our planet, accelerating access to healthcare technology, and advancing ID&E. In fiscal year 2022, we set new performance targets across the following areas: Patient Safety & Product Quality; Inclusion, Diversity & Equity; Climate Stewardship; Product Stewardship; and Access & Innovation. More information about our ESG focus areas, including progress we have made to date toward achieving them, is included in our Integrated Performance Report.(1) (1)The contents of our Integrated Performance Report and our Global Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity Report are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated by reference in the Form 10-K. OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS Public Health Crises The global COVID-19 pandemic, together with the preventative and precautionary measures taken by businesses, communities, and governments, have impacted, and may continue to impact significant aspects of our Company and business, including future procedural volumes, supply constraints, healthcare staffing, and resulting impacts on demand for our products and therapies. If there are significant outbreaks of other contagious diseases or other global public health crises, we may face similar impacts. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Research and Development The markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances and innovations. Constant improvement of existing products and introduction of new products is necessary to maintain market leadership. Our research and development (R&D) efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in the markets we serve to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible. We remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products, and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs. That commitment leads to our initiation and participation in hundreds of clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high. Furthermore, our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future. We have not engaged in significant customer or government-sponsored research. Our R&D activities include improving existing products and therapies, expanding their indications and applications for use, developing new therapies and procedures, and entering into arrangements with third parties to fund the development of certain technologies. We continue to focus on optimizing innovation, improving our R&D productivity, driving growth in emerging markets, generating clinical evidence, and assessing our R&D programs based on their ability to address unmet clinical needs, produce better patient outcomes, and create new standards of care. Intellectual Property and Litigation We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and agreements (non-disclosure and non-competition agreements) to protect our business and proprietary technology. In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents importance to our business; however, we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.  We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Sales and Distribution We sell our medical devices and therapies through a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors globally. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals. Our medical supply products are used primarily in hospitals, surgical centers, and alternate care facilities, such as home care and long-term care facilities, and are marketed to materials managers, group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and integrated delivery networks (IDNs). We often negotiate with GPOs and IDNs, which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities. Our four largest markets are the U.S., Western Europe, China, and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity, as we believe they remain under-penetrated. Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide. To achieve this objective, our marketing and sales teams are organized around physician specialties. This focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to cross-sell complementary products.  We are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales.  Competition, Industry, and Cost Containment We compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances, innovations and scientific discoveries. Our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products. In addition, we face competition from providers of other medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies. Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product corrective actions, physician advisories, safety alerts, results of clinical trials to support superiority claims, and publications about our products, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry. In the current environment of managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, declining reimbursement rates, and national and provincial tender pricing, competitively priced product offerings are essential to our business. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These initiatives put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms. Hospitals, which purchase our technology, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, centralized purchasing, and in some cases, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization. This has created an increased level of price sensitivity among customers for our products. Production and Availability of Raw Materials We manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, due to the U.S. FDA\u2019s manufacturing requirements, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources.  For additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to \u201cItem 2. Properties\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents Government Regulation Our operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA, European regulatory authorities such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom, the Health Products Regulatory Authority in the Republic of Ireland and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Germany, the China National Medical Product Administration (NMPA), and other government agencies inside and outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. Our business is also affected by patient and data privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives, as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations. Product Approval and Monitoring Many countries where we sell products are subjected to approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety, and quality of our products. Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally obtained in one of two primary ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that our medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second, more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval, requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. This process is generally much more time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process. In the E.U., conformity with the marketing authorization requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. The Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017, and it imposes significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements (EU MDR). The regulation provided an implementation period and became effective on May 26, 2021. The European Commission recently extended the implementation period to the end of 2027 for high-risk devices and to the end of 2028 for medium and low risk devices. The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products. Regulations of the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. These agencies review our design and manufacturing processes, labeling, record keeping, and manufacturers\u2019 required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed products. We are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future pre-market approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. For additional information, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" We are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. Trade Regulations The movement of products, services, and investment across borders subjects us to extensive trade regulations. A variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across borders. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import, export and other business activities. We are also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. Some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities, we also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users. If we, or the third parties through which we do business, are not in compliance with applicable import, export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability. Such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business. Anti-Boycott Laws Under U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S. are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the U.S. or between the U.S. and countries outside of the U.S. If we, or certain third  12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability. Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations As a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs, new compliance challenges, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce. Our global operational footprint comes with the obligation for compliance and adherence to individual data security, confidentiality and breach notification laws at the State Level, Federal Level, and International Level. Examples of those laws include, in the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and various State privacy laws that have become effective recently. We are also subject to various other country-specific requirements around the world, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom\u2019s version of the same, and China's Personal information Protection Law (PIPL).  Because the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation, compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities, or withdrawal of noncompliant products from a market. Regulations Governing Reimbursement The delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federally funded healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government\u2019s interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare. Other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services. U.S. federal healthcare laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals or other healthcare fraud. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state Medicaid and other healthcare programs and private third-party payers. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties. Implementation of legislative or regulatory reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.  Environmental Health and Safety Laws We are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials.
