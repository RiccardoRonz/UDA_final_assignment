{"cik": 1637459, "item_1A": "Item 1.  Business.  General We are driving transformation at The Kraft Heinz Company (Nasdaq: KHC), inspired by our Purpose, Let\u2019s Make Life Delicious. Consumers are at the center of everything we do. With 2022 net sales of approximately $26 billion, we are committed to growing our iconic and emerging food and beverage brands on a global scale. We leverage our scale and agility to unleash the full power of Kraft Heinz across a portfolio of six consumer-driven product platforms. As global citizens, we\u2019re dedicated to making a sustainable, ethical impact while helping to feed the world in healthy, responsible ways. On July 2, 2015, through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (\u201cKraft\u201d) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (\u201cHeinz\u201d) (the \u201c2015 Merger\u201d). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company, and H. J. Heinz Company changed its name to Kraft Heinz Foods Company. Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (\u201cBerkshire Hathaway\u201d) and 3G Global Food Holdings, LP (\u201c3G Global Food Holdings\u201d and, together with its affiliates, \u201c3G Capital\u201d), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013 (the \u201c2013 Heinz Acquisition\u201d). We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to years and quarters contained herein pertain to our fiscal years and fiscal quarters. Our 2022 fiscal year was a 53-week period that ended on December 31, 2022, our 2021 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 25, 2021, and our 2020 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 26, 2020. Reportable Segments: In the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North America zone as a result of previously announced organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by streamlining and synergizing our United States and Canada businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. See Note 20, Segment Reporting, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for our geographic financial information by segment. Resources Trademarks and Intellectual Property: Our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets.\u00a0Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Significant trademarks by segment based on net sales in 2022 were: Majority Owned and Licensed TrademarksNorth AmericaKraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Lunchables, Velveeta, Capri Sun*, Maxwell House, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-OInternationalHeinz, ABC, Master, Kraft, Quero, Golden Circle, Wattie\u2019s, Plasmon, Pudliszki \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Used under license. We sell certain products under brands we license from third parties. In 2022, brands used under licenses from third parties included Capri Sun packaged drink pouches for sale in the United States. We also grant certain licenses to third parties to use our intellectual property rights in select jurisdictions. In 2021, in our agreements with an affiliate of Groupe Lactalis (\u201cLactalis\u201d), related to the sale of certain assets in our global cheese business, we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in perpetuity, including perpetual licenses for the Kraft and Velveeta brands for certain cheese products. We also own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses under patents owned by third parties, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business. 1 1 1   Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Raw Materials and Packaging: We manufacture (and contract for the manufacture of) our products from a wide variety of raw materials. We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, soybean and vegetable oils, tomatoes, coffee beans, sugar and other sweeteners, other fruits and vegetables, corn products, wheat products, and potatoes, to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, fiberboard, metals, and cardboard to package our products, and we use electricity, diesel fuel, and natural gas in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. For commodities that we use across many of our product categories, such as corrugated paper and energy, we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition, some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers, including large, international producers and smaller, local, independent sellers. Where appropriate, we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors, such as global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, consumer, industrial, or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative energy, and agricultural programs. In 2022, we continued to experience higher commodity costs and supply chain costs, including procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs, largely due to inflationary pressures. We expect these costs to continue to increase and inflation to remain elevated through 2023. Our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices. Although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. We actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures. Research and Development Our research and development efforts focus on achieving the following four objectives: \u2022product innovations, renovations, and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs, support our environmental and sustainability goals, and drive growth; \u2022world-class and uncompromising food safety, quality, and consistency; \u2022superior, customer-preferred product and package performance; and \u2022continuous process, product, and supply chain optimization. Competition Our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, which continue to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers, large-format retailers, and discounters. Our competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies. We compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete on the basis of product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences. Improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures. Sales Sales and Customers: Our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers, agents, and distributors to chain, wholesale, cooperative, and independent grocery accounts; convenience, value, and club stores; pharmacies and drug stores; mass merchants; foodservice distributors; and institutions, including hotels, restaurants, bakeries, hospitals, health care facilities, and government agencies. Our products are also sold online through various e-commerce platforms and retailers. 2 2 2   We have key customers in different regions around the world. In 2022, the five largest customers in our North America segment accounted for approximately 46% of North America segment net sales and the five largest customers in our International segment accounted for approximately 14% of International segment net sales. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 21% of our net sales in 2022 and approximately 22% of our net sales in each of 2021 and 2020. Both of our segments have sales to Walmart Inc. We manage our sales portfolio through six consumer-driven product platforms. A platform is a lens created for the portfolio based on a grouping of real consumer needs and includes the following for Kraft Heinz: Taste Elevation, Fast Fresh Meals, Easy Meals Made Better, Real Food Snacking, Flavorful Hydration, and Easy Indulgent Desserts. The platforms are modular and configurable by reportable segment and market. Further, each platform is assigned a role within our business to help inform our resource allocation and investment decisions, which are made at the reportable segment level. These roles include: Grow, Energize, and Stabilize. The role of a platform may also vary by reportable segment and market. The platform approach helps us to manage our business efficiently, including the oversight of our various product categories and brands, and transforms the way we plan for our growth. Net Sales by Platform: Net sales by platform as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the periods presented were: December 31, 2022December 25, 2021December 26, 2020Taste Elevation31\u00a0%28\u00a0%26\u00a0%Fast Fresh Meals23\u00a0%25\u00a0%26\u00a0%Easy Meals Made Better20\u00a0%19\u00a0%19\u00a0%Real Food Snacking5\u00a0%7\u00a0%9\u00a0%Flavorful Hydration8\u00a0%7\u00a0%6\u00a0%Easy Indulgent Desserts4\u00a0%4\u00a0%4\u00a0%Other9\u00a0%10\u00a0%10\u00a0% Net Sales by Product Category: The product categories that contributed 10% or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were: December 31, 2022December 25, 2021December 26, 2020Condiments and sauces31\u00a0%28\u00a0%26\u00a0%Cheese and dairy15\u00a0%19\u00a0%20\u00a0%Ambient foods12\u00a0%11\u00a0%11\u00a0%Frozen and chilled foods11\u00a0%10\u00a0%10\u00a0%Meats and seafood10\u00a0%10\u00a0%10\u00a0% Seasonality Although crops constituting certain of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis, the majority of our products are produced throughout the year. Seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products, including holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. While these factors influence our quarterly net sales, operating income/(loss), and cash flows at the product level, unless the timing of such events shift period-over-period (e.g., a shift in Easter timing), this seasonality does not typically have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or segment results. 3 3 3   Government Regulation The manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated. Our business operations, including the production, transportation, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, quality, and safety of our products and their ingredients, and our occupational safety, health, and privacy practices, are subject to various laws and regulations. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also subject to numerous laws and regulations outside of the United States in markets where our products are manufactured, distributed, or sold, including laws and regulations governing food safety, health and safety, anti-corruption, and data privacy. In our business dealings, we are also required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, and various other anti-corruption regulations in the regions in which we operate. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, regulatory regime changes may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts. Environmental Regulation: Our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight regarding environmental matters. Various laws concerning the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations. In the United States, where a significant portion of our business operates, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d). CERCLA imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party. We are involved in a number of active proceedings in the United States under CERCLA (and other state actions under similar legislation) related to certain closed, inactive, or divested operations for which we retain liability.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our general compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and, thus, future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves. Human Capital Management We are driven by our Purpose, our Vision\u2014To sustainably grow by delighting more consumers globally, and our Values\u2014We are consumer obsessed, We dare to do better every day, We champion great people, We demand diversity, We do the right thing, and We own it. We recognize that a strong company culture is vital to our overall success. Our Purpose, Vision, and Values are the foundation upon which our culture is built. They represent the expectations we have for ourselves and the environment we aspire to create for our Company.   Our people are at the heart of who we are at Kraft Heinz. We drive growth through development opportunities, career ownership, and autonomy and recognize and reward outstanding performance at every level, creating a true spirit of meritocracy. We strive to channel our employees\u2019 passion, curiosity, and attitude to make an impact on our future and our legacy by leading as learners, acting as owners, and being change agents. Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d), through the Human Capital and Compensation Committee, oversees our human resources strategy, key policies, and our 2025 diversity, inclusion, and belonging aspirations. Engagement and Retention: We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining diverse, world-class talent and creating an engaging and inclusive culture that embodies our Purpose, Vision, and Values. As of December 31, 2022, Kraft Heinz had approximately 37,000 employees globally. Driven by our Value We champion great people, we support our employees\u2019 health, safety, and professional development and reward outstanding performance at every level. Our compensation, benefits, recognition, and LiveWell programs are designed to attract and engage highly skilled talent, meet individual and family needs, and inspire, celebrate, and engage our people and teams through active listening channels. Guided by our Values, we conduct a global engagement survey annually to provide employees with an opportunity to share anonymous feedback with management across a variety of topic areas. The results, and comments are reviewed by the Board, senior leadership, managers, and human resources to help determine where changes are needed to support our people and teams. 4 4 4   Wellbeing and Safety: Our employees\u2019 health, safety, and wellbeing are a top priority. We establish and administer company-wide policies and processes to protect the health, safety, and security of our employees, subcontractors, and all those who visit our facilities, and to comply with applicable regulations. We review and monitor our performance closely to drive continuous improvement. To help us evaluate how effective our safety efforts are in lowering incidents rates, we use a Total Recordable Incident Rate (\u201cTRIR\u201d). TRIR is a medical incident rate based on the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) record-keeping criteria (injuries per 200,000 hours). Our TRIR globally was 0.53 in 2022 and 0.62 in 2021. Our global LiveWell program addresses physical, emotional, financial, and social health and wellbeing. We champion the LiveWell program\u2019s holistic approach to wellbeing with enhanced programs, including healthcare benefits, disability, and employee assistance initiatives. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging: We live our Value of We demand diversity by focusing on three strategic areas: hiring and growing talent from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, developing inclusive leaders, and tracking and reporting our progress. Our Global Inclusion Council has been established to create strategic accountability for results. It also provides governance and oversight of reporting on diversity efforts and initiatives. The Council is comprised of executive leaders and members of the Board. In 2021, we shared our 2025 diversity, inclusion, and belonging aspirations, which include that 50% of our global management positions be filled by women and 30% of our salaried U.S. employee population identify as people of color. As of December\u00a031, 2022: \u202241% of employees in management positions globally identified as women;  \u202228% of salaried employees in the U.S. identified as people of color; \u202240% of our Executive Leadership Team identified as women; and \u202280% of our Executive Leadership Team identified as people of color. As we work to meet our 2025 aspirations, we are focused on: \u2022Hiring and Growing Talent from Diverse Backgrounds and Perspectives through expanded recruiting partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and training and leveraging artificial intelligence in our hiring process to reduce bias. In addition, our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) offer learning and development opportunities and create a network of support for employees. \u2022Developing Inclusive Leaders through an interactive learning experience for managers on interrupting bias in our Organizational People Review process and their role in creating an inclusive environment. \u2022Tracking and Reporting Our Progress year over year through oversight by the Kraft Heinz Global Inclusion Council. Learning and Development: Through Kraft Heinz Ownerversity, we provide learning and development offerings to employees via live and virtual learning experiences. These offerings enable employees to execute with excellence in their roles, accelerate their learning curves, and grow great careers through continuous learning. With Ownerversity\u2019s targeted platforms, employees can focus on timely and topical development areas including leadership, management excellence, functional capabilities, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. In 2022, our global women\u2019s accelerator program, The WE Network, won a Brandon Hall Gold Award for Best Advance in Leadership Development for Women.  Rewards and Compensation: Our Total Rewards strategy is designed to provide an array of meaningful and flexible programs for our diverse workforce. Total Rewards includes compensation elements of salary and wages and incentives, healthcare, savings and insurance plans, wellbeing plans, employee recognition programs, and other voluntary elected benefits. We aim for global consistency while respecting local market practices. The plans are designed to be market competitive and data-driven to promote our high-performance and results-oriented culture and realize our Purpose to Make Life Delicious for employees and their families.  Ethics and Transparency: The Kraft Heinz Ethics Helpline is available to our partners, suppliers, customers, and consumers to ask questions or report potential violations of various policies and ethical guidelines, including our Code of Conduct, Supplier Guiding Principles, and Global Human Rights Policy.  We report more detailed information regarding our programs and initiatives related to our people and human capital management in our Environmental Social Governance Report (\u201cESG Report\u201d). Our 2022 ESG Report, which provides our progress through 2021, is available on our website at www.kraftheinzcompany.com/esg. The information on our website, including our ESG Report, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). 5 5 5    Information about our Executive Officers The following are our executive officers as of February 11, 2023: Name and TitleAgeBusiness Experience in the Past Five YearsMiguel Patricio,Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board56Chief Executive Officer (since June 2019); Chair of the Board (since May 2022); Director (May 2021 to May 2022); and U.S. Zone President (July 2019 to February 2020).
