Sales by geographic region are included within Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\", \"Results of Operations.\" See Note\u00a023 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding total net sales and total assets by segment, as well as net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region.  SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITION In 2022, no significant portion of the Company's sales was dependent upon a single customer. The markets in which the Company participates compete primarily through technology, range of products and services, performance, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, service and support. The Company provides extensive support, technical services and testing services for its customers, in addition to new product development. The Company believes that its proprietary product and process technologies, robust product and application development pipelines, customer intimacy, global manufacturing capability and local service capability enable it to compete successfully.  DuPont is a multi-industrial company and is subject to competition across all product and service areas. Key competitors include but are not limited to: \u2022Electronics & Industrial: 3M, Element Solutions, Entegris, Henkel, JSR, Merck KGaA, MKS Instruments, Parker Hannifin, and TOK. \u2022Water & Protection: 3M, Honeywell, Hydranautics, Kingspan, Kolan, Lanxess, LG Chem, Owens-Corning, Purolite, Royal DSM, Toray, Teijin, and Yantai.  Against this competitive backdrop, value-in-use is the primary driver of price for the Company\u2019s products, although price is impacted by many factors including, among others, fluctuations in supply and demand, and availability and cost of key manufacturing inputs including raw materials and energy.   SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MAJOR RAW MATERIALS The novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) and its variants continue to adversely impact the broader global economy, including certain of the Company\u2019s suppliers for key raw materials. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread supply chain challenges due to labor disruptions, increased raw material costs and component shortages, namely the semiconductor chip shortage. In addition, logistic challenges are continuing and have caused delays and increased costs. The Company is actively working to mitigate the impact of the widespread supply chain and logistics issues.  DISTRIBUTION  Most products are marketed primarily through the Company's sales organization, although in some regions, more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. The Company has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the Company's brands to customers globally. This network consists of the Company's sales and marketing organization partnering with distributors, independent retailers, cooperatives and agents throughout the world.  BACKLOG  In general, the Company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are typically based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. However, from time to time in limited instances the Company does operate against a backlog for certain products, which has in the past resulted, and in the future may result, from the availability of raw materials from third-party suppliers. Therefore, the Company believes that backlog information is generally not meaningful to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY The Company\u2019s businesses differentially manage their respective intellectual property estates to support Company strategic priorities, which can include leveraging intellectual property within and across product lines.   Trade Secrets: Trade secrets are an important part of the Company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets. When the Company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, the Company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the Company and/or unjust enrichment.  12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents Patents:\u00a0The Company\u00a0applies for and obtains patents in many countries, including the U.S., and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. DuPont\u2019s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company in the aggregate. The Company considers various intellectual property protections and strategic business priorities when deciding whether to apply for or maintain a patent.  The protection afforded by patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country and type of patent protection. The term of these patents is approximately twenty years from the filing date in general, but varies depending on country and type of patent protection. DuPont's significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the Company\u2019s strategic priorities within and across product lines. At December 31, 2022, the Company owned about 14,000\u00a0patents and patent applications globally. Approximately 70% of the Company\u2019s patent estate has a remaining term of more than 5 years.  Trademarks: The Company owns or licenses many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level and/or the product line to product line level. Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected.  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY MATTERS DuPont operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the Company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. For more information see: (1) Environmental Proceedings on page 27, (2) Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 30, (3) Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) DuPont\u2019s purpose is to empower the world with the essential innovations to thrive. The Company operates within four core values of protecting safety and health; respect for people; conduct in accordance with the highest ethical behavior; and protecting the planet. DuPont\u2019s sustainability strategy is focused on driving innovations to create sustainable solutions that help address the most pressing challenges facing society and the planet; enhancing the sustainability of its operations and facilities; and protecting the health and well-being of its employees and communities. In 2019, DuPont announced its 2030 Sustainability Goals, including its Acting on Climate Goal - to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30 percent, measured from a base year of 2019, including sourcing 60 percent of electricity for operations from renewable energy and delivering carbon neutral operations by 2050. Additional information about DuPont's sustainability strategy and 2030 Goals can be found on its website as discussed below and in several areas of this report, including: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 30.  Information about DuPont\u2019s ESG-related policies, programs, initiatives and goals is available under Sustainability in the About Us section of its website. The Company\u2019s 2022 Sustainability Report, which is aligned to the Global Reporting Initiative (\u201cGRI\u201d) Standards: Core option and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\"SASB\") frameworks, includes information based on the businesses and facilities owned and operated by the Company during the calendar year 2021. As such, the 2022 Sustainability Report, and certain other information under Sustainability, does not reflect and has not been adjusted to reflect, among other things, the M&M Divestitures.   The 2022 Sustainability Report includes discussion of the Company\u2019s approach to ESG governance which is overseen by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. In 2022 the Company took further actions to further align its governance and enterprise risk management practices around climate-related risks with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).   Additional corporate governance information, including DuPont\u2019s amended and restated charter, amended and restated bylaws, corporate governance guidelines, Board committee charters, and code of business conduct and ethics, is available under Corporate Governance in the \"For Investors\" section of the Company\u2019s website.   Nothing on the DuPont websites shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents HUMAN CAPITAL Foundational to the Company\u2019s current and future success is its employees, who drive the Company\u2019s strategic vision, manage operations and develop products. The Company focuses significant attention on attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels. Through training and professional development initiatives, promoting a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion, and emphasizing the importance of health, safety and well-being, the Company\u2019s aim is to create an environment that fully supports the needs of its employees providing opportunity for financial and career growth, an inclusive and collegial experience and purpose in doing work that matters. Annually, an enterprise-wide engagement survey is conducted, which provides insight into employee morale and aspects of workplace culture like core values, commitment to ethical behavior, teamwork and employee development.   The Company is committed to creating a high-performance culture built on continual learning to support the strategic needs of its workforce. The professional growth of our people is essential to the growth of our business. Our annual goal process asks employees to not only identify three key goals around business contributions but also and one goal focused on self-development. The Company has prioritized learning and career development opportunities for leaders and all employees. The Company offers a diverse set of training, education and development opportunities, both formally and informally, throughout the year. All employees take part in a mix of on-the-job training and appropriate learning and training opportunities focusing on topics that are the most critical and relevant to each employees\u2019 job function. Employees have the freedom to create meaningful development plans, identify goals, and take steps to achieve them.   The Company believes that diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DE&I\") is central to high employee engagement and seeks to foster an environment where employees can bring their authentic selves to work each day. The more perspectives there are, the more ideas that can be generated, which makes DE&I a driver of innovation, and therefore, integral to the Company\u2019s success. DuPont believes that it can fulfill its purpose with the full commitment, participation, creativity, energy, and cooperative spirit of a diverse workforce. The Company provides its Equal Employment Opportunity Employer Information Report (EEO-1), and other information on its DE&I efforts under Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in the \"About Us\" and \"Sustainability\" sections of its website. Nothing on the DuPont websites shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company is committed to ensuring equal opportunity for growth and fulfillment for its employees and to positively impacting communities in which it operates. The Company\u2019s employee-led Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) help cultivate a culture of acceptance where employees feel not only accepted, but celebrated, at every level. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has eight corporate ERGs - DuPont Black Employees Network, DuPont Asian Group, DuPont Pride Network, DuPont Latin Network, DuPont Women\u2019s Network, DuPont Veterans Network, DuPont Early Career Network, and DuPont Persons with Disabilities and Allies - all of which have regional and local chapters through the Company. Each group is actively sponsored by senior leadership, helping model and promote inclusive values and behaviors. The Company also offers DE&I tools and resources to educate managers and employees on cultivating and maintaining an inclusive work environment. These resources include networking and mentoring practices, and opportunities for participation in external conferences and events, among others. Annual DE&I Awards celebrate individuals and teams that are making a difference in the work environment and help inspire further actions.  The Company's success also depends on the well-being of employees, including physical, mental and emotional health. DuPont employees have access to online health resources through our global wellness provider to help them improve their overall well-being, including a health assessment, healthy habit building and tracking, videos and content to reduce stress and increase resilience, better sleep habits, nutrition guides, company wellness challenges, and financial wellness education. The Company continues to provide no-cost Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\") services to all employees globally and their immediate household members. All employees also have the support of the Company\u2019s Health Services teams, which provides onsite and intranet-based services to support and monitor the health and welfare of employees. The Company\u2019s larger manufacturing and research sites have onsite clinics where employees can get occupational care, first aid treatment, travel vaccinations and referrals for off-site medical care. The Company continuously strives for zero workplace injuries, occupational illnesses and incidents. The Company\u2019s safety metrics are continually measured against this goal, and DuPont\u2019s Environmental, Health, Safety & Sustainability Committee is charged with driving improvements in the Company's health and safety practices. Health Services also assesses health risks across DuPont to find out which health concerns are most important to the Company's employees, conducts medical surveillance exams based on occupational risks and regulatory compliance priorities flagged by DuPont\u2019s Environmental, Health and Safety team.   14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents As the outcomes of the pandemic eased in many parts of the world in 2022, our colleagues returned to work in accordance with our Global Workplace Principles that guide our approach to flexible working. DuPont continues to embrace workplace flexibility wherever possible, recognizing that different jobs and teams have different requirements.
