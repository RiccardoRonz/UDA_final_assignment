Annuities in each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, comprised less than 1% of premium. The Company does not currently market stand-alone fixed or deferred annuity products.   Pricing \u00a0 Premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality, morbidity, persistency, investment income, expenses, and target profit margins. These assumptions are based on Company experience and projected investment earnings rates. Revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income, and, to a lesser extent, through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products. Profitability is affected by actual experience deviations from the established assumptions and to the extent investment income varies from that required for policy reserves. \u00a0 Collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues, but are added to policyholder account values. Revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs. Profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs. Profits are also earned from investment income in excess of the amounts required for policy reserves.  4   GL 2022 FORM 10-K 4   GL 2022 FORM 10-K 4    GL 2022 FORM 10-K  Table of Contents Table of Contents Underwriting \u00a0 The underwriting standards of Globe Life's insurance subsidiaries are established by management. Each subsidiary uses information obtained from the application, and in some cases, telephone interviews with applicants, inspection reports, pharmacy data, motor vehicle records, responses to both medical and non-medical questions, doctors\u2019 statements and/or medical examinations. This information is used to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application, with a different rating, with a rider, with reduced coverage, or rejected.   Reserves \u00a0 The life insurance policy reserves reflected in Globe Life's consolidated financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These reserves, with future premiums and the associated interest compounded at assumed rates, must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature. Generally, the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on Company experience. Similar reserves are held on most of the health insurance policies written by Globe Life's insurance subsidiaries, since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteed-renewable basis. The assumptions used in the calculation of Globe Life's reserves are reported in Note 1\u2014Significant Accounting Policies. Reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders\u2019 account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments.  Reinsurance  Globe Life has historically participated in very limited third-party reinsurance as a result of the low face amounts of the policies sold by the Company. See Schedule IV and Note 6\u2014Commitments and Contingencies for more information.   Investments \u00a0 The nature, quality, and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws. The investments of Globe Life insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of high-quality, investment-grade securities. Approximately 91% of our invested assets, at fair value, are fixed maturities at December 31, 2022 (see Note 4\u2014Investments and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis).   Competition \u00a0 Globe Life competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service, price, product design, and sales efforts. While there are insurance companies competing with Globe Life, no individual company dominates any of Globe Life's life or health insurance markets. \u00a0 Globe Life's health insurance products compete with, in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and other health care-related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements. \u00a0 The Company effectively competes with other carriers, in part, due to its ability to operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies. This allows Globe Life to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins.   Regulation   Insurance\u2014Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include, among other things, granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, approving certain premium rates, setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, determining the form and content of required financial statements, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. Insurance companies are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies, and records of their business are subject to examination at any time. Under the rules of the  5   GL 2022 FORM 10-K 5   GL 2022 FORM 10-K 5    GL 2022 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Table of Contents National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies.   Risk-Based Capital (RBC)\u2014The NAIC requires that a risk-based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers. The risk-based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula. It is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized. All Globe Life's insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk-based capital formula. See further discussion of RBC in Capital Resources.   Holding Company\u2014States have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system. Globe Life Inc. and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, and New York.  Insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries, and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions.   Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)  Globe Life\u2019s sustainable business practices are a driver of the success and longevity that our Company has experienced since its origin. We plan to advance our sustainable business practices by further developing the Company's ESG strategy and have aligned disclosures with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.   Environmental responsibility and sustainability are key components of our overall corporate responsibility efforts. We strive to reduce our impact on the environment by implementing green building initiatives at our corporate facilities, placing a company-wide emphasis on recycling and reducing waste generally, and focusing on efforts to reduce the use of paper and water. With respect to social matters, our focus continues to be on supporting a culture that is inclusive and attractive for all of our employees and independent sales agents. We are committed to maintaining a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we work. In addition, to enable the Company to appropriately respond to ESG-related challenges and opportunities, the Company has in place an ESG Committee, and the Board and its committees regularly engage with senior management on relevant ESG-related issues.    Human Capital Management  Globe Life's talent base encompasses a broad range of experience that possesses the depth of critical skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish our business purpose and mission, serve our policyholders, and protect our shareholders' interests. Maintaining superior human capital is a key driver to the success and longevity that our Company has experienced since its origins dating back to the early 1900s. As of December\u00a031, 2022, the Company had 3,543 full time, part-time, and temporary employees, a 10% increase over the prior year. The increase in headcount in 2022 was primarily to support the increased growth in recent periods, as well as lower attrition levels than normal. The Company engages over 13,700 independently-contracted insurance agents. Refer to Management's Discussion & Analysis for exclusive agent counts.  People, Culture, and Community  At Globe Life, we are united by our mission to\u2014Make Tomorrow Better1 and this starts with our employees and agents.
