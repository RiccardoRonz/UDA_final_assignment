{"cik": 1373715, "item_1A": "ITEM\u00a01.BUSINESS  ServiceNow was founded on a simple premise: a better technology platform will help work flow better. Our purpose is to make the world work better for everyone. We help global enterprises across industries, universities and governments to digitize their workflows\u2014the individual tasks that need to be executed to get a job done. Our technology platform, which we refer to as the Now Platform, seamlessly connects workflows across siloed organizations and systems in a way that unlocks productivity, improves experiences for both employees and customers and delivers real business outcomes.   We organize our workflow applications along four primary areas: Technology, Customer and Industry, Employee and Creator. Our Technology Workflows give Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d) departments the ability to plan, build, operate and service across the entire technology lifecycle. Our Customer and Industry Workflows help organizations reimagine the customer experience and increase customer loyalty. Our Employee Workflows help customers simplify how their employees get the services they need, creating a familiar, consumer-like way to get work done from wherever an employee may be\u2014at home, in the workplace or in the field. Our Creator Workflows enable our customers to quickly create, test, and deploy their own applications on the Now Platform.  Traditionally, business processes have been automated and embedded across enterprise technology systems from finance, human resources (\u201cHR\u201d), sales, customer support and beyond. Over time, these systems have become disconnected, siloed and complex, as they offer limited flexibility and adaptability and lack the intuition and empowerment that users have come to expect from consumer-grade internet applications and sites. ServiceNow reduces these limitations. We offer the capability to quickly change how work is done to keep pace with a rapidly changing environment. The Now Platform delivers a simple, user-friendly experience, making work easier, faster and more productive.   We believe a better service and end-user experience is the ultimate desired outcome of digital transformation. The Now Platform enables our customers\u2019 digital transformation from non-integrated enterprise technology solutions with manual and disconnected processes and activities, to integrated enterprise technology solutions with automation and connected processes and activities. The transformation to digital operations, enabled by the Now Platform, increases our customers\u2019 resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their employees and consumers.  Our success began with Information Technology Service Management (\u201cITSM\u201d), a category in which ServiceNow remains a market leader. Over time, we expanded beyond our ITSM capabilities to meet the needs of our customers\u2019 expanding digital requirements to modernize technology operations, employee experiences, customer experiences, industry-specific challenges and application development and integration. We are recognized as a leader for multiple products across our Technology, Customer and Industry, Employee and Creator Workflows.  The Now Platform\u2019s task-based orientation allows work to be done with a single, aligned view of every service experience. For example, a new employee uses ServiceNow to complete onboarding tasks with their new employer. The new employee interfaces through an integrated ServiceNow platform that guides the employee through tasks originated from ServiceNow or other systems. Similarly, customer service can be executed in a way that solves problems without creating frustration.  1 1 1 Table of Contents Table of Contents Over the years, we have expanded our customer base, and our customers have expanded their use of the Now Platform. For example, many companies now have multi-year digital transformation plans, many of which involve introducing uses of additional ServiceNow products and services. From a single, out-of-the-box solution, companies recognize the value of using additional products to strengthen the richness and quality of their data running through the Now Platform. As we help organizations realize more value from the Now Platform and better serve their stakeholders, we do so in a manner that also helps organizations accelerate their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) ambitions. To serve the growing focus on ESG, ServiceNow also offers an integrated ESG solution on the Now Platform as part of our Technology Workflows.  ServiceNow strives to help our customers solve their unique challenges, operate on their unique technologies and systems and change at their unique pace. The foundation of our approach to customers and our ambition to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century is grounded in our values. \u2022Wow our customers: Customers are the center of our world. We strive to deliver the best customer experiences and innovations.  \u2022Win as a team: We share the same goals and have clear roles in achieving them. We deliver results as a team and enjoy the journey. \u2022Create belonging: Diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental. Belonging is the breakthrough. We lead with empathy, which means listening and acting to make everyone feel they belong with ServiceNow. \u2022Stay hungry and humble: We do not take success for granted. We are always ready to learn and evolve. We grow together, bringing fresh ideas and new perspectives.  For all these reasons, our customers trust us with their mission critical operations, and we feel immensely proud that \u201cThe World Works with ServiceNow.\u201d  Our Products  ServiceNow\u2019s product portfolio\u2014which spans our Technology, Customer and Industry, Employee and Creator Workflows\u2014is delivered on the Now Platform.

Customer and Industry Workflows  Customer and Industry Workflows help drive customer loyalty with connected digital workflows that deliver modern customer experiences. Customer and Industry Workflows help customers elevate their customer service with enhanced resolution efficiency and improved service quality made possible with workflows, automation and location-based work tasks management. Customer service departments no longer have to rely on agents searching multiple systems to find a single answer to customer issues. Integrating front-end customer service capabilities with operations and field service resources, our Customer and Industry Workflows products help create a seamless customer experience from issue to resolution through connected digital workflows that deliver fast support on a customer\u2019s channel of choice. We enable Customer and Industry Workflows through Customer Service Management, Field Service Management and Industry specific products, among other products.

We offer customer support on a subscription-based model and we offer self-service technical support through our support portal, which provides access to documentation, knowledge base articles, online training, online support forums and online case creation.  Our Technology and Operations  We operate a multi-instance architecture that provides each customer with its own dedicated application logic and database. This architecture is designed to deliver high-availability, scalability, performance, security and ease of upgrading. Our cloud infrastructure primarily consists of industry-standard servers, networks and storage components. We host our full software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) experience on our own private cloud and use public cloud service providers for customers that  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents are primarily in highly regulated markets.   Our data centers operate in paired configurations to enable replication for high-availability and redundancy. We currently operate data centers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, and we continuously evaluate our data center operations and capacity in existing and new geographies.  We offer customers the option to deploy our services on dedicated hardware in our data centers. We also offer customers the option to have their European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) hosted data handled exclusively within the EU. Our architecture gives us the added flexibility to allow customers the option of deploying our services internally or under contract with a third party to host the software in order to support unique regulatory or security requirements. While there are some limitations on agility and flexibility as compared to our cloud offering, a minority of our customers have elected the third-party alternative. The standard and enhanced customer support we provide for self-hosted customers is similar to the support we provide to customers deployed in our managed data centers.  Sales and Marketing \u00a0 We market and sell our products and services to enterprises across industries, including government, financial services, healthcare, telecommunications, manufacturing, IT services, technology, oil and gas, education and consumer products. We sell our product offerings and services through subscription services primarily through our global direct sales organization. We also sell services through managed services providers and resale partners.   Our marketing efforts and lead generation activities consist primarily of customer referrals, digital advertising (including via our website), trade shows, industry events, brand campaigns and press releases. We also host our annual Knowledge user conference, webinars and other user forums, including regional forums, which we call World Forums, where customers and partners both participate in and present on a variety of programs designed to educate them on industry best practices and help accelerate their success.  We continue to expand our sales capabilities in new geographies, including through investments in direct and indirect sales channels, professional services capabilities, customer support resources, post-sales customer support resources, strategic alliances and partnerships, implementation partners and advisory councils. We also plan to increase our investment in our existing locations in order to achieve scale efficiencies in our sales and marketing efforts.  Partner Ecosystem  In addition to our global direct sales organization, we also have a strong and growing ecosystem of partners that helps accelerate our customers\u2019 digital transformation initiatives and deliver customer value at scale. Our partners play a critical role in helping companies digitally transform their business. Our industry and workflow capabilities paired with our partners\u2019 industry and functional domain experience help customers of all sizes. Together with our partners, we offer industry and domain-focused solutions at scale and are accelerating digital transformation as we help companies drive new approaches in engaging their end users and employees.  Customers \u00a0 We primarily sell our services to large enterprise customers, and we host and support large, enterprise-wide deployments for our customers. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 7,700 enterprise customers. Our customers operate in a wide variety of industries, including government, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, IT services, technology, oil and gas, telecommunications, education and consumer products. The portion of our revenues generated by sales to government customers has also increased over time. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Doing business with the public sector and heavily-regulated organizations subjects us to risks related to the government procurement process, regulations, and contracting requirements\u201d for additional information about our sales to government customers.  Research and Development \u00a0 Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and validation of our solutions. We focus on innovating and developing new services and core technologies and further enhancing the functionality, reliability and performance of our existing solutions. Using emerging technologies, we can anticipate customer demands and then bring new services and new versions of existing services to market quickly in order to remain competitive in the marketplace. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and development to broaden our  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents platform capabilities, strengthen our existing applications, expand the number of applications on our platform, enhance our user experience and develop additional mobile, automation and machine intelligence technologies.    Acquisitions and Investments  In addition to our own research and development investments, we have made strategic acquisitions and investments and will continue to assess opportunities to complement our technology and skill sets and expand our product reach. Our focus is on building out our platform and products through both organic investments to support customer needs and acquisitions of talent and enhanced capabilities. For example, our acquisitions and larger strategic investments in 2022 focused on bringing observability and log management, additional AI capabilities, real-time process execution capabilities, process mining and skills mapping intelligence to the Now Platform and across our suite of products.  Competition \u00a0 As customers accelerate their digital transformation plans and digital operation initiatives, they demand less complexity and lower total cost solutions for the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their IT environments. The Now Platform is designed to meet customers\u2019 demands and offers solutions that are complementary to the offerings of many enterprise software vendors. We work directly with product and service offerings from a broad range of companies, including some of the largest in the world, and continuously increase our strategic alliances with many of these companies as we expand our integrations for customers. As we grow and the space where we operate develops and matures, we increasingly find ourselves in competition with solutions and alternative approaches to solving customer needs, including:  \u2022Enterprise application software vendors. We designed the Now Platform to quickly integrate with, and complement the performance of well-established, enterprise application software vendors, such as Oracle, SAP, Salesforce and Workday. Customers may choose to work directly with their application software vendors to improve integrations and create connected workflows.  \u2022New technologies and entrants. Markets are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry. New technologies and competitors are entering the markets to solve similar problems in different ways, intensifying competition. Customers may choose alternative technologies to improve integrations and create connected workflows. New entrants may choose to offer software tailored to specific services, as opposed to competing across all Now Platform capabilities.   \u2022In-house solutions. Customers may choose to work with their internal IT departments or other personnel to build custom workflow solutions and integrations.  \u2022Cloud-based vendors. As businesses increasingly utilize public cloud and SaaS-based offerings, they are adopting a hybrid (on-premises and off-premises) approach for their existing and new compute workloads. As a result, our services will need to increasingly compete for customers\u2019 hybrid IT workloads with off-premises public cloud and SaaS-based offerings.   Intellectual Property \u00a0 We rely upon a combination of U.S. and international copyright, trade secret, patent and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality and license agreements, to establish, protect and grow our intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) rights. In addition, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, partners, vendors, consultants and other third parties and control access to our IP and other proprietary information. We also purchase or license IP and technology that we incorporate into our products or services.  We continue to grow our global patent portfolio and IP rights that relate to our platform, applications, services, research and development and other activities. Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and IP. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 2,000 U.S. and foreign patents, including patents acquired from third parties, and over 700 pending patent applications. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or other IP right or group of related patents or IP rights. We file patent applications to protect our IP and have and may continue to acquire additional patents, patent portfolios or patent applications. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Lawsuits against us by third parties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results\u201d for additional information.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Environmental, Social and Governance  Our ESG strategy is driven by our purpose to \u201cmake the world work better for everyone.\u201d Our global impact programs focus on areas where we can make our business, our communities and the world more equitable and sustainable. The challenges we and our stakeholders have been facing in the last few years, such as the pandemic, racial injustice and climate change, have emphasized the unique role we can have as a company in helping our customers manage their ESG priorities. Initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint of our operations not only serve the purpose of sustaining our planet, but also make us more attractive to our customers who are looking to reduce their own carbon footprint and that of their supply chains. Initiatives to improve our diversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) serve to build a more inclusive workforce. They also help us to attract and retain the diverse talent that allows us to innovate more quickly and create products that \u201cwow our customers.\u201d Initiatives to strengthen the governance of our business\u2014leading with ethics and focusing on security and data privacy\u2014 improve the oversight of our business and also help us to earn trust with our customers that makes them comfortable managing more of their core business operations with our products. In this way, our ESG strategy is embedded in our business priorities, culture and values.   Our board of directors and management team oversee our ESG strategy. Specifically, our Nominating and Governance Committee oversees our ESG activities, programs, risks and public disclosures; our Audit Committee oversees our processes, procedures and validation surrounding our ESG disclosures; and our Compensation Committee oversees our human capital management. Our enterprise-wide ESG Steering Committee, under the leadership of our CFO, helps guide our ESG strategy, goals, progress and key initiatives. Our additional management steering committees and councils help address specific priorities such as risk management, compliance and data governance. Activities and progress against our ESG priorities are regularly reviewed by the board of directors.  We began issuing our annual Global Impact Report in 2021 to provide insights into the ESG areas where we are focusing our efforts. For the environment, we are sustaining our planet by supporting the transition to a net-zero world for our customers and our own operations. For governance, we are acting with integrity by building trust through ethical, transparent and secure business practices. For social, we are creating work opportunities that are equitable, accessible and rewarding for all people. Additional information about our social initiatives is discussed below in \u201c\u2014Human Capital Management.\u201d In April 2022, we announced an expansion of our carbon neutrality commitment to provide our customers with a carbon neutral cloud. In early 2022, we signed on our first customers for our new ESG Management solution and we were once again listed as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for North America.  Human Capital Management  Our People Strategy  Our People Strategy is pivotal to our goal of becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Our People Strategy is designed to help us execute against our business strategy, while living our best lives, doing our best work and fulfilling our purpose together. We aim to attract, recruit, develop and retain the best, most diverse talent, celebrating the diversity and differences that drive our innovation and creativity. We are committed to a respectful, rewarding and inclusive work environment that enables our people to grow themselves, grow their teams and grow the business with the mission to make the world work better for everyone. Our People Strategy is based on two foundational principles and three key pillars.  Foundational principles  \u2022We must always honor ServiceNow\u2019s authentic culture and purpose as we continue to grow.  \u2022We must ensure that our People Strategy is informed by data and insights as we strive to scale efficiently and make informed and unbiased decisions.   Key focus areas  \u2022Scale and Innovation: Build a talent system that helps us attract, grow and retain the people who will drive our business forward.   \u2022Inclusive Employee Experience: Power our company with a more diverse workforce, equitable processes that drive positive outcomes and inclusive employee experience.  \u2022Growth and Development: Invest in new learning and development paths and resources for our people to grow themselves and their teams.   9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our Culture  ServiceNow\u2019s culture is grounded in our values, first discussed above. We live our culture by regularly listening to our people and gathering feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. We listen through our Employee Voice Surveys (\u201cEVS\u201d), which measure and analyze employee engagement, including on such topics as inclusion and belonging, learning and development, recognition, pay, and wellbeing. EVS insights are used to action plan at all levels of the organization and inform the assessment of our human capital management approach and its alignment with our purpose and business strategy.   We also listen by gaining insights across the employee lifecycle through onboarding, exit, and other check-in surveys. Among other things, our listening in 2022 gave us invaluable insights into employees\u2019 desire for more career development and enablement tools and resources, which also led to the development and refinement of our performance management tools available on the Now Platform.   As a result of our culture, we earned several external recognitions in 2022 that speak to our strong culture, including from the Fortune World\u2019s Most Admired Companies, the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For and the Glassdoor Best Places to Work.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion   \u201cCreating Belonging\u201d is one of our four company values. We expect each of our people to live our values both inside and outside of the work environment. We have several initiatives focused on recruiting, learning and development, and culture to weave DEI throughout our talent processes to drive sustainable progress as we strive to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture. In 2022, following the appointment of our Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer, we formalized our global DEI strategic framework with a focus on inclusion in and through our business. The framework has three pillars:  \u2022Enable and empower our people: Drive a relentless commitment to employee belonging and success by enhancing equitable processes, policies and practices across the moments that matter for our employees. \u2022Hire with intent: Recruit high performing and diverse talent across all levels by designing a unique and exemplary hiring process that is global and collaborative. \u2022Amplify DEI impact: Build on the global ESG/DEI movement with human ingenuity and technology by advancing DEI with like-minded customers, suppliers and community partners.  Within ServiceNow, we support multiple Belonging Groups for women, racial and ethnic minorities, military veterans, people with disabilities, people of different faiths and people who identify as LGBTQI+. These groups are intended to give employees a safe space and help support our culture and community-building efforts across ServiceNow. We also publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics in the various reports we issue that include information on gender, race, and ethnic minority representation in our U.S. employee population. In addition, we launched an internal \u201cDiversity Advisory Council\u201d tasked with identifying and addressing DEI opportunity areas within ServiceNow. These efforts are enhanced through a new inclusive leadership development course required for all people managers.  We also create belonging in our communities. Our NextGen Professional Program (\u201cNextGen\u201d) supports our digital readiness focus area. We recently launched RiseUp, a global program designed to skill one million people on the ServiceNow Platform by 2024. It aspires to fuel a new economy of in-demand, job-ready talent with an emphasis on faster, more equitable career paths in the high-growth ServiceNow ecosystem. While the program is currently focused on placing talent within ServiceNow customers and partners, RiseUp also is expected to create a pipeline of new, diverse talent for ServiceNow in the near future. The program invests in digital skills training for marginalized and underserved communities. In addition, we are helping break down systemic barriers by offering digital experiences for students in Hispanic Serving Institutions, Puerto Rican Universities and Historically Black Colleges and Universities to provide development opportunities, such as launching a \u201cwomen code to win\u201d contest at those institutions.  Total Rewards  Our total rewards philosophy has at its core the goal of attracting, rewarding, and retaining top talent to help us execute our strategy and mission. We believe in competitive pay practices and a pay-for-performance culture. In addition to base salary, all our employees are eligible to participate in our annual cash bonus plan or in our sales commission plan. In order to attract and retain the best talent, we have a broad-based discretionary equity program and an employee stock purchase plan, which enable employees to participate in our success. Our employees enjoy expansive and diverse benefit offerings that focus on physical, mental and financial wellbeing.  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Pay Equity  Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and respectfully. We believe there should be equity across the entire talent ecosystem \u2013 from hiring through career advancement. To achieve that, we continue to build and scale equitable people practices that foster inclusive and fair outcomes for all employees. This includes pay equity. Because pay equity is so dynamic at a high-growth company like ours, we manage it on an ongoing basis and do regular analyses and adjustments, as warranted. We are proud that our process led us to achieve systematic pay equity as of September 1, 2022, our latest company-wide analysis, and helps ensure that we maintain pay equity on an ongoing basis.  Learning and Development  Our people have a deep desire to learn and grow. Our learning and development programs are designed to \u201cgrow self, grow team, grow business.\u201d In addition to the extensive functional learning program run by individual business units that focus on technical skills and capabilities, our global Learning and Development program is focused on enabling all our people \u2013 from our early-in-career talent who have access to programs that help them plan for professional growth and financial success to our more tenured leaders who have access to programs focusing on the importance of inclusive leadership, strategy and trust in the new world of work.  New Ways of Working and Wellbeing  Our Future of Work policy supports our people as they adapt to new ways of working that shift paradigms, embrace flexibility, promote inclusion and drive innovation. Beginning in 2022, the majority of our employees are expected in a workplace three days or fewer a week, which provides them flexibility to organize their schedules. Our flexible working environment enables us to attract, recruit and retain the best talent and we believe such an environment will only serve to strengthen our company. Our growing fully-remote workforce allows us to continue sourcing different, more diverse talent who are not geographically close to a ServiceNow office location.  ServiceNow is committed to supporting wellbeing for employees at work and in their personal lives. Our standard, comprehensive benefits package covers many physical, emotional and financial wellness programs. We also offer our employees additional time-off with \u201cWellbeing Days\u201d to further support their health and wellness.  Workforce Metrics  As of December 31, 2022, we employed 20,433 people on a full-time basis, 10,960 in the United States and 9,473 internationally. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. Employees in certain European countries are represented by workers\u2019 councils and have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national and/or sector level. We have not experienced interruptions of operations or work stoppages due to labor disagreements.
