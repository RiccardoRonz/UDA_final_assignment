The Company believes it has an adequate supply of raw materials necessary to meet demand and continues to actively manage supply chain constraints. In addition, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity pricing and inflation and attempts to control these impacts through increased prices to customers and various other programs with its suppliers.   Suppliers  The Company manufactures many of the parts and components used in its products. Substantially all materials, parts and components purchased by the Company are available from a large number of independent sources around the world. The Company believes it has a sufficient number of suppliers necessary to meet demand but continues to actively evaluate its current suppliers and identify alternative sources to manage supply chain constraints, as needed.   Inventory and Backlog  The Company regularly and systematically adjusts production schedules and quantities based on the flow of incoming orders. During 2022, backlog was elevated as compared to pre-pandemic levels due to supply chain constraints, which both extended lead times and shifted customer order patterns as well as increased inventory to support production. However, the Company remains a short cycle business and backlog is not considered a significant factor in the Company\u2019s business as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of the Company\u2019s products. The Company remains focused on delivering products and services to customers against an elevated backlog and continues to actively manage inventory levels. Further, with respect to order cancellations, the Company has not historically experienced significant order cancellations and does not expect significant order cancellations in the future.  Shared Services  The Company has production facilities in Suzhou, China and Vadodara, India that support multiple business units.

Approximately 4% of its employees are covered by various collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. which will expire at various times between now and October 2026. Of those, approximately 1% of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. which will expire within one year. Management believes that the Company has a positive relationship with its employees. The Company historically has been able to renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements satisfactorily, with its last work stoppage occurring in March 1993.   Human Capital Management  The Company recognizes that its success would not be possible without the valuable contributions of its workforce. Investment in people enables the Company to accomplish its goals and deliver innovative customer solutions. The Company\u2019s corporate Human Capital strategy is overseen by its Chief Human Resource Officer (\u201cCHRO\u201d).

The Company\u2019s workforce advancement strategy is focused through investment in three pillars: skill-building for the entire workforce, leadership development aligned with the Company\u2019s methodology and fostering a great culture. The Company\u2019s approach to performance management, talent development management and employee engagement helps drive long-term value by providing employees with opportunities to do and be their best both individually and as teams:  \u2022As part of our Organizational Talent Cycle process, we conduct regular in-depth talent reviews of our workforce teams and culture with business leaders, identify \u201cstretch\u201d opportunities to grow team members, and connect our decentralized businesses by moving skilled employees from one business unit to another as opportunities and interest arise. Employees and leaders have performance and development conversations throughout the year, talking about business and development goals, reviewing progress, recognizing accomplishments, giving balanced feedback, and identifying opportunities for improvement. Open, honest dialog about performance, development and career growth supports our values of trust, team and excellence and The IDEX Difference, building trust and helping us fulfill our purpose. \u2022Employees have access to resources that enhance and build capabilities, including specific individual development plans and local training and development programs. In support of our growth strategy and culture, the Company also sponsors global leadership programs through the IDEX Academy which provides accelerated development for key leaders to deepen our pipeline across multiple levels of leadership. Our learning curriculum includes instructor-led, self-paced and blended solutions that have been created internally or sourced from external partners. These offerings also help to develop future and potential leaders in the IDEX leadership methodology.  \u2022The Company also enables employee development and growth by offering eligible U.S. employees the opportunity to participate in the Tuition Reimbursement program. Through the program, employees can have certain expenses from secondary educational institutions reimbursed up to $5,250 per year.  \u2022The Company prioritizes hiring team members who will embrace the team-driven culture and also places considerable emphasis on leveraging the talented employees within the Company\u2019s internal pipeline, filling many leadership positions with Company employees.  \u2022Across the enterprise, the Company\u2019s goal is to achieve manufacturing company top quartile employee engagement as measured by its engagement survey. We believe our employees have a high level of engagement as the Company\u2019s employee engagement index remains above the average for manufacturing companies at 76 percent.      11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Employee Pay and Benefits  Attracting and retaining top talent is critical to the success of the Company\u2019s business. The Company offers a highly competitive pay and benefits package for employees in all the markets where it operates. The performance-based pay packages provide many employees with short-term performance incentives. The Company also provides equity-based, long-term incentives to its senior leaders. In 2022, a number of the Company\u2019s business units took proactive action with off-cycle pay rate increases for hourly employees with the onset of higher cost of living expenses associated with rising inflation. The Company regularly reviews its compensation structure and intends to adjust pay as necessary to retain key talent.  The Company\u2019s U.S. employees can participate in a 401(k) retirement plan and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows an employee to purchase IDEX stock through payroll deductions.   Diversity, Equity & Inclusion   The Company has always recognized diversity as foundational to creativity and resilience; the three pillars of Innovation, Diversity and Excellence form the acronym that is the Company\u2019s name, IDEX. Gender, ethnic, cultural and other human diversity is critical to the Company\u2019s success.   In 2022, the Company launched its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) strategic roadmap.  To prepare leadership for the launch, executives participated in a day-long strategy and development session which included a cultural competence assessment and personal feedback for all senior leaders.
