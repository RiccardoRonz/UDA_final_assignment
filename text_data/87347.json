In 2021, SLB became the first company in the energy services industry to commit to a 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions target including all three emission scopes. By setting targets based on SLB\u2019s total 2019 baseline GHG footprint\u2014inclusive of Scope 3 emissions (which accounted for approximately 95% of SLB\u2019s baseline)\u2014and not just its Scope 1 and 2 footprint, SLB\u2019s comprehensive emissions reduction roadmap addressees the entire oil and gas value chain. \u00a0 SLB\u2019s 2050 net zero target is supported by the following interim milestones, using 2019 as the baseline year: \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n-\n\nby 2025, a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions; \u00a0 - by 2025, a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions; \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n-\n\nby 2030, a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions; and \u00a0 - by 2030, a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions; and \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n-\n\nby 2030, a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions. \u00a0 - by 2030, a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions. \u00a0 There are three key components to SLB achieving the 2050 net-zero target: reducing operational emissions, reducing customer emissions that occur while using SLB technology, and taking carbon-negative actions of sufficient scale to offset any residual operating and technology emissions that the Company may have in 2050. SLB\u2019s Scope 1 and 2 emissions primarily come from fuel use and  6 \u00a0 electricity consumption: Scope 3 emissions are indirect, such as emissions from customers\u2019 use of SLB technology and emissions from our use of third-party goods and services. \u00a0 In tandem with our 2050 net-zero commitment, SLB introduced a portfolio of Transition Technologies in 2021. This portfolio includes a select group of products and services that quantifiably reduce our customers\u2019 GHG emissions footprint, while continuing to drive high performance, reliability and efficiency. This portfolio will be supported by an industry-leading impact quantification framework and is set to grow as sustainability is further embedded in the Company\u2019s research and development process. \u00a0 While there is an ambitious path ahead, we are cementing our position as a sustainability leader today. SLB continues to be one of the highest-ranked companies in the energy industry across key environmental, social, and governance ratings agencies as of December 31, 2022. This recognition confirms the strategy we have in place and our commitment to leading change in the industry. Human Capital As a leading global technology company, with a workforce consisting of approximately 99,000 people in more than 100 countries, one of SLB\u2019s greatest strengths is the diversity of our people. We believe that our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain a highly competent and diverse workforce has been paramount to our success for many decades. We recognize that cultivating diversity and promoting inclusion are essential to attracting the best talent from around the world and enabling creativity and innovation to drive business success. \u00a0 Energy transition and changing geopolitics are increasingly impacting our people and customers. SLB is competitively well-positioned from both a people and technology perspective to manage these factors and capture the opportunity that it represents for SLB and the countries where we work. \u00a0 Our national and cultural diversity is based in our philosophy to recruit and develop people from the communities where we work. As a result, we maintain a workforce nationality mix aligned to the revenue derived from the countries in which we work, as reflected in the charts below. Our long-standing commitment to national and cultural diversity, which is seen throughout every layer of SLB, fosters a culture that is global in outlook, yet local in practice. \u00a0    \u00a0 7 \u00a0 \u00a0 In addition to national and cultural diversity, gender balance is an important part of our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy. We are committed to leading our industry in gender diversity, and we are on track to reach our interim milestone of having women represent 25% of our salaried employees by 2025. Our next milestone is for women to comprise 30% of our salaried employees by 2030. \u00a0 SLB is proud to provide a career platform that enables a culture of lifelong learning for all employees and is committed to offering borderless careers and making career decisions based on merit. SLB\u2019s borderless career philosophy is powered by its talent and mobility practices, which offer employees multiple, flexible career paths to help them acquire the required skills to reach their potential. We provide continuous growth opportunities through a combination of learning and experience. SLB strives to identify talent early and to provide opportunities for those employees who demonstrate exceptional performance and the ability to progress to higher levels within the organization. These opportunities accelerate career development while fostering an agile workforce and the next generation of business leaders. Competition The principal methods of competition within the energy services industry are technological innovation, quality of service, and price differentiation. These factors vary geographically and are dependent upon the different services and products that SLB offers. SLB has numerous competitors, both large and small.  Intellectual Property SLB owns or controls the industry\u2019s leading portfolio of intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information, trade secrets, and software tools and applications that, in the aggregate, are material to SLB\u2019s business. While SLB seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is material to SLB\u2019s business.  Seasonality  Seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of SLB\u2019s products and services. For example, the spring thaw in Canada and other Northern climates and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels, while the winter months in the North Sea, Russia, and China can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity. In addition, hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations. Furthermore, customer spending patterns for exploration data, software, and other products may result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of the year as clients seek to fully utilize their annual budgets. Conversely, customer budget constraints in North America may lead to lower demand for our services and products in the fourth quarter of the year.  Customers SLB\u2019s primary customers are national oil companies, large integrated oil companies and independent operators. No single customer exceeded 10% of SLB\u2019s consolidated revenue during each of 2022, 2021 and 2020. Governmental Regulations  SLB is subject to numerous environmental and other governmental and regulatory requirements related to its operations worldwide. For additional details, see \u201cItem 1(a).
