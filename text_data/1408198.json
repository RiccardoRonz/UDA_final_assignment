Industry Trends and Competitive Advantages We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from emerging trends and to help our clients adapt to a large and rapidly expanding and evolving investment industry. Investing has grown in complexity, with more choices across asset classes, security types and geographies, and more consideration of a wider array of risks and opportunities, including those related to ESG and climate. In addition, the construction and management of investment portfolios are becoming increasingly outcome-oriented, rules-based and technology-driven. As a result, the investment process is transforming, which is reflected in several trends we have observed, including: \u2022Changing client operating models and business strategies, driven in part by fee compression, changing demographics, the regulatory environment and shifting economic outlooks;  1 For this purpose, affiliated companies under a common parent entity are aggregated and counted as a single client.  2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Increasing use of global, multi-asset-class and other complex investment strategies, including strategies incorporating private asset investments and factor objectives, as investors seek specific and unique outcomes; \u2022The need for high-quality data, insightful models and timely research during times of extreme volatility and high uncertainty; \u2022Accelerating integration of ESG and climate considerations into investment processes, reporting and products, as sustainable investing becomes more prominent and investors increasingly focus on companies with strong sustainability practices as an indicator of long-term resilience;  \u2022Continuing growth of indexed investing through indexed investment products such as ETFs, mutual/UCITS funds and annuities, as well as indexed derivatives such as futures, options, structured products and over-the-counter swaps, and other vehicles that seek to track an index, as investors increasingly seek lower-cost investment strategies or seek to incorporate increasingly complex investment strategies across geographies, sectors, factors, trends and other considerations;  \u2022Increasing allocation of capital to real estate and other private assets and desire for greater transparency into the performance of private assets, with an increased focus on climate and income risk; \u2022Increasing demand for data and tools that clients can integrate to support customized portfolio construction and highly specialized preferences and objectives; and  \u2022Growing use of advanced technologies to enhance investment analytics, evaluate data, streamline operations, create efficiencies and gain competitive advantages. We believe the following competitive advantages position us well to meet client demands in light of these trends: \u2022Differentiated research-enhanced content provides our clients with insights to better understand and adapt to a complex and fast-changing marketplace. We are continually developing a wide range of differentiated content and have amassed an extensive database of historical global market data, proprietary equity index data, ESG and climate data, factor models, private asset benchmark data and risk algorithms, all of which can be critical components of our clients\u2019 investment processes. This content is grounded in our deep knowledge of the global investment process and fueled by experienced research and product development and data management teams.  \u2022Client-centricity allows us to build strong client relationships globally and better understand and service our clients\u2019 needs in the markets in which they operate. Our client coverage team develops and maintains strong and trusted relationships with senior executives and investment professionals, and we regularly consult with clients and other market participants to discuss their needs, investment trends and implications for our research, product development and client servicing goals. \u2022Strong product innovation, supported by flexible, scalable, cutting-edge technology developed by our global team of sophisticated technology and data professionals, enables clients to use MSCI, third-party and their own content efficiently and cost-effectively.

Strategy We provide critical tools and solutions that enable investors to manage the transformations taking place in the investment industry, better understand performance and risk, and build portfolios more effectively and efficiently to achieve their investment objectives. We are focused on the following key initiatives to deliver actionable and integrated client solutions: \u2022Extend leadership in research-enhanced content across asset classes. We continue to develop and deliver innovative solutions that incorporate proprietary and highly differentiated content based on rich insights from our research and product development teams. In addition to enhancing our position as a leading provider of tools and solutions for equity investors globally, our strategic priorities also include enhancing our content relating to other asset classes and strategies, including ESG and climate, thematics, factors, fixed income, liquidity and private assets, all of which we believe represent significant growth opportunities. \u2022Lead the enablement of ESG and climate investment integration by delivering the data, information and applications necessary to identify, assess and incorporate material ESG and climate risks and opportunities. The global adoption of ESG and climate-focused investment considerations and the establishment of ESG and climate reporting frameworks are both rapidly accelerating. As demand from our clients for ESG and climate solutions increases,  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents MSCI\u2019s research, tools and solutions will aim to provide the transparency our clients need to better integrate ESG and climate risks and opportunities into their investment processes. Our ESG ratings and climate data and research are also utilized in our index, analytics and private asset tools and solutions \u2013 from ESG and climate indexes to incorporation of ESG and climate data in risk analysis to climate and emissions assessments specific to real estate assets and private equity portfolios. We are focused on being an influential thought leader on these climate-related considerations for the investment industry. \u2022Enhance distribution and content-enabling technology. We are deploying and developing advanced technology to drive integration and efficiencies, accelerate the pace of innovation and enhance distribution and the client experience. We increasingly utilize proprietary and third-party technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing tools, to enhance our ability to gather and analyze data, create content and automate and enhance the efficiency of many of our data processes. Our open-architecture, web-based Investment Solutions as a Service (\u201cISaaS\u201d) offerings now include MSCI ONE, an integrated platform that provides access to investment content across a number of our products and solutions. These offerings help us deliver MSCI content and solutions to our clients at scale. \u2022Expand solutions that empower client customization. We aim to further enhance how we support our clients\u2019 investment objectives by embedding our highly differentiated research, data and methodologies into solutions that allow clients to incorporate their custom preferences. For example, we will leverage existing capabilities and applications to deliver solutions that will allow clients to reflect their unique risk and return, ESG and climate and thematic preferences, as well as tax optimization strategies in a scalable way. In addition, we aim to meet client demand for flexible tools and data needed to construct and manage portfolios.  \u2022Strengthen client relationships and grow into strategic partnerships with clients. We aim to be a strategic partner to members of the investment community by anticipating their needs, promoting the full breadth of our tools, data and solutions, and building a seamless experience across our offerings. The depth of knowledge of our client coverage teams, including dedicated account managers, ensures that we are engaging with our clients in a holistic and integrated manner. In particular, we are leveraging our existing offerings to serve new and developing client use cases. Through innovation, we aim to enhance the effectiveness and ease of use of our products as we further demonstrate the value of our content, applications and services. \u2022Execute strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies. We regularly evaluate and selectively pursue strategic relationships with, and acquisitions of, providers of unique and differentiated content, products and technologies that we believe have the potential to complement, enhance or expand our offerings and client base. In order to drive value, we target acquisitions and strategic relationships that can be efficiently integrated into our existing operational structure and global sales network. For example, through our 2021 acquisition of Real Capital Analytics, Inc. (\u201cRCA\u201d), we expanded MSCI\u2019s robust suite of real asset solutions, by allowing us to provide real estate industry professionals with more data, analytics and support tools to manage investments and understand performance and risk, including climate risks, within their portfolios. Financial Model We have an attractive financial model due to our recurring revenue and strong cash generation. Clients purchase our products and services primarily through recurring fixed and variable fee arrangements, a business model which has historically delivered stable revenue and predictable cash flows. Finally, our disciplined capital-allocation policy provides us with flexibility to balance internal resources and investment needs, acquisitions and shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.

ESG and Climate Indexes are constructed from an underlying index by applying data from our ESG and Climate segment to additional screening or other criteria. \u2022Factor Indexes.

Custom Indexes are calculated by applying additional criteria supplied by a client \u2013 such as stock exclusion lists, currency hedging rules, tax rates or special weighting \u2013 to an MSCI index. Investors with unique index requirements can build an index to meet their specific needs and better update index design over time to support their evolving investment strategies. \u2022Fixed Income Indexes. Fixed Income Indexes include both investment grade and high-yield securities across a number of currencies that reflect the performance of credit markets generally, or specific investment strategies, including climate-focused or factor strategies. \u2022Real Estate Indexes.

This classification system was developed in response to investors\u2019 need for a comprehensive and consistent framework for classifying companies into industries.   2 The number of indexes includes different return versions (e.g., price, net and gross returns) but does not include different currency versions. 5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents GICS is widely accepted as an industry analysis framework for investment research, portfolio management and asset allocation.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, 58.0% of our revenues were attributable to our Index segment. A majority of those revenues were attributable to annual, recurring subscriptions. A portion of our revenues comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexed investment products. Such fees are primarily based on a client\u2019s assets under management (\u201cAUM\u201d) or trading volumes and are referred to herein as asset-based fees. Since market movement and investment trends impact our asset-based fees, our revenues from asset-based fees are subject to volatility.
