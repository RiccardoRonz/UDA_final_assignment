{"cik": 1140859, "item_1A": "ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS On August 30, 2023, AmerisourceBergen Corporation changed its corporate name to Cencora, Inc. As used herein, the terms \"Company,\" \"Cencora,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\" refer to Cencora, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Cencora is one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. We deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health. More specifically, we distribute a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name, and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers located in the United States and select global markets, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, physician practices, medical and dialysis clinics, veterinarians, and other customers. Additionally, we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services, including data analytics, outcomes research, reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services (including regulatory affairs, development consulting and scientific affairs, pharmacovigilance, and quality management and compliance) niche premium logistics services, inventory management, pharmacy automation, pharmacy management, and packaging solutions.  Industry Overview Pharmaceutical sales in the United States, as recently estimated by IQVIA, an independent third-party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 7.9% from 2022 through 2027, and the growth rate is dependent, in part, on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases. In addition to general economic conditions, factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the United States and other industry trends include: Aging Population. The number of individuals aged 65 and over in the United States is expected to exceed 68 million by 2027 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population. This age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the United States. Introduction of New Pharmaceuticals. Traditional research and development, as well as the advent of new research, production, and delivery methods, such as biotechnology and gene therapy, continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases. We believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry. In particular, we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business. Increased Use of Generic and Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals. A number of patents for widely used brand-name pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years. In addition, increased emphasis by managed care and other third-party payors on utilization of generics and biosimilars has accelerated their growth. We consider the increase in generic and biosimilar usage a favorable trend because generic and biosimilar pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brand-name products, although their lower prices reduce revenue growth. Generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 90% of the prescription volume in the United States. Increased Use of Drug Therapies. In response to rising healthcare costs, governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases. While national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs, we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays. Pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 15% of overall healthcare costs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers' continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of cost-effective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies. Other economic conditions and certain risk factors could adversely affect our business and prospects (see Item 1A. Risk Factors). 1 1 1 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  The Company We serve our customers (healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers) through a geographically diverse network of distribution service centers and other operations in the United States and select global markets. In our pharmaceutical distribution businesses, we are typically the primary supplier of pharmaceutical and related products to our healthcare provider customers.

The Canada business drives innovative partnerships with manufacturers, providers, and pharmacies to improve product access and efficiency throughout the healthcare supply chain. \u2022Acquisitions and Investments. In order to grow our core strategic offerings and to enter related markets, we have acquired and invested in businesses and will continue to consider additional acquisitions and investments. We acquired and assumed control of PharmaLex Holding GmbH (\"PharmaLex\") effective January 1, 2023 for $1.473 billion. PharmaLex is a leading provider of specialized services for the life sciences industry. PharmaLex's services include regulatory affairs, development consulting and scientific affairs, pharmacovigilance, and quality management and compliance.

In June 2023, we and TPG, a global alternative asset management firm, acquired OneOncology, LLC (\"OneOncology\"), a network of leading oncology practices. Including all direct transaction costs, we invested $718.4 million (representing 34.9%) in a joint venture formed to acquire OneOncology for approximately $2.1 billion, and TPG acquired the majority interest in the joint venture. We account for our interest in the joint venture as an equity method investment. \u2022Divestitures.\u00a0In order to allow us to concentrate on our strategic focus areas, we have divested certain non-core businesses and may, from time to time, consider additional divestitures. We divested certain non-core subsidiaries in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Operations Operating Structure  We are organized geographically based upon the products and services we provide to our customers. Our operations are comprised of two reportable segments: U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions.  U.S. Healthcare Solutions Segment The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectable pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. Additionally, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. It also provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that ranges from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. Additionally, it delivers  3 3 3 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. Through its animal health business, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. It also offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers.  International Healthcare Solutions Segment The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment consists of businesses that focus on international pharmaceutical wholesale and related service operations and global commercialization services. The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes pharmaceuticals, other healthcare products, and related services to healthcare providers, including pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals primarily in Europe. It is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. It also is a leading provider of specialized services, including regulatory affairs, development consulting and scientific affairs, pharmacovigilance, and quality management and compliance, for the life sciences industry. In Canada, the business drives innovative partnerships with manufacturers, providers, and pharmacies to improve product access and efficiency throughout the healthcare supply chain. Sales and Marketing  The majority of U.S. Healthcare Solutions' sales force is led nationally, with geographic focus and specialized by either healthcare provider type or size. Customer service representatives are centralized to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner. U.S. Healthcare Solutions also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings. U.S. Healthcare Solutions' sales teams also serve national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensure that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs. Our International Healthcare Solutions' businesses each have independent sales forces that specialize in their respective product and service offerings. In addition, we have an enterprise-wide marketing team that coordinates branding and all other marketing activities across the Company. Customers We have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers. Institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals, health systems, mail order pharmacies, long-term care and other alternate care pharmacies, and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities, physicians, and physician group practices. Retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains, independent community pharmacies, pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers, and veterinarians. We are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers. Our manufacturer customers include branded, generic, and biotechnology manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals, as well as over-the-counter product and health and beauty aid manufacturers. In addition, we offer a broad range of value-added solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers, thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers. Our two largest customers, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (\"WBA\") and Express Scripts,\u00a0Inc. (\"Express Scripts\"), accounted for approximately 26% and approximately 14%, respectively, of revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Our top 10 customers, including governmental agencies and group purchasing organizations (\"GPO\"), represented approximately 66% of revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The loss of any major customer or\u00a0GPO relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations. Additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended, renewed, or replaced prior to their expiration dates. If those contracts are not renewed, or are extended, renewed, or replaced at less favorable terms, they may negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. Suppliers We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which accounted for 10% or more of our purchases in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally good. The 10 largest suppliers in fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 accounted for approximately 48% of our purchases. Information Systems The U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating segment\u2019s distribution facilities in the United States primarily operate under a single enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system. U.S. Healthcare Solutions\u2019 ERP system provides for, among other things, electronic order entry by customers, invoice preparation and purchasing, and inventory tracking. Our International Healthcare Solutions operating segment operates under various operating systems. We continue to make investments to enhance and  4 4 4 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  upgrade the operating systems utilized by our International Healthcare Solutions operating segments, including, but not limited to, Alliance Healthcare. We also continue to invest in cybersecurity capabilities as a key priority to improve and enhance our cyber resiliency.  Additionally, we continue to improve our entity-wide infrastructure environment to drive efficiency, capabilities, and speed to market. To comply with pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements, we have made significant investments in our secure supply chain information systems (see Risk Factor\u00a0- Increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply chain may increase our costs and reduce our profitability). We will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology.  U.S. Healthcare Solutions has made significant investments in its electronic ordering systems. U.S. Healthcare Solutions\u2019 systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by helping customers to reduce operating costs, and by providing them a platform for various basic and value-added services, including product demand data, inventory replenishment, single-source billing, third-party claims processing, real-time price and incentive updates, and price labels. U.S. Healthcare Solutions processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders, invoices, and payments electronically, and it continues to make substantial investments to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers. U.S. Healthcare Solutions has warehouse operating systems, which are used to manage the majority of its transactional volume. The warehouse operating systems have improved U.S. Healthcare Solutions\u2019 productivity and operating leverage.  Competition We face a highly competitive global environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services. Our largest competitors are McKesson Corporation (\"McKesson\"), Cardinal Health,\u00a0Inc. (\"Cardinal\"), and UPS Logistics, among others. Our U.S. human health distribution businesses compete with both McKesson and Cardinal, as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution. In addition, we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers, chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing, specialty distributors, and packaging and healthcare technology companies. World Courier, MWI Animal Health, Alliance Healthcare, and our consulting businesses also face competition from a variety of entities. In all areas, competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added service programs, service and delivery, credit terms, and customer support. Intellectual Property We use a number of trademarks and service marks. All of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the United States and, in some cases, in foreign jurisdictions, or are the subject of pending applications for registration. We have developed or acquired various proprietary products, processes, software, and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers. We generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret, patent and copyright laws, and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections. We hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products, particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment, our medication and supply dispensing equipment, certain warehousing equipment, and some of our proprietary packaging solutions. We seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate. Although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties, third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time. Human Capital Resources Our ability to succeed in the global marketplace depends on attracting and retaining a talented and skilled workforce. We aspire to accelerate business results by fostering a diverse and an inclusive workplace, where all members of our global talent are supported and inspired to perform at their full potential and contribute to our success as their authentic selves. Workforce As of September\u00a030, 2023, we had approximately 46,000 employees, of which approximately 42,000 were full-time employees and approximately 37% were U.S.-based employees. 5 5 5 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Approximately 28% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, nearly all of whom are employees located outside of the United States. We encourage and embrace different cultures and backgrounds, as we recognize the value of employing a workforce of unique and varying viewpoints and experiences. As of September 30, 2023, individuals who self-identify as female made up the majority of Cencora\u2019s global workforce and Executive Management Committee, at 52% and 57%, respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2023, 52% of our U.S. workforce were individuals who self-identify as ethnically and/or racially diverse. We currently have three members of our Board of Directors who self-identify as ethnically and/or racially diverse, and we currently have four members of our Board of Directors who self-identify as female.  Talent Development We consider employee development to be a strategic priority. We support employee growth and advancement by offering a variety of benefits to eligible full-time employees including, among others: \u2022Leadership and professional development programs and resources; \u2022Leadership and executive coaching;  \u2022Tuition reimbursement; \u2022Opportunities to volunteer and participate in mentorship and support programs such as our employee resource groups (\"ERGs\");  \u2022Recognition for excellence, such as our annual Pursuit of Purpose awards and True Blue team member recognition program; and  \u2022Personalized learning and skill-building programs offered through our global learning experience platform. Importantly, we continue to make meaningful investments in supporting and building our talent and enhancing our culture. In fiscal 2023, we conducted an Employee Experience survey across the Company to gauge employee satisfaction and identify areas in which we can enhance and improve employee experience. This survey also included a Global Inclusion Index that was comprised of questions designed to measure inclusion across the organization. The Employee Experience Survey is the foundation for our new employee listening strategy to ensure employee voices are heard and valued in shaping our Company\u2019s culture. Our overarching goal is to provide our team members with clear pathways for career development, access to programs and benefits that allow them to live fuller, healthier lives, and opportunities to participate in their communities in ways that are meaningful to them and celebrate their individuality. Our talent development programs are designed to help provide a supportive and engaging work environment where team members can excel, while remaining authentic and empowered to share their unique perspectives and experiences. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\"DEI\") Our long-term DEI strategy is focused on four critical dimensions \u2014 people, culture, progress, and community \u2014 and is grounded in deep organizational insights, our people data, and industry research and benchmarks. In pursuit of this strategy, throughout fiscal 2023, our DEI Center of Excellence: \u2022Hosted three global celebrations to unite our team members around the world and foster our inclusive culture. \u25e6For Pride Month, we co-hosted a global event with the LGBTAllies ERG. Global leaders from Cencora celebrated LGBTQ+ contributions to our communities with more than 2,100 attendees from 16 countries participating.  \u25e6For International Women\u2019s Day, we co-hosted a global event with the Women\u2019s Impact Network (WIN) ERG. Global leaders from Cencora and a keynote speaker from the United Nations Foundation shared the important work we are doing to advance gender equality with more than 1,700 attendees from 37 countries joining the celebration.  \u25e6We gathered over 2,300 team members representing 26 countries to celebrate our global inclusion journey during a live, virtual event. Together, we learned about what drives a culture of inclusion and how we can all be more inclusive.  6 6 6 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  \u2022Released our second annual DEI Report, which represented our DEI achievements from fiscal 2022 with a specific focus on increasing transparency around our highly inclusive, global culture, as well as the diversity among our people that enables innovation and growth. \u2022Launched a new required training to support all team members in having the tools and knowledge to activate inclusion in alignment with our fiscal 2023 enterprise goals. \u2022Connected with more than 400 people in the International Business Group (IBG) to host listening sessions about team members\u2019 experiences, perspectives on DEI, and ideas on how we can continuously improve our highly inclusive, global culture and host DEI and business-integration workshops for senior leaders and HR professionals.  In addition to the foregoing, our DEI Global Council: \u2022Assessed our company\u2019s baseline accessibility across our digital ecosystem to identify areas of opportunity and shared year-to-date contributions in strengthening our commitment to disability inclusion, which culminated in the recognition of our organization as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by Disability:IN. \u2022Supported the integration of DEI strategies across our HR Shared Services and Legal teams through the creation of a manager guide for disability accommodations under the American with Disabilities Act. \u2022Enhanced the voluntary self-ID options in our human capital management software by adding gender identity and pronouns to be more inclusive of our transgender and nonbinary team members.  \u2022Supported the launch of a pilot program that focuses on developing talent through management accelerators for Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian American Pacific Islander leaders. Our eight\u202fERGs also hosted numerous events and activities to celebrate the shared backgrounds and experiences that our team members have in common, with the goal of giving everyone at Cencora a greater sense of belonging.  We are proud that our DEI efforts continue to be recognized. In 2023, we scored 100 on the Disability Equality Index, which is a joint initiative of Disability:IN and the American Association of People with Disabilities that measures disability inclusion in the workplace. Competitive Compensation and Benefits We are committed to ensuring equal opportunity and pay equity. We have implemented processes that are designed to drive equitable pay decisions and eliminate unexplained pay inequities. To further support this, Cencora has a cross-functional team of leaders from the Global Compensation, Legal, and Human Resource departments that is responsible for researching best practices, reviewing pay practices, working with external resources to analyze current pay equity, and working with senior leaders to implement changes. As a result of these efforts, we have: \u2022Modified promotional salary increase guidelines to help eliminate pay gaps;  \u2022Removed questions about pay history in the recruiting and interviewing processes of external candidates;    \u2022Adopted the practices of administering annual merit increases based on both performance and base pay within the pay range and making promotional salary increases based on market competitiveness and internal equity; and  \u2022Implemented annual assessments that identify potential pay gaps, with the goal of developing a plan to correct any identified pay gaps that are inexplicable.  Our comprehensive benefit and compensation package offers the following to all eligible full-time team members:  \u2022Medical, dental, and vision care, life insurance and other income protection, a retirement plan with Company match, and a discounted employee stock purchase program; \u2022An employee assistance program with free counseling sessions and unlimited digital mental health support, tuition assistance (including scholarships for dependents), medical coverage for same and opposite gender domestic partners, and holidays and paid time off; \u2022Infertility coverage and family building counseling services, as well as reimbursement for adoption expenses;  7 7 7 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  \u2022Counseling and education guidance benefits to support the needs of team members and dependents with developmental and cognitive challenges;  \u2022A minimum of twelve weeks of paid parental leave following birth, adoption, or surrogacy for both parents; \u2022Two weeks of paid caregiver leave to care for a family member who has a serious health condition; and  \u2022Back-up child and elder care, plus discounts on services, such as childcare, saving for college, and tutoring. We also believe it is important to invest in the health and wellness of our team members. Our myWellbeing program focuses on the physical, emotional, financial, and social aspects of wellness. Team members can earn points towards a reduction in health insurance premium costs by completing activities, such as monthly challenges and getting preventive exams and screenings. We also offer diabetes, weight management, and musculoskeletal programs for team members and their dependents. To help team members navigate the healthcare system, we provide a navigation and advocacy service to assist in finding the right care, obtaining a medical second opinion, and understanding medical bills.  WorkSmart, our principled workplace flexibility framework, informs how we work within our global organization. It has helped us win in the talent marketplace by broadening the diversity of our talent pools, driving higher levels of inclusion, and fostering a strong culture of trust and collaboration. We are committed to flexibility to best serve our customers and as a global driver of our employee experience, which differs in its application based upon unique country, culture, and regulatory requirements. Team Member Health and Wellbeing Our aim is to create a positive work environment where everyone can thrive and find opportunities to grow, learn, and pursue their passions while contributing to our purpose to create healthier futures. We are committed to the safety and wellbeing of our team members. In addition to utilizing a peer-to-peer safety program, we regularly convene our company leaders to review and evaluate safety data and issue operational excellence scorecards. Distribution center team members receive training on proper safety procedures and incentive opportunities, with safety performance tracked and shared across the organization. Additionally, the Cencora Team Assistance Fund exists to help employees who are experiencing extreme financial hardship due to a catastrophic event outside of their control. Government Regulation We are subject to extensive oversight by United States, United Kingdom and European Union governmental entities and we are subject to, and affected by, a variety of laws, regulations, and policies. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), the U.S. Department of Justice, and various other federal and state authorities regulate the purchase, storage, and/or distribution of pharmaceutical products, including controlled substances. Wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid DEA licenses, meet various security and operating standards, and comply with regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, and distribution of controlled substances.  We and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act. The anti-kickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing, leasing, or ordering, induce a referral to purchase, lease, or order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The False Claims Act prohibits knowingly submitting, or causing the submission, of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government and authorizes treble damages and substantial civil penalties in the case of violations. The fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation. In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain. These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, diverted, adulterated, or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. At the federal level, the supply chain security legislation known as the Drug Quality and Security Act (\"DQSA\") became law in 2013. Title II of the DQSA, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (\"DSCSA\"), establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level, preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and requires all supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable prescription drug traceability system. The DSCSA also establishes requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed third-party logistics providers. The FDA issued a proposed rule on February 4, 2022, which, when finalized, will establish national standards for the licensure of wholesale drug distributors and third-party logistics providers. Eventually, many comparable state  8 8 8 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  agencies will promulgate implementing regulations governing wholesale distributor and third-party logistics providers. There can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with DQSA requirements, or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements, and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our operations into compliance. These and other requirements will continue to increase the cost of our operations. The regulation of public and private health insurance and benefit programs can also affect our business, and scrutiny of the healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems in the United States, including those related to the importation and reimportation of certain drugs from foreign markets, can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels. This process may result in additional legislation and/or regulation governing the production, delivery, or pricing of pharmaceutical products and other healthcare services. In addition, changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or the discontinuation of our ability to continue to operate certain of our distribution centers, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any future reductions in Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us. We cannot predict what additional initiatives, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us. We are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices.
