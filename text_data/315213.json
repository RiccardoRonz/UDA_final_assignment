{"cik": 315213, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business  Robert Half International Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) provides specialized talent solutions and business consulting services through the Robert Half\u00ae and Protiviti\u00ae company names. The Company\u2019s business was originally founded in 1948. Prior to 1986, the Company was primarily a franchisor, under the names Accountemps and Robert Half, with offices providing contract and permanent professionals in the fields of accounting and finance. Beginning in 1986, the Company and its current management embarked on a strategy of acquiring the franchised locations. All franchises have since been acquired. The Company believes that direct ownership of offices allows it to better monitor and protect the image of its trade names, promote a more consistent and higher level of quality and service throughout its network of offices and improve profitability by centralizing many of its administrative functions. Since 1986, the Company has significantly expanded operations at many of the acquired locations, opened hundreds of new locations, and acquired other local or regional providers of specialized contract personnel. The Company has also broadened the scope of its services by expanding product offerings to include administrative and customer support, technology, financial project, and consulting and legal talent solutions.  Robert Half  Prior to 2022, the Company organized its talent solutions business (previously referred to as staffing) through separately branded divisions under the brand names of Accountemps\u00ae, Robert Half\u00ae Finance and Accounting, OfficeTeam\u00ae, Robert Half\u00ae Technology, Robert Half\u00ae Management Resources, Robert Half\u00ae Legal, and The Creative Group. During 2022 the Company unified its family of Robert Half brands to focus on its key brand, Robert Half. This simplifies the Company\u2019s go-to-market brand structure for clients and candidates, provides leverage for greater brand awareness, and allows future flexibility to expand the Company\u2019s existing functional specializations.   In connection with this process, the Company\u2019s current financial statement disclosures reflect new names for its reportable segments, including contract talent solutions (formerly temporary and consultant staffing), permanent placement talent solutions (formerly permanent placement staffing), and Protiviti (formerly risk consulting and internal audit services). Further information on these business segments follows.  Contract talent solutions  Robert Half\u2019s contract talent solutions business specializes in the provision of contract engagement professionals in the fields of finance and accounting, technology, marketing and creative, legal and administrative and customer support. Operationally, the Company\u2019s contract talent solutions are organized into the following functional specializations:  \u25e6Finance and Accounting \u25e6Technology \u25e6Marketing and Creative1 \u25e6Legal1 \u25e6Administrative and Customer Support   1 In the Company\u2019s financial statements, both Marketing and Creative and Legal functional specializations are reported within Finance and Accounting.  Businesses view the use of contract talent as a means of controlling personnel costs and converting such costs from fixed to variable. The cost and administrative burden to clients are significantly reduced by the use of contract talent resources. The contract talent engagement professionals are employees of Robert Half and are paid by Robert Half. The customer pays a fixed rate only for hours worked. Robert Half clients may fill their employment needs by using an employee on a trial basis and, if so desired, converting the contract position to a permanent position. The client typically pays a one-time fee for such conversions.  Finance and Accounting offers customers a reliable and economical means of dealing with uneven or peak workloads for accounting, finance, and accounting operations personnel caused by such predictable events as vacations, taking inventories, tax work, month-end activities, special projects, and such unpredictable events as illness and emergencies. Finance and Accounting also provides senior-level engagement professionals in the accounting, finance, and business systems fields, including chief financial officers, controllers, senior financial analysts, internal auditors, and business systems analysts, for such tasks as financial systems conversions, business process re-engineering, business systems performance improvement and post-merger financial consolidation. 1 1 1    Technology provides information technology contract professionals and offers managed services in areas ranging from multiple platform systems integration to end-user technical and desktop support, including specialists in software and application development, networking and cloud, systems integration and deployment, database design and administration, and security and business continuity.  Marketing and Creative includes the provision of creative professionals in the areas of creative, digital, marketing, advertising, and public relations in a variety of positions, such as creative directors, graphic designers, web designers, media buyers, front-end developers, copywriters, digital marketing managers, marketing analytics specialists, brand managers, and public relations specialists.  Legal provides legal contract talent, including attorneys and paralegal professionals. The legal profession\u2019s requirements (the need for confidentiality, accuracy and reliability, a strong drive toward cost-effectiveness, and frequent peak caseload periods) are similar to the demands of Finance and Accounting clients.  Administrative and Customer Support provides contract office and administrative personnel, ranging from executive and administrative assistants to receptionists and customer service representatives. Administrative and Customer Support operates in a similar fashion to Finance and Accounting.  Permanent placement talent solutions  The Company\u2019s first division, established in 1948, was Robert Half\u00ae Finance & Accounting which specialized in the placement of full-time accounting, finance, tax and accounting operations personnel. The Permanent placement talent solutions business (previously referred to as permanent placement staffing) is the modern incarnation of this pioneering business and encompasses the Company\u2019s full-time finance and accounting, technology, marketing and creative, legal and administrative and customer support placement business. Fees for successful placements are paid only by the employer and are generally a percentage of the new employee\u2019s annual compensation. No fee for placement services is charged to employment candidates. Permanent placement talent solutions operates under the Robert Half company name. Protiviti Protiviti is a global consulting firm that helps companies solve problems in finance, technology, operations, data, digital, legal, HR, governance, risk and internal audit, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In 2002, the Company hired more than 700 professionals who had been affiliated with the internal audit and business and technology risk consulting practice of Arthur Andersen LLP, including more than 50 individuals who had been partners of that firm. These professionals formed the base of the Company\u2019s Protiviti Inc. subsidiary. Protiviti has enabled the Company to enter the market for business consulting and internal audit services, and the Company believes this market offers synergies with its traditional lines of business. Protiviti delivers an expanding set of services across its defined solution offerings of internal audit, technology consulting, risk and compliance consulting, digital transformation, legal consulting, and business performance improvement. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms work collaboratively with its clients in over 25 countries to help them achieve their business objectives and deliver confidence in an ever-evolving and dynamic business world. Serving organizations across industry sectors, clients range from high-growth, pre-public/transactional established start-ups to the largest global companies and government entities. The Protiviti business was formerly referred to as the Company\u2019s risk consulting and internal audit services segment. Marketing and Recruiting The Company markets its contract talent services to clients and employment candidates via both national and local advertising activities, including radio, digital advertising, job boards, alliance partners, and events. The Company also markets its services via its website, blog and mobile app, as well as through targeted online tactics, email, and social media. Direct marketing to customers is a significant portion of the Company\u2019s total marketing efforts. Joint marketing arrangements have been entered into with major software manufacturers and typically provide for the development of proprietary skills tests, cooperative advertising, joint campaigns, and similar promotional activities. The Company also actively seeks endorsements and affiliations with professional organizations in the accounting and finance, technology, legal, and creative and marketing fields. The Company also conducts public relations activities designed to enhance public recognition of the Company and its services. Central to the public relations activities are research-based content, targeted media relations and thought leadership. Robert Half employees are encouraged to be active in civic organizations and industry trade groups in their local communities.  2 2 2   Protiviti markets its business consulting services to a variety of global clients in a range of industries. Industry and competency teams conduct targeted marketing efforts locally, nationally, and globally, including digital advertising, search advertising, email marketing, production and distribution of thought leadership, social media, and live and virtual speaking events. Protiviti regularly conducts a variety of programs to share its insights with clients on current and emerging business issues. Protiviti also markets its capabilities through its broad partner ecosystem of professional associations and complimentary service and technology providers. It conducts public relations activities, including distributing press releases, sharing proprietary research findings and providing subject-matter experts for press interviews designed to enhance recognition of Protiviti\u2019s brand and reputation, establish its expertise in key issues surrounding its businesses and promote its services. Protiviti promotes its brand name through digital and out-of-home advertising and its professional golf brand ambassador program. Protiviti regularly updates the services, value-added content and digital experience on the Protiviti websites globally. Employees are encouraged to be active in relevant social media communities, charitable and civic organizations and industry trade groups. The Company and its subsidiaries own many trademarks and service marks, including the Robert Half\u00ae Finance\u00a0& Accounting, Accountemps\u00ae, OfficeTeam\u00ae, Robert Half\u00ae Technology, Robert Half\u00ae Management Resources, Robert Half\u00ae Legal, The Creative Group\u00ae and Protiviti\u00ae marks, which are registered in the United States and in a number of foreign countries. Organization Management of the Company\u2019s contract talent solutions and permanent placement talent solutions operations is coordinated from its headquarters facilities in Menlo Park and San Ramon, California. The Company\u2019s headquarters provides support and centralized services to its offices in the administrative, marketing, public relations, accounting, information technology, training and legal areas, particularly as it relates to the standardization of the operating procedures of its offices. As of December\u00a031, 2022, the Company conducted its contract talent and permanent placement services operations through 317\u00a0offices in 42\u00a0states, the District of Columbia, and 18\u00a0foreign countries. Office managers are responsible for most activities of their offices, including business development, local advertising and marketing, and recruitment. The day-to-day operations of Protiviti are managed by a chief executive officer and a senior management team with operational and administrative support provided by individuals located in Menlo Park and San Ramon, California. As of December\u00a031, 2022, Protiviti had 65\u00a0offices in 23\u00a0states and 13\u00a0foreign countries. Competition The Company\u2019s contract talent solutions and permanent placement talent solutions businesses face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates. The staffing business is highly competitive, with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by Robert Half on a national, regional, or local basis. In many areas,  local companies are the strongest competitors. The most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service, both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel. The expanded acceptance of remote work has created a significant opportunity for the Company. It brings together the Company\u2019s numerous strengths, including its global brand, global office network, global candidate database, and advanced artificial intelligence driven technologies and data analytics at the scale needed to excel at out-of-market recruitment and placements. This strengthens the Company\u2019s competitive position significantly since its traditionally toughest competitors, local and regional staffing firms, generally do not have these capabilities. Protiviti faces competition in its efforts to attract clients, expand relationships with existing clients, and win new business proposals. The global professional services market is highly competitive with a dynamic regulatory environment, disruptive new technologies, security and privacy concerns, and high demand for skilled professionals, all driving significant business opportunities. The principal competitors of Protiviti remain the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms and other consultancies. Significant competitive factors include reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services, and depth of skills of personnel. Protiviti believes its competitive strengths lie in the collaborative approach it takes to working with clients, which drives knowledge transfer, understanding of client issues, and value creation. This may be coupled with a \u201cconfigure-to-fit\u201d resourcing model to create blended teams of full-time Protiviti consulting professionals and engagement professionals from Robert Half\u2019s network of specialized talent to precisely match expertise, approach and people to the changing global needs of clients on consulting and managed solutions projects.  3 3 3   Human Capital Management Employees.    The Company had approximately 16,300 full-time internal staff, including approximately 7,000 employees engaged directly in Protiviti operations, as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company placed approximately 164,200 engagement professionals (which includes full time engagement professionals) on assignments with clients during 2022. The substantial majority of engagement professionals placed on assignment by the Company are the Company\u2019s legal employees while they are working on assignments, but references to \u201cemployees\u201d in the remainder of the Human Capital Management section refer to the Company\u2019s full-time internal staff. With respect to engagement professionals, the Company pays the related costs of employment, such as workers\u2019 compensation insurance, state and federal unemployment taxes, social security, and certain fringe benefits. The Company also provides access to voluntary health insurance coverage to interested engagement professionals.   Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.    The Company believes that its rich culture of diversity, equity and inclusion enables it to leverage the strengths of its workforce while also creating an environment where employees can connect, thrive, and grow. In 2022, we continued our support of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge and furthered our commitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion by establishing new strategic alliances with Black is Tech, Upward Women, and Hire Heroes. Current key initiatives include integrating DEI into learning programs, deepening the reach of our Employee Network Groups (\u201cENGs\u201d), and a focus on external strategic alliances to increase engagement and representation of underrepresented communities. The Company places a high value on inclusion, engaging employees in its ENG programs. These ENGs provide a forum for employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences, or characteristics who share a common interest in professional development, improving corporate culture, and delivering sustained business results. The Company also uses these groups to support the acquisition of diverse talent internally and externally. Each ENG is sponsored and supported by senior leaders across the enterprise. Across Robert Half and Protiviti, there are now 16 Employee Network Groups spanning women, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and mental health and well-being.  Across both Robert Half and Protiviti, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 54.4% of the Company's global workforce was female and 47.1% of the Company\u2019s employees in managerial and leadership roles were female. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 34.0% of the Company's U.S. workforce was from underrepresented groups. Employee Engagement.    A major component in supporting Employee Engagement is the Robert Half employee voice initiative to provide its employees with feedback opportunities. In 2022, the Company conducted two surveys to understand employee needs and gather feedback on a variety of focus areas. The survey results were analyzed by an independent third-party and then reviewed by the executive officers. The results of these engagement surveys were shared with individual managers, who were then tasked with taking action based on their employees\u2019 confidential feedback (both quantitative and qualitative). In 2022, Robert Half and Protiviti formalized new hire surveys at specific points in a new hire's onboarding and departure surveys to exiting employees. By paying close attention to the results both at an aggregate enterprise level and at a department/business/workgroup level, across an employee\u2019s life cycle, the Company has been able to enhance its culture of rewards and recognition, drive efforts to promote inclusion and diversity, increase communication in support of employee well-being and modernize its approach to foster a culture of continuous learning and feedback. In addition, Robert Half expanded its participation in the Great Place to Work\u00ae Survey to include all country locations to benchmark with other companies.  Under its Leading with Empathy initiative, Protiviti uses an \u201cask, listen, respond, act\u201d approach to building trust through global surveys where employees provide anonymous feedback. Employee feedback is then carefully reviewed and analyzed to identify trends, which are shared with senior leaders and communicated directly to employees. Actions being taken based on employee feedback are highlighted so that employees understand the importance of their input. Protiviti leverages surveys in the U.S. and internationally, including the Great Place to Work\u00ae survey. Learning and Development.    The Company emphasizes employee development and training as a priority for both our people and for the organization. Training and development are key elements to the overall retention, engagement, and employee experience strategy. Our strategy is designed to empower employees to reach their full potential, and we provide a wide range of development programs, opportunities, and resources needed to be successful. The Company has specialized programs for all audiences, including new hires, tenured employees, and leadership. We provide mentorship opportunities, self-paced and instructor-led learning channels, and a catalog of vendor-provided courses, videos, resources, and books. The Company is committed to its employees' overall health and providing career progression by providing individual development, readiness, and transition plans as a part of its talent review and succession planning process. As a result of our flexible working environment in 2022, our learning strategy supports access and equity to all our employees through both in-person and virtual learning experiences. In 2022 we introduced comprehensive learning maps for the first year of our new hires and our front-line leaders which provide a more consistent, predictable and formal learning experience. We continued to deploy learning that supports our flexible working environment by providing both virtual and in-person learning opportunities. Our learning strategy supports equity of access, just in time learning and continued career development for our employees.  4 4 4   In Protiviti, at key career milestones, employees may participate in engaging learning events that prepare them to succeed at higher levels. Each employee is assigned a career advisor who coaches them and recommends actions to help them increase their impact, contribution, and engagement. Protiviti encourages and pays for employees to attain select recognized professional certifications. Annual operating plans include learning budget funding for employees. These investments in the skills of our workforce also pay dividends in the marketplace and with our clients who value and rely upon our expertise.  Compensation, Benefits and Well-being.    The Company offers fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support its employees\u2019 overall well-being. To align with management\u2019s short- and long-term objectives the Company\u2019s compensation programs for all employees include competitive base pay and for some employees, short-term and long-term incentives. The Company offers a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare programs, generous time-off and leave, and retirement and financial support. The Company provides emotional well-being services through its Employee Assistance Program as well as a number of perks and other convenience benefits. As an outcome of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic we made a global shift to remote work models.  We put people first by providing work options that support professional and personal needs.  Subject to business requirements, employees have flexibility and choice to work where they feel comfortable and productive \u2013 remote, in-office or a hybrid approach.  This model is based on fairness and equity, with a goal of allowing for a consistent employee experience, regardless of where one works.    Other Information The Company is not dependent upon a single customer or a limited number of customers. The Company\u2019s talent solutions  business is generally more active in the first and fourth quarters of a calendar year. Protiviti is generally more active in the third and fourth quarters of a calendar year. Order backlog is not a material aspect of the Company\u2019s talent solutions business. Backlog is of greater importance to Protiviti and is typically realized within a 12-month period.
