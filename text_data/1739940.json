The last couple of years have reoriented every person, every organization and every community toward a deeper relationship with health. We believe that achieving both health and vitality for those we serve must fuel the actions of our over 70,000 colleagues around the world, each and every day. We have two growth platforms: Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare. Evernorth Health Services is our pharmacy, care and benefits solution that is highly attractive to our clients and partners because of the depth of its capabilities and expertise. Evernorth Health Services also enables us to deepen existing relationships across our entire book of business. Cigna Healthcare is the health benefits provider of The Cigna Group, serving customers and clients for our U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health operating segments, and it allows us to harness our partnership relationship with physicians to deliver affordable and coordinated health care to employers and individuals.  Together, Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare provide a strong and diverse foundation that allows us to capitalize on growth opportunities by leading with our strengths \u2013 medical and pharmacy solutions \u2013 and then expanding those relationships by addressing additional client needs and innovating and delivering new services and solutions. To transform the differentiated value we deliver to our customers, patients, clients, communities and investors into attractive, sustained growth, we continue to cultivate our portfolio of businesses with the goal of consistently delivering the foundational growth, accelerated growth and opportunity for cross-enterprise leverage we expect today and in the future. When considering our broad portfolio of businesses, we have strong foundational businesses that will continue to grow. These businesses often serve as the key entry point for clients with either a  1 1 1   pharmacy relationship, a medical relationship or both. We also have a variety of accelerated growth businesses, both scaled and emerging, which build upon our foundational relationships or provide exposure to adjacent high-growth areas. Our cross-enterprise leverage provides us with an opportunity to unlock even more value as the combined power of the franchise is unleashed. The Cigna Group's employees are champions for the people we serve and over the past decade, our focus has shifted to helping individuals and families thrive by offering solutions to prevent and better manage health challenges. When sickness or disability do occur, we support our customers by offering broad choices to help them best access high quality, affordable, whole person care. We see three primary ways to help individuals maintain, improve or recover their physical or mental health: 1) behavioral and lifestyle changes \u2013 with health coaches helping individuals set and meet health goals; 2) affordable, effective medication options \u2013 with access to our leading pharmacy services improving health and driving affordability; and 3) targeted medical and surgical interventions \u2013 with a clear and proven strategy around partnerships and value-based care quality programs, powered by data and analytics and aligned incentives. We maximize use of evidence-based care, while delivering best-in-class service for our customers with acute and chronic conditions through enhanced real-time insights across an expanded platform with industry-leading solutions to support care decisions. Our portfolio of offerings solves diverse challenges across the health care system. We offer a differentiated set of pharmacy, medical, behavioral, dental and supplemental products and services, primarily through two growth platforms: Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare. Our capabilities include: 1) a broad portfolio of solutions and services, some of which can be offered on a stand-alone basis; 2) integrated behavioral, medical and pharmacy management solutions; 3) leading specialty pharmacy, clinical and care management expertise; and 4) advanced analytics that help us engage more meaningfully with individuals, the plan sponsors we serve and our provider partners.  We differentiate ourselves in the market through a number of capabilities. We improve whole-person health, in body and mind by treating physical and behavioral health together to improve outcomes and by providing early behavioral and lifestyle interventions. We make it easier to access quality care by improving navigation at every step in a patient's health journey and by meeting customers wherever they are - virtually, digitally and in home. We connect care for the most pressing conditions by closing gaps between hospitals, primary care providers, specialists and other health care providers. We also develop personalized treatment paths across every dimension of care. We continue to build upon our network of value-based provider arrangements for better customer experiences, better overall health outcomes and greater affordability, with a significant number of our eligible customers aligned to our Accountable Care programs nationally. We make medicine more affordable by reducing costs from start to finish, including those related to drug access, delivery and treatment and by identifying appropriate medication alternatives. We partner and innovate to enable us to deliver differentiated value and broaden our reach in new geographies or through the introduction of new solutions and offerings. Our key to success revolves around how deeply we care about our customers, patients and co-workers. We intend to create a better future together by innovating and adapting, acting with speed and purpose, partnering, collaborating and keeping our promises.

Express Scripts Pharmacy dispenses approximately 1.6 billion adjusted prescriptions(1) annually to members of pharmacy plans managed by our Express Scripts PBM. We drive high-quality, cost-effective care through prescription drug utilization and cost management services. We support our clients' plan design selections to deliver balanced affordability, choice, simplicity and convenience. We focus our solutions to align with our clients' service, care and cost management needs. As a result, we believe we deliver better care, healthier outcomes, higher customer satisfaction and a more affordable prescription drug benefit. We dispense drug claims via Express Scripts Pharmacy, Accredo and our retail networks by integrating retail network pharmacy administration, benefit design consultation, drug utilization review, drug formulary management and pharmacy fulfillment services. We administer payments to retail networks and bill benefits costs to our clients through our end-to-end adjudication services. \u25e6Drug Utilization Review Program. When pharmacies submit claims for prescription drugs to us, we review them electronically in real time for health and safety. We then alert the dispensing pharmacy of any detected issues. Clients may also choose to enroll in programs that result in communications about potential therapy concerns being sent to prescribers after the initial claim submission. \u25e6Benefits Design Consultation. We consult with our clients on how best to structure and leverage the pharmacy benefit to meet plan objectives for affordable access to the prescription medications customers need to stay healthy and to ensure the safe and effective use of those medications. \u25e6myMatrixx. myMatrixx is a unique PBM with an exclusive focus on workers' compensation. We combine high-touch customer service with clinical expertise and state-of-the-art business intelligence systems to deliver simplified solutions and positive outcomes. myMatrixx leverages Express Scripts' robust pharmacy network and provides a smooth and personalized experience for clients and injured workers.  (1) Non-specialty network scripts filled through 90-day programs and home delivery scripts are multiplied by three. All other network and specialty scripts are counted as one script. 5 5 5   \u25e6Medical Drug Management.

Our solutions apply utilization management, site of care management and claims prepayment review to effectively reduce wasteful spend, while providing services tailored to customers ensuring safety and healthier outcomes. We also offer Express Scripts MedRx Management, a suite of solutions and consultative services for medical rebates contracting, medically-billed drug preferencing and value-based contracting. \u25e6Embarc Benefit Protection. Embarc shields clients and members from the high costs of life-saving gene therapies, so that customers who need treatment can get it. Additionally, the program provides access to quality, cost-effective in-network providers and support from a dedicated gene therapy case management team. \u25e6FamilyPath. FamilyPath is raising the bar for fertility health by providing more comprehensive and more flexible coverage and proactive care for growing families, including expanded medical and pharmacy benefit management; access to vetted provider and lab networks; and dedicated Fertility Advisors to proactively support and guide customers. \u25e6Retail Network Pharmacy Administration. We contract with retail pharmacies to provide prescription drugs to customers of the pharmacy benefit plans we manage. We negotiate with pharmacies throughout the United States to discount drug prices provided to customers and manage national and regional networks responsive to client preferences related to cost containment, convenience of access for customers and network performance. We also manage networks of pharmacies customized for or under direct contract with specific clients and have contracted with pharmacy provider networks to comply with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") access requirements for the federal Medicare Part D prescription drug program (\"Medicare Part D\"). All retail pharmacies in our network communicate with us online and in real-time to process prescription drug claims.  \u25e6Drug Formulary Management. Formularies are lists of drugs with designations that may be used to determine drug coverage, customer out-of-pocket costs and communicate plan preferences in competitive drug categories. Our formulary management\u00a0services support clients in establishing formularies that assist customers and physicians in choosing clinically-appropriate, cost-effective drugs and prioritize access, safety and affordability. We administer specific formularies on behalf of our clients, including standard formularies developed and offered by Express Scripts and custom formularies in which we play a more limited role. Most of our clients select standard formularies, governed by our National Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee, which is comprised of a panel of independent physicians and pharmacists in active clinical practice representing a variety of specialties and practice settings, typically with major academic affiliations. In making formulary recommendations, this committee considers only the drug's safety and efficacy and not the cost of the drug, including any negotiated manufacturer discount or rebate arrangement. This process is designed to ensure the clinical recommendation is not affected by our financial arrangements. We fully comply with this committee's clinical recommendations regarding drugs that must be included or excluded from the formulary based on their assessment of safety and efficacy. \u25e6Advanced Utilization Management. These programs include prior authorization, drug quantity management and step therapy designed to decrease client spend on pharmacy. \u25e6Enhanced Fraud, Waste & Abuse. We help plan sponsors identify potential problem customers and prescribers with unusual or excessive utilization patterns. The program is designed to help identify outliers and situations of abnormal use or prescribing patterns by analyzing types of prescriptions, refill patterns and pharmacy utilization. \u25e6Administration of Group Purchasing Organizations. We operate various group purchasing organizations that negotiate pricing for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and formulary rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of their participants. They also provide various administrative services to their participants including management and reporting. \u25e6Copay Solutions. Our first-to-market innovative copay solutions help customers afford their medications, protect plan design preferences and achieve lower trend. Our partnership with SaveOnSP on the first non-essential health benefits copay assistance solution has driven significant savings by targeting high-cost, high-volume drugs. SaveOnSP recommends plan design and coverage changes for certain drugs, enabling maximum savings and reducing plan and client costs. As manufacturer programs and regulations change, this aggressive solution adapts, delivering lower specialty plan cost and enhanced customer support. \u25e6Inside Rx. Inside Rx is a prescription medication savings program that offers eligible self-paying customers discounts on many brand and generic medications. This program is not insurance but offers savings at more than 60,000 participating retail pharmacies (including all major chains) in the United States and Puerto Rico. The program also offers discounts on prescription medications through private label solutions. Inside Rx earns a small fee from our supply chain partners every time a customer fills a prescription via the program.

We offer a solution platform aimed at therapy classes that pose budgetary threats and clinical challenges to customers. Our solutions are designed to keep our clients ahead of the drug cost curve while providing customers the personalized care and access they need. These solutions are offered throughout our pharmacy benefit management services and include, but are not limited to care for: cardiovascular, diabetes, hepatitis, HIV, inflammatory conditions, neurological, multiple sclerosis, oncology, pulmonary, rare conditions and weight management. Innovative programs, such as Express Scripts SafeGuardRx, combine utilization management, formulary management, specialized care from our Therapeutic Resource Centers and financial savings, to help us to change the market in key categories. These services optimize the safe and appropriate dispensing of therapeutic agents, minimize waste and improve clinical and financial outcomes. \u25aaExpress Scripts Patient Assurance Program. This program addresses affordability challenges for customers managing their diabetes and cardiovascular conditions by providing a lower, fixed, out-of-pocket cost directly to the customer. Express Scripts negotiates additional discounts to reduce customer cost share without increasing plan cost, and applies those discounts at the point of service. By making the cost of medication affordable and predictable, the Express Scripts Patient Assurance Program improves medication adherence, driving better customer outcomes and lower downstream medical costs for the plan. \u2022Home Delivery Pharmacy. Evernorth Health Services offers free standard shipping of medications nationwide, usually in a 90-day supply, directly to the customer's home and allows for automatic refills on eligible medications and unrestricted telephone access to over 4,000 customer care advocates and specially trained pharmacists to answer customer questions.

Our high-volume automated dispensing pharmacies are located in Arizona, Indiana, Missouri and New Jersey. \u2022Specialty Pharmacy. Specialty medications are primarily characterized as high-cost medications for the treatment of complex and rare diseases. These medications broadly include those with frequent dosing adjustments, intensive clinical monitoring, the need for customer training, specialized product administration requirements or medications limited to certain specialty pharmacy networks by manufacturers. The front-end of our pharmacy is organized into Therapeutic Resource Centers, where pharmacists focus their practice of pharmacy by condition, which offers customers a more personalized experience while providing enhanced clinical care. Through a combination of assets and capabilities, we work to provide an enhanced level of predictable care and therapy management for customers taking specialty medications, leading to increased visibility and improved outcomes for payors and custom programs for biopharmaceutical manufacturers. The launch of biosimilars to blockbuster specialty therapies provides competition and an opportunity to drive down costs for both customers and clients. We work closely with clients to efficiently support each benefit design to improve affordability. Accredo is focused on dispensing injectable, infused, oral and inhaled drugs that require a higher level of clinical service and support than traditional pharmacies typically offer. Accredo supports successful outcomes for customers and reduces waste for clients through specialty trained clinicians, a nationwide footprint and a network of in-home nursing services, reimbursement and customer assistance programs and biopharmaceutical services.

Customers We provide products and services in the Evernorth Health Services segment to clients and customers, as described below. Also described below are our significant clients. \u2022Clients. We provide services to managed care organizations, health insurers, third-party administrators, employers, union-sponsored benefit plans, workers' compensation plans, government health programs, providers, clinics, hospitals and others. We provide services to a majority of customers in our Cigna Healthcare segment. \u2022Customers. Prescription drugs are dispensed to patients connected to the service offerings we provide to clients. Prescription drugs are dispensed primarily through networks of retail pharmacies under non-exclusive contracts with us and via home delivery from Express Scripts Pharmacy and specialty drug fulfillment pharmacies. The Department of Defense (\"DoD\") TRICARE\u00ae Pharmacy Program is the military health care program serving active-duty service customers, National Guard and Reserve customers and retirees, as well as their dependents. Under this contract, we provide online claims adjudication, home delivery services, specialty pharmacy clinical services, claims processing and contact center support and other services critical to managing pharmacy trend. In 2021, the DoD awarded Express Scripts a seven-year pharmacy program contract beginning January 1, 2023. Under the new contract, Express Scripts will provide enhanced specialty care and expanded care coordination capabilities, while continuing to support current pharmacy operations, through 2029. Revenues from this contract are significant to the segment. In 2019, Express Scripts and Prime Therapeutics LLC (\"Prime\") entered into an agreement effective on April 1, 2020 to deliver improved choice and affordability for Prime's clients and their customers by enhancing retail pharmacy networks and pharmaceutical manufacturer value. In 2022, Prime and Express Scripts agreed to extend this relationship through 2025. In 2021, the relationship with Prime was expanded to include the option for Prime's plans to access the Accredo specialty pharmacy and Express Scripts home delivery in-network pharmacies. Revenues from these contracts are significant to the segment. In October 2022, Evernorth Health Services and Centene Corporation (\"Centene\") announced a multi-year agreement effective January 2024 to manage pharmacy benefit services and make prescription medications more accessible and affordable for Centene's approximately 20 million customers. In addition to greater savings on prescription drugs, Centene customers will also have access to Express Scripts' extensive national network of retail pharmacies. Competition The health care industry has undergone periods of substantial consolidation and may continue to consolidate in the future. Many of the largest managed care organizations now also own health services businesses that compete with Evernorth Health Services in the verticals in which we participate. We believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include the ability to: negotiate with retail pharmacies to ensure our retail pharmacy networks meet the needs of our clients and customers; provide home delivery and specialty pharmacy services; negotiate discounts and rebates on prescription drugs with drug manufacturers; navigate the complexities of government-reimbursed business including Medicare, Medicaid and the public exchanges; manage cost and quality of specialty drugs; and use the information we obtain about drug utilization patterns and consumer behavior to reduce costs for our clients and customers and assess the level of service we provide. \u2022Managed Care PBMs. CVS Caremark (owned by CVS Health Corporation (\"CVS\")), Humana Inc. (\"Humana\"), IngenioRx (owned by Elevance Health Inc. (\"Elevance\")), OptumRx (owned by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (\"UnitedHealth\")) and Prime Therapeutics (owned by a collection of Blue Cross / Blue Shield Plans) compete with us on a variety of products and in various regions throughout the United States. \u2022Independent PBMs. MedImpact, Navitus Health Solutions, Elixir (owned by Rite Aid Corporation) and many other regional PBMs compete with us on a variety of products across the United States. \u2022Pharmacies. CVS, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., WalMart, Inc., Rite Aid, Kroger and other independent pharmacies compete with us for the delivery of prescription drug needs to our customers. In addition, many PBMs own and operate home delivery and specialty pharmacies including CVS, OptumRx, Walgreens, Humana and Elixir. New entrants continue to emerge, including Amazon Pharmacy, Capsule and Hims. \u2022Third-Party Benefits Administrators. Third parties that specialize in claim adjudication and benefit administration, such as SS&C Health, are direct competitors. With the emergence of alternative benefit models through private exchanges, the competitive landscape also includes brokers, health plans and consultants. Some of these competitors may deploy greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do and new market entrants, including strategic alliances aimed at  9 9 9   modifying the current health care delivery models or entering the prescription drug sector from another sector of the health care industry, may increase competition as barriers to entry are relatively low. For example, GoodRx is an entrant focused on serving the uninsured and underinsured in the cash pay pharmacy administration space. \u2022Care Delivery and Management Solutions. OptumHealth, NaviHealth and Landmark (UnitedHealth); Beacon, Aspire and CareMore (owned by Elevance); CVS's HealthHubs and MinuteClinics; CenterWell Home Health (Humana); Community and Bayless (Centene); VillageMD, Teladoc, Doctor on Demand, MeMD, WalmartHealth and AmazonCare are among the companies that compete with us in this market. \u2022Clinical Solutions and Health Care Data Analytics Companies. Optum (owned by UnitedHealth), Elevance, Magellan Health and Apixio (owned by Centene Corporation), HealthHelp, Cotiviti and Inovalon are among the companies that compete with us in this market. Operations \u2022Sales and Account Management. Our sales and account management teams market and sell pharmacy benefit management solutions and are supported by client service representatives, clinical pharmacy managers and benefit analysis consultants. These teams work with clients to develop innovative strategies that put medicine within reach of customers while helping health benefit providers improve access to and affordability of prescription drugs. \u2022Supply Chain. Our supply chain contracting and strategy teams negotiate and manage pharmacy retail network contracts, pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing contracts and manufacturer rebate contracts. As our clients continue to experience increased cost trends, our supply chain teams develop innovative solutions such as our Express Scripts SafeGuardRx platform and preferred pharmacy networks to combat these cost increases. In addition, our Formulary Consulting team, consisting of pharmacists and financial analysts, provides services to our clients to support formulary decisions, benefit design consultation and utilization management programs. \u2022Clinical Support. Our staff of highly trained health care professionals provides clinical support for our pharmacy, medical and behavioral customers. Our services include access to: \u25e6Support for the individual and their caregivers from crisis care in their most vulnerable moments to stabilization and returning back to work and life for all involved \u25e6Comprehensive behavioral health offerings including network access, utilization management and coordination of care to treat conditions ranging from depression and anxiety to substance use, autism and eating disorders \u25e6Condition-specific specialized customer care through our Therapeutic Resource Center facilities staffed with specialist pharmacists, nurses and other clinicians \u25e6Clinical development and operational support for our pharmacy benefit management services by our clinical solutions staff of pharmacists and physicians who conduct a wide range of activities including: identifying emerging medication-related safety issues and alerting physicians, clients and customers (as appropriate); providing drug information services; managing formulary; identifying and closing gaps in care; and developing utilization management, safety (drug utilization review) and other clinical interventions Suppliers We maintain an inventory of brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals in our home delivery and specialty pharmacies. Our specialty pharmacies also carry biopharmaceutical products to meet the needs of our customers, including pharmaceuticals for the treatment of rare or chronic diseases; if a drug is not in our inventory, we can generally obtain it from a supplier within a reasonable amount of time. We purchase pharmaceuticals either directly from manufacturers or through authorized wholesalers. Evernorth Health Services uses one wholesaler more than others in the industry, but holds contracts with other wholesalers if needs for an alternate source arise. Generic pharmaceuticals are generally purchased directly from manufacturers.

HMO, LocalPlus\u00ae, Network and Open Access Plus plans use meaningful cost-sharing incentives to encourage the use of \"in-network\" versus \"out-of-network\" health care providers. The national provider network for Managed Care Plans is smaller than the national network used with the PPO plan product line. \u2022PPO Plans feature a network with broader provider access than the Managed Care Plans. \u2022Consumer-Driven Products are typically paired with a high-deductible medical plan and offer customers a tax-advantaged way to pay for eligible health care expenses. These products, consisting of health savings accounts, health reimbursement accounts and flexible spending accounts, encourage customers to play an active role in managing their health and health care costs. U.S. Government Medical \u2022Individual and Family Plans are Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") compliant exclusive provider organization (\"EPO\") or HMO plans marketed to individuals under age 65 who do not have access to health care coverage through an employer or government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Customers receive comprehensive health care benefits and have access to a local network of health care providers who have been selected with cost and quality in mind. \u2022Medicare Advantage Plans allow Medicare-eligible customers to receive health care benefits, including prescription drugs, through a managed care health plan such as our coordinated care plans. Our Medicare Advantage Plans include HMO and PPO plans marketed to individuals and qualified employer groups. A significant portion of our Medicare Advantage customers receive medical care from our value-based models that focus on developing highly engaged physician networks, aligning payment incentives to improve health outcomes and using timely and transparent data sharing. \u2022Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug (\"Part D\") Products provide a number of prescription drug plan options, as well as service and information support to Medicare-eligible individuals or individuals through a qualified employer group. Our stand-alone plans offer the coverage of Medicare combined with the flexibility to select a product that provides enhanced benefits and a formulary that aligns with the individual's needs. Eligible customers benefit from broad network access and enhanced service intended to promote adherence, wellness and affordability. \u2022Medicare Supplement Plans provide Medicare-eligible customers with federally standardized Medigap-style plans. Customers may select among the various plans with specific plan options to meet their unique needs and may visit, without the need for a referral, any health care provider or facility that accepts Medicare throughout the United States.  Specialty Products and Services \u2022Stop-Loss insurance coverage is offered to self-insured clients whose group health plans are administered by Cigna Healthcare. Stop-loss insurance provides reimbursement for claims in excess of a predetermined amount for individuals, the entire group, or both. \u2022Cost Containment Programs are designed to contain the cost of covered health care services and supplies. These programs reduce out-of-network utilization and costs, protect customers from balance billing and educate customers regarding the availability of lower cost in-network services. In addition, under these programs we negotiate discounts with out-of-network providers, review provider bills and recover overpayments. We charge fees for providing or arranging for these services. These programs may be administered by third-party vendors that have contracted with Cigna Healthcare. 13 13 13   \u2022Consumer Health Engagement services are offered to customers covered under plans administered by Cigna Healthcare or by third-party administrators. These services consist of an array of health management, disease management and wellness services.

We integrate our programs and services with medical and pharmacy programs to facilitate customized, holistic care as well as to provide resources that increase resiliency and address non-medical factors that affect overall well-being. \u2022Dental solutions include dental HMO plans, dental PPO plans, exclusive dental provider organization plans, traditional dental indemnity plans and a dental discount program. Employers and other groups can purchase our products on either an insured or self-insured basis as standalone products or in conjunction with medical products. Additionally, individual customers can purchase insured dental PPO plans as standalone products or in conjunction with individual medical policies.  International Health \u2022Global Health Care products and services include insurance and administrative services for medical, dental, pharmacy, vision and life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability risks. We are a leading provider of products and services that meet the needs of multinational employers, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations and globally mobile individuals with a focus on keeping employees healthy and productive. The employer benefits products and services are offered through guaranteed cost, experience-rated and administrative services only funding solutions, while individuals purchase guaranteed cost coverage. \u2022Local Health Care products and services include medical, dental, pharmacy and vision as well as life coverage. The customers of local health care businesses are employers and individuals located in specific countries where the products and services are purchased. These employer services can similarly be funded through a range of options; individuals purchase on a guaranteed cost basis. Revenues: Premiums and Fees \u2022ASO. Plan sponsors (i.e., employers, unions and other groups) self-fund all claims, but may purchase stop-loss insurance to limit exposure. We collect fees from plan sponsors for providing access to our participating provider network and for other services and programs including: claims administration; behavioral health services; disease management; utilization management; cost containment; dental and pharmacy benefit management. Approximately 85% of our U.S. Commercial medical customers are in ASO arrangements. \u2022Insured. GC and ER. In most states, individual and group insurance premium rates must be approved by the applicable state regulatory agency (typically a department of insurance). State or federal laws may restrict or limit the use of rating methods. Premium rates are established at the beginning of a policy period and, depending on group size, may be based in whole or in part on prior experience of the policyholder or on a pool of similar policyholders. With the exception of ER policies, we generally cannot subsequently adjust premiums to reflect actual claim experience until the next policy period; the policyholder does not participate, or share in, actual claim experience; and we keep any experience surplus or margin if costs are less than the premium charged (subject to minimum medical loss ratio rebate requirements discussed below). For all insured arrangements, we bear the risk for actual costs in excess of the premium charged. Approximately 15% of our U.S. Commercial medical customers are in insured arrangements.  For Medicare Advantage plans, we receive fixed monthly payments from CMS for each plan customer based on customer demographic data and actual customer health risk factors compared to the broader Medicare population. Premiums may be received from customers when our plan premium exceeds the revenue received from CMS. We also may earn additional revenue from CMS related to quality performance measures (known as \"Star Ratings\").   The ACA subjects individual and small group policy rate increases above an identified threshold to review by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"). Our U.S. Commercial and U.S. Government medical plans are subject to minimum medical loss ratio (\"MLR\") requirements. The MLR represents the percentage of premiums used to pay  14 14 14   claims and expenses for activities that improve the quality of care. If we do not satisfy the prescribed MLR, statutes require premium refunds to policyholders or to CMS.  See the \"Business - Regulation\" section of this Form 10-K for additional information about premiums, MLR requirements, Star Ratings and risk adjustment programs of the ACA.

Fueled by advanced insights and predictive analytics, Cigna Healthcare continues to develop innovative solutions that span the health care delivery system and can be applied to a multitude of providers. \u2022Accountable Care Program. We have approximately 239 collaborative care arrangements with primary care groups built on the patient-centered medical home and accountable care organization (\"ACO\") models. Program flexibility allowed adjustments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic designed to maintain appropriate focus on high-risk individuals and populations with chronic conditions impacted by Social Determinants of Health. As we emerge from the pandemic, we are leveraging new models to increase provider adoption of upside and downside risk sharing to drive better health outcomes and lower the total cost of care. \u2022Hospital Quality Program. We have contracts with approximately 152 hospital systems, involving over 592 hospitals, with reimbursements tied to quality metrics. \u2022Site of Care Redirection. We encourage the use of clinically appropriate settings to reduce the cost of care. This results in significant cost savings compared to receiving the same care in a hospital setting, while ensuring high quality care and service. \u2022Specialist Programs. We have approximately 266 arrangements with specialist groups in value-based reimbursement arrangements across six different disciplines. Arrangements include incentives for enhanced care coordination and episodes of care reimbursements for meeting cost and quality goals. We have expanded these programs to include prospective bundled payment arrangements beginning with orthopedics. \u2022Independent Practice Associations.

Key Transactions and Business Developments See the \"Executive Overview - Key Transactions and Business Developments\" section of our MD&A located in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for discussion of key developments impacting this segment.  16 16 16    OTHER OPERATIONS Other Operations comprises the remainder of our business operations, which includes certain ongoing businesses and exiting businesses. Our ongoing businesses include our continuing business, COLI, as described below, as well as our run-off businesses. Our run-off businesses include (i) GMDB and GMIB business that were effectively exited through reinsurance with Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\"Berkshire\") in 2013, (ii) settlement annuity business, and (iii) individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses comprised of deferred gains from the sales of these businesses. Our exiting businesses include our interest in a joint venture in T\u00fcrkiye, which was sold to our partner in December 2022, the international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses sold on July 1, 2022, and the Group Disability and Life business sold on December 31, 2020.  In 2022, Other Operations reported adjusted revenues of $2.3 billion and pre-tax adjusted income from operations of $500 million. Other Operations was previously named Group Disability and Other. Ongoing Businesses Continuing Business Corporate-Owned Life Insurance The principal products of the COLI business are permanent insurance contracts sold to corporations to provide coverage on the lives of certain employees for financing employer-paid future benefit obligations. Permanent life insurance provides coverage that, when adequately funded, does not expire after a term of years. The contracts are primarily non-participating universal life policies. Fees for universal life insurance products consist primarily of mortality and administrative charges assessed against the policyholder's fund balance. Interest credited and mortality charges for universal life and mortality charges on variable universal life may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected interest and mortality experience. To reduce our exposure to large individual losses, we purchase reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurers. Run-off Businesses Settlement Annuity Business Our settlement annuity business is a closed, run-off block of single premium annuity contracts. These contracts are primarily liability settlements with approximately 15% of the liabilities associated with guaranteed payments not contingent on survivorship. Non-guaranteed payments are contingent on the survival of one or more parties involved in the settlement. Reinsurance Our reinsurance operations are an inactive business in run-off. In February 2013, we effectively exited the GMDB and GMIB business by reinsuring 100% of our future exposures, net of retrocessional arrangements in place at that time, up to a specified limit. For additional information regarding this reinsurance transaction and the arrangements that secure our reinsurance recoverables, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Individual Life Insurance and Annuity and Retirement Benefits Businesses This business includes deferred gains recognized from the 1998 sale of the individual life insurance and annuity business and the 2004 sale of the retirement benefits business. For more information regarding the arrangements that secure our reinsurance recoverables for the retirement benefits business, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  17 17 17   Exiting Businesses  Our Interest in a Joint Venture in T\u00fcrkiye In December 2022, we divested our ownership interest in Cigna Sa\u011fl\u0131k Hayat ve Emeklilik, our joint venture in T\u00fcrkiye, to our long-time partner QNB Finansbank.

South Korea represented our single largest geographic market for these businesses.  Group Disability and Life Our Group Disability and Life operating segment included our commercial long-term and short-term disability products and our term life group insurance products, until completion of the sale in 2020. We also offered personal accident insurance and will continue to offer voluntary products and services that were not part of the sale. Beginning in 2021, voluntary products and services are reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment.   INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT Our investment operations provide investment management and related services for our various businesses, including the insurance-related invested assets in our General Account (\"General Account Invested Assets\"). We acquire or originate, directly or through intermediaries, a broad range of investments, including private placement and public securities, commercial mortgage loans, real estate, mezzanine, private equity partnerships and short-term investments. Invested assets also include policy loans that are fully collateralized by insurance policy cash values. We also enter into derivative financial instruments, primarily to minimize the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our investments and to manage the interest rate exposures of our long-term debt. Invested assets are managed primarily by our subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, external managers with whom our subsidiaries contract. Net investment income is included as a component of adjusted income from operations for each of our segments and Corporate. Realized investment gains (losses) are reported by segment but excluded from adjusted income from operations. For additional information about invested assets, see the \"Investment Assets\" section of the MD&A and Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We manage our investment portfolios to reflect the underlying characteristics of related insurance and contractholder liabilities and capital requirements, as well as regulatory and tax considerations pertaining to those liabilities and state investment laws. Insurance and contractholder liabilities range from short duration health care products to longer-term obligations associated with life insurance products and the run-off settlement annuity business. Assets supporting these liabilities are managed in segregated investment portfolios to facilitate matching of asset durations and cash flows to those of corresponding liabilities. Investment results are affected by the amount and timing of cash available for investment, economic and market conditions and asset allocation decisions. We routinely monitor and evaluate the status of our investments, obtaining and analyzing relevant investment-specific information and assessing current economic conditions, trends in capital markets and other factors such as industry sector, geographic and property-specific information. Separate Accounts Our subsidiaries or external advisors manage invested assets of separate accounts on behalf of contractholders, including The Cigna Group Pension Plan, variable universal life products sold through our corporate-owned life insurance business and other life insurance products. These assets are legally segregated from our other businesses and are not included in General Account Invested Assets. Income, gains and losses generally accrue directly to the contractholders.   STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS Cigna Ventures. In addition to the portfolio investments in our general and separate accounts discussed in the Investment Management section above that support our insurance operations, we make targeted investments within the health care industry, specifically. In 2022, The Cigna Group committed an additional $450 million to Cigna Ventures, our strategic corporate venture fund, resulting in an aggregate commitment of $700 million to this strategic initiative. Cigna Ventures invests in promising startups and growth-stage companies who, like us, are unlocking new growth possibilities in health care. Specifically, we invest in companies  18 18 18   making groundbreaking progress in three strategic areas: insights and analytics, digital health and experience, and care delivery and enablement. As of December\u00a031, 2022, Cigna Ventures has seven venture capital partners and 22 existing direct investments. Through these deep partnerships we collaborate, innovate and develop new solutions that address critical challenges of health and vitality impacting the people we serve.   VillageMD. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a commitment to become a minority owner in VillageMD by investing up to $2.7 billion in VillageMD preferred equity. In January 2023, we invested $2.5 billion of the $2.7 billion. VillageMD is an independent primary care group committed to offering high-quality, accessible primary care options for communities across the country through Village Medical. VillageMD partners with physicians to provide the tools, technology, operations, staffing support and industry relationships to deliver high-quality clinical care and better patient outcomes, while reducing the total cost of care. VillageMD and Village Medical operate in 22 markets and are responsible for more than 1.6 million patients.     DIGITAL, DATA AND TECHNOLOGY The Cigna Group's investments in digital, data and technology are focused on cultivating robust digital-first capabilities to better engage with customers and stakeholders. We deliver value for our clients, customers and other stakeholders by creating better health outcomes, improving customer experience and lowering total cost of care.  Innovation. Customer-centric, digital-first innovation remains at the forefront of our priorities. The advancement of our internal capabilities and strategic partnerships continues to produce new and more effective ways to engage with our customers to help close gaps in care, optimize treatment and improve outcomes. During 2022, technology continued to deliver value for current business while simultaneously focusing on reducing complexity and cost within our technology ecosystem. In the future, with a simplified technology ecosystem, we expect an increase in optionality, customer engagement, loyalty and speed to market. (See Evernorth Intelligence Solutions section of the \"Business - Evernorth Health Services\" discussion of this Form 10-K for additional information on our intelligent solutions and capabilities).  In 2022, The Cigna Group continued to invest in our technology capabilities to produce new and more effective ways to operate, as well as meet customers where they are. We intend to lead with digital engagement by creating connections between points of care and guiding customers through the best mechanism to the optimal location and provider. Our modernized data and technology ecosystem will empower us to integrate our assets, gather insights and engage with prospects and customers in new ways. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, our capital expenditures for property, equipment and computer software were $1.3 billion.   Data and Analytics. Our rich, integrated data allows us to provide differentiated outcomes. We conduct timely, rigorous and objective research and analysis that informs evidence-based medical and pharmacy benefit management and evaluates the clinical, economic and individual impact of enhanced benefit designs and programs. The combination of our predictive analytics, as well as our machine and deep learning capabilities create actionable intelligence that informs decision-making of our health care professionals. Our data-driven approach to behavioral health provides personalized and customized care across the entire continuum for the populations we serve. These solutions predict emerging health needs, close gaps in care and drive cost savings - all while empowering whole-person and whole-family health.  During 2022, we continued to leverage both internal and external data to identify and address health disparities and better understand the long-term medical and behavioral complications facing our customers. The data-informed approach allows for delivery of solutions with a digital-first entry point that meet our customers where they are to offer physical and behavioral health support.  Digital. Our digital health focus has shown value across the enterprise by creating engaging experiences that give customers the right information at the right time. We continue to bring new technology-enabled products and services to the market, expanding on a platform that connects to a given benefit structure in a single personalized environment. This allows for further capitalization on our unique data. Cybersecurity protections continue to be a top priority across The Cigna Group's digital offerings.  Technology Operations. Our technology team, powered by over 8,500 employees and several thousand external resources working with our partners, supports the various information systems essential to our operations, including the health benefit claims processing systems and specialty and home delivery pharmacy systems. Uninterrupted point-of-sale electronic retail pharmacy claims processing is a significant operational requirement for our business. We believe we have substantial capacity for growth in our United States pharmacy claims processing facilities. Our pharmacy technology platform allows us to safely, rapidly and accurately adjudicate over one billion adjusted prescriptions annually. Our technology helps retail pharmacies focus on patient care and our real-time safety checks help avoid medication errors. The Cigna Group companies hold over 320 United States patents. We use these patents to protect our proprietary technological advances and to differentiate ourselves in the market.  19 19 19    HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Cigna Group's mission is to improve the health and vitality of those we serve. A global healthy and diverse workforce is essential to achieving our mission and our business growth strategies. We are continually investing in our global workforce to support our employees' health and well-being, further drive diversity and inclusion, provide fair and market-competitive pay and foster employee growth and development. As of the end of 2022, we had approximately 71,300 employees, with 94% of our employees based in the United States. Approximately 97% of our employees are full-time.  Health, Well-Being and Other Benefits Tending to our employees' health and vitality is a critical business imperative for our company and one of the most important investments in our enterprise that we make each year. We believe that when we support our employees' health and well-being, they have fewer absences and are more productive and engaged in driving our mission and business strategy forward, thereby creating shareholder value. In 2022, The Cigna Group invested approximately 18% of total payroll in health, well-being and other benefits, including life and disability programs, 401(k) contributions and retirement-related benefits for our employees in the United States.  In addition to traditional medical and pharmacy benefits, we provide both physical and mental health support to employees, including: nutrition and fitness programs, employee assistance program (EAP) benefits that are free to all employees and to all members of their household, and digital tools that provide access to education and therapy to help individuals build greater resilience and cope with stress, anxiety and depression. Diversity, Equity & Inclusion At The Cigna Group, we take an expansive view of diversity including race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity. As of the end of 2022, based on employee self-reporting, 71% of our employees were women, and 39% of our employees in the United States were ethnic minorities (which includes Black / African American, Asian, Hispanic or Latinx, Pacific Islander and American Indian / Alaskan employees).  We are committed to attracting and recruiting key diverse talent into various leadership development programs and other entry level positions across the business. This success is rooted in strategic relationships with diverse student groups at our partner colleges and universities, as well as our commitment to multiple national, regional and local organizations, which provide us focused recruiting opportunities with women, the LGBTQ+ community, military veterans and underrepresented minority groups.  Our compensation practices, rooted in our pay-for-performance philosophy, promote equity in pay through measures such as benchmarking compensation by role, eliminating inquiries regarding applicants' compensation history from the hiring process and monitoring for potential disparities. Our most recent pay equity analysis among our U.S. employees, conducted in 2023, illustrated that female employees of The Cigna Group earn more than 99 cents for every dollar earned by similarly-situated male employees, and employees from underrepresented groups (which includes Black/African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaskan employees) earn more than 99 cents for every dollar earned by similarly-situated white employees. This year, for the first time, we also analyzed gender pay on a global basis and found that across the entire Company female employees at The Cigna Group earn more than 99 cents for every dollar earned by similarly-situated male employees. Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention Our talent acquisition and rewards strategies are designed to attract and retain skilled employees who are engaged in our mission. Our compensation program is rooted in market competitive base salaries and incentives that reward contributions that advance the Company's strategy and mission. Shifts in labor dynamics that started in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic have continued to impact our employee population. As we have adapted to new ways of working post-pandemic, where possible, employees work with their leaders to determine whether they work onsite, work at home, or leverage a hybrid option. The level of worker attrition continues to be above our pre-pandemic levels as well: in 2022, the voluntary turnover rate was 16% for all employees. In previous 10-K filings, we reported the voluntary turnover rate only for exempt employees in the United States.  Our online learning platform and career development tools and events offer a broad range of training, education and development resources to all employees. In 2022, based on internal data, U.S. employees on average engaged in 34 hours of learning through these resources. Enterprise leadership development programs were provided to executive, high-potential and new manager audiences to develop and expand leadership capability across the enterprise. The Cigna Group also offers an education reimbursement program for both full and part-time employees who meet the continuing education criteria. We believe these strategies and programs contribute to employee engagement and retention.   20 20 20    ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE The Cigna Group's environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") framework is structured around four pillars that underscore our mission to improve the health and vitality of those we serve. We drive action through this framework to deliver on our ESG vision: to transform the ecosystem of health into one that is well-functioning, sustainable, accessible and equitable - advancing better health for all. Our commitment to this vision guides us in our multidimensional value-creation strategy as we strive to meet the needs of our many stakeholders. The four pillars of our ESG framework are:  Healthy Environment  We believe that responsible environmental stewardship can improve health and well-being and also makes sound business sense. We strive to identify new efficiencies and make strategic investments to drive progress on our operational sustainability targets. We aim to reduce our environmental impacts and our operating costs, but our commitments are not material to our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.   Healthy Society  We work to advance better health for all. Building a well-functioning, sustainable, accessible and equitable health care system involves understanding and addressing social determinants of health, advancing health equity and improving medical quality and access while prioritizing affordability, lowering health risks, promoting preventive health interventions and coordinating all aspects of care. We drive progress in each of these areas by aligning our products and services with value-based care models, leveraging integrated benefits, managing drug costs through innovation, expanding digital offerings, and reviewing coverage policies for health equity. We also help to eliminate barriers to care and address other factors that contribute to health disparities.  Healthy Workforce  We believe that employers play a vital role in the health care system, and we strive to be a model for others by prioritizing the health and well-being of employees within our own company. We are advancing our diversity, equity and inclusion commitments, including by setting aspirational goals to increase gender equality in our leadership pipeline. We are continuing to evolve our employee programs to meet the dynamic working environment and supporting our employees in their career growth as they support the growth of our business. See further discussion of this pillar within Part I, Item 1 \"Human Capital Management\" section above.   Healthy Company  We strive to promote positive societal impact, ethical behavior and responsible and resilient business practices across our multidimensional enterprise. This includes adhering to strong board governance practices, protecting the sensitive data of our clients and customers by ensuring cybersecurity incident response preparedness, as well as supporting a responsible supply chain and committing to increasing our annual diverse supplier spend.   MISCELLANEOUS \u2022Revenues from U.S. Federal Government agencies, under a number of contracts, represented 14% of our consolidated revenues in 2022 and 2021 and 15% in 2020.  \u2022The Company does not rely on business from one or a few brokers or agents.    REGULATION The laws and regulations governing our business continue to increase each year and are subject to frequent change. We are regulated by federal, state and international legislative bodies and agencies, which generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. These regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals, which could materially impact the health care system. We expect continued legislative and regulatory debate of issues related to our businesses. As has become increasingly common with public policy reforms in the health services industry, executive, judicial or legislative intervention could alter, slow or eliminate the impact of any proposal following the related regulation's promulgation. 21 21 21   Many aspects of our business are directly regulated by federal and state laws and administrative agencies, such as HHS, CMS, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), the U.S. Departments of Labor (\"DOL\") and Treasury, the Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\"), the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"), the SEC, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (\"ONC\"), state departments of insurance and state boards of pharmacy. Our business practices may also be shaped by enforcement actions of federal agencies, such as the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), state agencies, as well as judicial decisions. In addition, aspects of our business are subject to indirect regulation. The self-funded benefit plans sponsored by our U.S. employer clients are regulated under federal law. These self-funded clients expect us to ensure that our administration of their plans complies with the regulatory requirements applicable to them. Our business operations and the books and records of our regulated businesses are routinely subject to examination and audit at regular intervals by state insurance and HMO regulatory agencies, state boards of pharmacy, CMS, DOL, IRS, OPM and comparable international regulators to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our operations are also subject to non-routine examinations, audits and investigations by various state and federal regulatory agencies, generally as the result of a complaint. In addition, we may be implicated in investigations of our clients whose group benefit plans we administer on their behalf. As a result, we routinely receive subpoenas and other demands or requests for information from various state insurance and HMO regulatory agencies, state attorneys general, the HHS Office of Inspector General (\"HHS-OIG\"), the DOJ, the DOL and other state, federal and international authorities. We may also be called upon by members of the U.S. Congress to provide information, including testifying before Congressional committees and subcommittees, regarding certain of our business practices. If The Cigna Group is determined to have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, these examinations, audits, investigations, reviews, subpoenas and demands may: \u2022result in fines, penalties, injunctions, consent orders or loss of licensure; \u2022suspend or exclude us from participation in government programs or limit our ability to sell or market our products; \u2022require changes in business practices; \u2022damage relationships with the agencies that regulate us and affect our ability to secure regulatory approvals necessary for the operation of our business; or \u2022damage our brand and reputation. Our international subsidiaries are subject to regulations in international jurisdictions, including in certain cases many regulations similar to the federal and state regulations described below, which are complex and where foreign insurers may face more rigorous regulations than their domestic competitors and may also be affected by geopolitical developments or tensions. The laws and regulations governing our business, as well as the related interpretations, are subject to frequent change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other. Changes in our business environment are likely to continue as elected and appointed officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to existing laws and regulations. Even where we believe that we are in compliance with the various laws and regulations, any enforcement actions by federal, state or international government officials alleging non-compliance with these rules and regulations could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business. For a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with these laws and regulations see the Risk Factors section located in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Management continues to be actively engaged with regulators and policymakers with respect to legislation and rulemaking. COVID-19-related Regulatory Actions In response to COVID-19 and its variants, U.S. federal and state governments have increasingly enacted new legislative and regulatory requirements, as well as provided flexibility to industry participants within existing legal requirements. These regulatory actions primarily provide for: \u2022mandating or requesting waiver of customer cost-sharing and other related costs such as COVID-19 testing or treatment, as well as establishing provider reimbursement and vaccine immunizations coverage requirements; \u2022extending claims filing deadlines for providers, customers and facilities; \u2022mandating or encouraging waiver of customer cost-share related to telemedicine services, as well as requiring certain reimbursement levels for telemedicine providers to encourage its utilization; \u2022increasing the Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement for certain items and services; \u2022enacting coverage and reimbursement requirements at in-network levels for certain services received from out-of-network providers; \u2022clarification regarding permissible sharing of information and coordination among health care providers; and  22 22 22   \u2022requiring vaccinations for certain employee populations. These actions are in effect for various durations, but generally track the different states of emergency that have been declared at the state and federal levels. Of particular significance is the Public Health Emergency (\"PHE\") declared by the Secretary of HHS on January 31, 2020, which has since been extended and sets the effective period for certain of the requirements established through federal COVID-19 legislation, such as covering testing without cost sharing. On January 30, 2023, the Biden administration announced that it plans to end the PHE and Federal National Emergency on May 11, 2023. With the PHE coming to an end, states will be required to resume Medicaid redeterminations for the first time since the PHE began. These redeterminations will take place on a staggered basis, but it is anticipated that the remediations will find many beneficiaries are no longer eligible for Medicaid. As a result, it is expected that beneficiaries determined to be ineligible for Medicaid may seek alternate coverage in the individual marketplace.  Patient Protection and the Affordable Care Act The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") mandated broad changes to the U.S. health care system that affect insured and self-insured health benefit plans and pharmacy benefit managers. Our business model is impacted by the ACA, including our relationships with current and future producers and health care providers, products, service providers and technologies. The provisions of the ACA imposed, among other things, certain assessments on health insurers, created health insurance exchanges for individuals and small group employers to purchase insurance coverage and implemented minimum MLRs for our Medicare and commercial businesses. Certain states have adopted MLR requirements applicable to our commercial businesses that are more stringent than those established by the ACA. Other provisions of the ACA in effect include reduced Medicare Advantage payment rates, the requirement to cover preventive services with no enrollee cost-sharing, banning the use of lifetime and annual limits on the dollar amount of essential health benefits, increasing restrictions on rescinding coverage, extending coverage of dependents up to age 26, restrictions on differential pricing, enforcement mechanisms and rules related to health care fraud and abuse enforcement activities and certain pharmacy benefit transparency requirements. The employer mandate requires employers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer affordable health insurance that provides minimum value (each as defined under the ACA) to full-time employees and their dependents, including children up to age 26, or be subject to penalties based on employer size. The ACA also changed certain tax laws to effectively limit tax deductions for certain employee compensation paid by health insurers. In December 2019, the federal government repealed the non-deductible health insurance industry fee effective for 2021, as well as the enacted but never implemented 40% excise tax on certain employer-sponsored coverage (known as the \"Cadillac Tax\") and the medical device tax. In 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government temporarily expanded eligibility for ACA subsidies to higher-income people who did not otherwise qualify, increased ACA subsidies for lower-income people who already qualify for 2021 and 2022, provided subsidies for individuals who receive unemployment benefits in 2021 and prevented taxpayers who misestimated their income in 2020 from having to repay excess premium tax credits. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August 2022, extended the expanded and increased premium tax credits for individuals enrolled in ACA qualified health plans, through December 31, 2025.  Medicare and Medicaid Regulations Through our subsidiaries, we offer individual and group Medicare Advantage, Medicare Prescription Drug (\"Part D\") and Medicare Supplement products. We also provide Medicare Part D-related products and services to other Medicare Part D sponsors, Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans and employers and clients offering Medicare Part D benefits to Medicare Part D eligible beneficiaries, including those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid benefits (\"dual-eligible\"). As part of our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D business, we contract with CMS to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. We offer dual-eligible products and participate in state Medicaid programs directly or indirectly through our clients who are Medicaid managed care contractors. We also perform certain Medicaid subrogation services and certain delegated services for clients, including utilization management, which are regulated by federal and state laws. Our dual-eligible products are regulated by CMS and state Medicaid agencies audit our performance to determine compliance with contracts and regulations. Our ability to obtain payment (and the determination of the amount of such payments), market to, enroll and retain customers and expand into new service areas is subject to compliance with CMS' numerous and complex regulations and requirements that are frequently modified and subject to administrative discretion, review and enforcement.  CMS evaluates Medicare Advantage plans and Part D plans under its \"Star Rating\" system. The Star Rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, for example, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, coverage determinations and appeals and customer satisfaction. A plan's Star Rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform very well are able to offer enhanced benefits and market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans. Medicare Advantage plans' quality-bonus payments are determined by the Star Rating, with plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for such payments. The Star Rating system is subject to change annually by CMS, which may make it more difficult to achieve and maintain four stars or greater. For example, beginning with Star Ratings for payment year 2024, CMS will place more emphasis on patient experience survey-based measures which could reduce Star Ratings predictability year over year. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on 2020 care patterns and utilization, CMS finalized rules applying relief to Medicare Advantage  23 23 23   and Part D Plan Star Ratings for payment year 2023 by utilizing the higher of the payment year 2023 or 2022 measure level Star Ratings. The 2023 Star Ratings will only include adjustments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact for three Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures, and we expect this change will result in a decrease in our Star Ratings for payment year 2024.  CMS provides risk-adjusted premium payments for Medicare Advantage plans based on our customer demographics and medical diagnoses, which may change from period to period based on the underlying health of our customers. Under this model, rates paid to Medicare Advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard Medicare-covered benefits to an enrollee with a \"national average risk profile.\" That baseline payment amount is adjusted to reflect the health status of our enrolled membership. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, Medicare Advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician providers to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We generally rely on providers to appropriately document their claims and other submissions with appropriate diagnoses from which we extract hierarchical condition codes to submit to CMS as the basis for our payments received under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses the diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to the plans. These adjustments are generally settled semi-annually with CMS. The final adjustment is generally settled with CMS in the year following the contract year. CMS may conduct audits to validate risk-adjustment data submitted by health plans.  On January 30, 2023, CMS issued the Final Rule titled \"Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit, Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), Medicaid Fee-For-Service, and Medicaid Managed Care Programs for Years 2020 and 2021\", effective April 3, 2023. The Final Rule addresses CMS's audit methodology and related policies for the Risk Adjustment Data Validation (\"RADV\"). Although CMS did not specify their sampling or extrapolation methodology the rule did codify that CMS will use a statistically valid method for sampling and extrapolation of error rates and the decision not to apply a fee for service adjuster when determining RADV audit findings. CMS will not apply extrapolation to RADV audits until the 2018 payment year with payment recoveries for those RADV audits expected in 2025. Audits for payment years prior to 2018 are not subject to extrapolation. RADV audits for our contract years 2011 through 2015 are currently in process. The Company is not currently subject to RADV audits for the 2018 and subsequent payment years. Coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare Part D is also regulated by CMS and our contracts with CMS contain provisions for risk sharing and certain payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk. These provisions affect our ultimate payments from CMS. For example, premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor payments that compare costs targeted in our annual bids with actual prescription costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the payments we received. We expect CMS, HHS-OIG, DOJ and other federal agencies to continue to closely scrutinize each component of the Medicare Advantage program and modify the terms and requirements of the program through rulemaking or enforcement activities. The Company continues to believe that further regulation or changes to existing regulations could result in disruption in the marketplace including the potential for some combination of degraded plan benefits and higher monthly premiums. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant consequences, including fines and penalties, enrollment sanctions, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, limitations on expansion and criminal penalties.  False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Laws Our products and services are also subject to the federal False Claims Act (the \"False Claims Act\"), state false claims acts and federal and state anti-kickback laws. Additionally, the federal government has made investigating and prosecuting health care fraud, waste and abuse a priority. Fraud, waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks in return for customer referrals, billing for unnecessary medical services, upcoding and improper marketing. The regulations and contractual requirements in this area are complex, frequently modified and subject to administrative discretion and judicial interpretation. False Claims Act and Related Criminal Provisions. The False Claims Act imposes civil penalties on any person who knowingly, as defined by the statute, makes, conspires to make, or causes to be made false claims, records, or statements, or fails to return known overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Private individuals may bring qui tam or \"whistleblower\" suits under the False Claims Act, which authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit. The ACA amended the federal anti-kickback laws to state any claim submitted to a federal or state health care program that violates the anti-kickback laws is also a false claim under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act generally provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages, creating the possibility of substantial financial liabilities. Criminal statutes similar to the False Claims Act provide that if a corporation is convicted of presenting a claim or making a statement it knows to be false, fictitious or fraudulent to any federal agency, the corporation may be fined. Conviction under these  24 24 24   statutes may also result in exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs. Many states have also enacted laws similar to the False Claims Act, some of which may include criminal penalties, substantial fines and treble damages. Anti-Kickback and Referral Laws. Subject to certain exceptions and \"safe harbors,\" the federal anti-kickback statute generally prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully paying, receiving or offering any payment or other remuneration to induce a person to purchase, lease, order or arrange for items (including prescription drugs) or services reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or another federal health care program. Many states have similar laws, some of which are not limited to items or services paid for with government funds. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-kickback laws may include criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs.  Anti-kickback laws have been cited as a partial basis, along with state consumer protection laws described below, for investigations and multi-state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies or payors in connection with \"product conversion\" or promotion programs. Other anti-kickback and referral laws may also be applicable including criminal and civil laws restricting illegal kickbacks and conflicts of interest in connection with plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"), the federal \"Stark Law,\" and various state anti-kickback restrictions.  In November 2020, HHS and HHS-OIG released a final rule that eliminates an anti-kickback regulatory safe harbor protection for price concessions, including rebates, that are offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors or pharmacy benefit managers under the Medicare Part D program. The final rule creates two new safe harbors: (i) for price reductions by manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D and Medicaid managed care organizations that are reflected at the time of dispense and (ii) for fixed-fee service arrangements between manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers. The effective date of the final rule has been postponed to 2032. Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The federal civil monetary penalty statute provides for civil monetary penalties against any person who gives something of value to a Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular provider for Medicare or Medicaid items or services. Under this law, our wholly-owned home delivery pharmacies, specialty pharmacies and home health providers are restricted from offering certain items of value to influence a Medicare or Medicaid patient's use of services. The ACA also includes several civil monetary provisions, such as penalties for the failure to report and return a known overpayment and failure to grant timely access to the HHS-OIG under certain circumstances. Federal and State Oversight of Government-Sponsored Health Care Programs Participation in government-sponsored health care programs subjects us to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations and risks associated with audits conducted under these programs. These audits may occur years after the provision of services. Risks include potential fines and penalties, restrictions on our ability to participate or expand our presence in certain programs and restrictions on marketing our plans. For example, with respect to our Medicare Advantage business, CMS and the HHS-OIG perform audits to determine a health plan's compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations, including program audits and RADV audits, which focus on compliance with proper coding practices. Certain of our contracts are currently subject to audits by CMS and the HHS-OIG, including RADV audits. CMS has announced that its goal is to subject all Medicare Advantage contracts to either a comprehensive or a targeted RADV audit for each contract year. The DOJ is also currently conducting industry-wide investigations of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes of The Cigna Group and a number of other Medicare Advantage organizations. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. For our Medicare Part D business, compliance with certain contractual provisions and regulatory requirements is subject to review by Recovery Audit Contractor audits in which third-party contractors conduct post-payment reviews on a contingency fee basis to detect and correct improper payments. Government Procurement Regulations We have a contract with the U.S. DoD, which subjects us to applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR\") and the DoD FAR Supplement, which govern federal government contracts. Further, there are other federal and state laws applicable to our DoD arrangement and our arrangements with other clients that may be subject to government procurement regulations. In addition, certain of our clients participate as contracting carriers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program administered by the OPM, which includes various pharmacy benefit management standards. Employee Retirement Income Security Act Our domestic subsidiaries sell most of their products and services to sponsors of employee benefit plans that are governed by ERISA. ERISA is a complex set of federal laws and regulations enforced by the IRS and the DOL, as well as the courts. ERISA regulates certain aspects of the relationship between us, the employers that maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA and the  25 25 25   participants in such plans. Certain of our domestic subsidiaries are also subject to requirements imposed by ERISA affecting claim payment and appeals procedures for individual health insurance and insured and self-insured group health plans and for the insured plans we administer. Certain of our domestic subsidiaries also may contractually agree to comply with these requirements on behalf of the self-insured plans they administer. We believe the conduct of our pharmacy benefit management business is not generally subject to the fiduciary obligations of ERISA. However, there can be no assurances that the DOL may not assert that pharmacy benefit managers are fiduciaries. From time to time, states have considered, and in limited cases, enacted legislation to declare a pharmacy benefit manager or health benefit manager a fiduciary with respect to its clients. Plans subject to ERISA may also be subject to state laws and the legal question of whether and to what extent ERISA preempts a state law is likely to continue to be a subject for interpretation by the courts for years to come. Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulations Numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations govern the creation, collection, dissemination, receipt, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, processing, and disposal (collectively \"Processing\") of protected health information (\"PHI\") and other personally identifiable information (\"PII\"). Many of our activities involve Processing of PHI and PII. In addition, we use aggregated and de-identified data for our own research and analysis purposes and, in some cases, provide access to such de-identified data, or analytics created from such data, to third parties. We may also use such information to create analytic models designed to predict, and potentially improve, outcomes and patient care. We are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that Process credit card information maintain a secure environment. On the federal level we are subject to a number of sector specific regulation. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, Public Law 116-321, and the regulations that implement these laws (collectively \"HIPAA\") impose requirements on covered entities and business associates that address the privacy and security of PHI. In the conduct of our business we may be either a covered entity or business associate, and we may also be held liable under HIPAA for violations by our vendors that are business associates. HIPAA imposes contracting requirements, requires breach notifications, and establishes rules that standardize the format and content of certain electronic transactions, including eligibility and claims. Violations of HIPAA may result in enforcement actions, civil and criminal penalties and settlement, resolution, and monitoring agreements. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents and may negotiate settlements for related cases on behalf of their respective residents. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation, audit or compliance review regarding our compliance with HIPAA. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action, its standards have been used as a basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in the handling, misuse or breach of PHI. HIPAA does not preempt more stringent state health privacy laws and regulations, which may protect the health information of certain individuals, such as minors, and certain types of sensitive health information, such as transgender care, HIV/AIDS status, reproductive health information, genetic information, and mental and behavioral health. The federal government has also enacted final regulations on interoperability and information blocking to support the seamless and secure access, exchange and use of electronic health information by and between patients, enrollees and entities such as payors and health care providers. These regulations apply to a variety of entities , including health plans, and generally require significant enhancements to information technology and data governance practices. The regulations impact how industry participants, including us, comply with disclosure requirements and share information with individuals and other health care organizations.  The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLBA\") and its implementing regulations generally place restrictions on the disclosure of nonpublic information to nonaffiliated third parties, and requires financial institutions, including insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal information is used, including an opportunity to \"opt out\" of certain disclosures. State departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law. In 2023, significant changes to GLBA's \"Safeguards Rule\" will go into effect, substantially raising the GLBA standards for security.  Additionally, under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (\"FTC Act\"), the FTC has jurisdiction over certain privacy and security practices deemed unfair and deceptive acts and practices in or affecting commerce. The FTC has charged companies with violating this act based on failures to appropriately and transparently safeguard personal information, respect consumers' privacy rights, based on disclosures of health and personal information to third parties, the failure to limit third-party use of health information, the failure to implement policies and procedures to prevent the improper or unauthorized disclosure of health information, and the failure to provide notice and obtain consent before the use and disclosure of health information for advertising. In addition to the FTC Act, the FTC also enforces other federal laws relating to consumers' privacy and security. The FTC has also been active with respect to companies' use of big data and artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), specifically ensuring fair and equitable use of these tools, and the FTC has named AI as an area of enforcement focus. State legislatures and regulators are similarly interested in the use of AI, particularly as it is used in modeling, and a handful of states have either passed legislation or issued regulatory guidance concerning AI. Additionally,  26 26 26   the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"), an organization of state insurance regulators, recently established the Innovation, Cybersecurity and Technology Committee to provide a forum for regulators to learn, monitor and confer on emerging technology issues, including, among others, cybersecurity and AI. State Departments of Insurance (\"DOI\") and other state government agencies and legislatures are increasingly aware and active in providing guidance in the AI space.  The SEC has proposed additional cybersecurity disclosure obligations on reporting companies, with final rulemaking expected in 2023.   The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (\"CISA\") encouraged organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and, among other things, directed HHS to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry. States have also begun to issue regulations specifically related to cybersecurity, which may differ or conflict from state to state. In October 2017, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law that creates rules for insurers and other covered entities addressing data security, investigation and notification of breaches. This includes maintaining an information security program based on ongoing risk assessment, overseeing third-party service providers, investigating data breaches and notifying regulators of a cybersecurity event. As the model law is intended to serve as model legislation only, states will need to enact legislation for the model law to become mandatory and enforceable. To date, twenty-one states have enacted some form of the model law. Over the past several years, the federal government has increasingly focused on the cybersecurity requirements applicable to government contractors, including enhanced guidance and regulation. These include compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (\"DFARS\") cybersecurity requirements, the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (\"CMMC\") (going into effect over the next four years and based on NIST standards), the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (\"FISMA\"), and the White House's 2021 Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity. Some local authorities are increasing focused on protecting individuals from identity theft and a number of states have adopted comprehensive data security laws and regulations requiring, among other things, certain minimum data security standards and security breach notifications that may apply to us in certain circumstances, as well as certain limitations on access to and use of PII. These laws and regulations include state general data breach laws, which exist in all fifty states and protect PII generally, as well as DOI cybersecurity laws, applicable to various DOI licensees, such as insurers, PBMs and TPAs. Many states also have their own sector-specific laws regarding the Processing of PII which may apply to us as well. In the past few years, five states have adopted their own comprehensive consumer privacy statutes and many more states are considering doing so. Generally, the statutes exempt data and/or entities regulated by GLBA and/or HIPAA but are, in varying respects, applicable to other data we collect, such as PII provided by website visitors, and in California, employees and business partners. Additionally, we anticipate federal and state legislators and regulators will continue to enact legislation related to privacy and cybersecurity, including with respect to ransomware incidents.  In addition, international laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of PII can be more stringent than those in the United States, and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which became effective May 2018, enhanced or created obligations regarding the handling of PII relating to European residents (such as regarding notices, data protection impact assessments and individual rights) and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance than the previous European Directive or laws. In addition, many countries outside of Europe where we conduct business have implemented or may implement data protection laws and regulations, some of which include requirements modeled after those in the GDPR. Some non-U.S. jurisdictions are also instituting data residency regulations requiring that data be maintained within the respective jurisdiction or otherwise restricting transfer of personal data across borders unless specified regulatory requirements are met. See Part I. Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with privacy and security regulations. Consumer Protection Laws We engage in direct-to-consumer activities and are increasingly offering mobile and web-based solutions to our customers. We are therefore subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and other consumer protection laws and regulations, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the CAN-SPAM Act. With the ever increasing reliance and demand by consumers on using their mobile devices for convenient communications, we face increased risk under these laws. The FTC is also increasingly exercising its enforcement authority in the areas of consumer privacy and data security, with a focus on web-based, mobile data and \"big data.\" Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. State and federal policymakers have taken actions intended to increase transparency and predictability of health care costs for consumers. For example, the Transparency in Coverage rule issued in October 2020 by the HHS, the DOL and the Department of the Treasury now requires most group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to publicly disclose  27 27 27   price and cost-sharing information for all items and services to participants and enrollees. Health plans and health insurers must publicly disclose (i) in-network provider negotiated rates, and (ii) historical out-of-network allowed amounts and billed charges. The rule also required public disclosure of in-network negotiated rates and historical net prices for all covered prescription drugs, but the departments announced in August 2021 guidance that they will indefinitely defer enforcement of the rule's requirement that plans and issuers publish machine-readable files relating to prescription drug pricing pending further rulemaking. Beginning in 2023, we will be required to make available to members personalized cost-sharing information for 500 covered health care items and services. In 2024, this cost-sharing information requirement will expand to all items and services, including prescription drugs. Insurers offering group or individual health insurance coverage may receive credit in their MLR calculations for certain savings they share with enrollees that result from the enrollees shopping for, and receiving care from, lower-cost, higher-value providers.  Congress also passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (\"CAA\"), which included a number of transparency requirements on plans and issuers that are duplicative or overlap with the Transparency in Coverage rule issued by the departments. The indefinite enforcement deferral of the prescription drug pricing file under the Transparency in Coverage rule is, in part, due to the subsequent enactment of the CAA, which requires plans to report information regarding prescription drug spending to federal regulators beginning in 2022. The CAA also included the No Surprises Act, which prohibits health care providers, in certain situations, from balance billing the patient and requires that they work directly with insurers to agree on out-of-network reimbursement, including utilizing an independent dispute resolution (\"IDR\") process outlined in the act. Many states already have addressed balance billing, or surprise medical bills. These laws and regulations vary in their approach, resulting in different impacts on the health care system as a whole. In 2021, HHS, DOL and the Department of the Treasury, announced interim final rules (\"IFR\") intended to implement provisions of the No Surprises Act, certain provisions of which were vacated by a Federal district court in February and July 2022. The departments then issued a final rule on August 26, 2022, finalizing disclosure requirements relating to information that group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage must share about the Qualifying Payment Amount (\"QPA\"), which the departments have stated is generally based on the median contracted rate for a qualified IDR item or service, and requirements related to the consideration of information when a certified IDR entity makes a payment determination under the federal IDR process. The final rule was also challenged, and the final result is difficult to predict.  Additionally, most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations and multi-state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs. Such statutes have also been cited as the basis for claims or investigations by state attorneys general relative to privacy and data security. Office of Foreign Assets Control Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering We are also subject to regulation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals. Certain of our products are subject to the Department of the Treasury anti-money laundering regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act. In addition, we are subject to similar regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Other Laws Many states in which our subsidiaries operate limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals, and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians. Statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine, fee-splitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state. Under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and physician-owned professional groups, these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions, as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed health care providers, developing operating policies and procedures, implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance. We believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting and similar issues. However, any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business. Utilization Management Laws  State legislatures have begun to propose and enact laws exempting certain providers from pre-authorization requirements of insurers. These exemptions reduce the ability for insurers and medical management entities from reviewing services for medical necessity if the provider meets the law's established thresholds for approval rates in the preceding six months. The inability to apply pre-authorization requirements could lead to increased costs to plan issuers by way of the provision of unnecessary services. States are also standardizing the process for, and restricting the use of, utilization management rules and shortening the time frames within which prescription drug prior authorization determinations must be made. Even where states do not regulate pharmacy benefit or utilization management companies directly, these laws will apply to many of our clients, including managed care organizations and health insurers. 28 28 28   Laws and Legislation Affecting Pharmacy Benefit Plan Design, Administration and Pharmacy Network Access Some states have enacted laws that prohibit managed care plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive benefit plan design features, and many states have laws or have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans, including provisions relating to the pharmacy benefit. For example, some states, under so-called \"freedom of choice\" legislation, provide that customers of the plan may not be required to use network providers, but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use non-network providers. Some states have also enacted legislation that can negatively impact the use of cost-saving network configurations for plan sponsors, such as limiting the implementation of pharmacy benefit designs and reimbursement structures that leverage affiliate pharmacies to reduce costs. Other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans from offering customers financial incentives for use of home delivery pharmacies. Medicare and some states have issued guidance and regulations that limit our ability to fill or refill prescriptions electronically submitted by a physician to our home delivery pharmacy without first obtaining consent from the patient. Such restrictions generate additional costs and limit our ability to maximize efficiencies, which could otherwise be gained through the electronic prescription and automatic refill processes. Legislation has been introduced in some states to prohibit or restrict therapeutic intervention, or to require coverage of all Food and Drug Administration approved drugs. Other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions, and require health plan coverage of specific drugs if deemed medically necessary by the prescribing physician. Additionally, Medicare Part D and a majority of states now have laws, regulations or some form of legislation affecting our ability, or our clients' ability, to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove a provider from a network. Such laws, regulations or legislation may require us or our clients to admit any retail pharmacy or provider willing to meet the plan's terms and conditions for network participation (\"any willing provider\") or may direct that a provider may not be removed from a network except in compliance with certain procedures (\"due process\"). Certain states have laws prohibiting certain pharmacy benefit management clients from imposing additional copayments, deductibles, limitations on benefits, or other conditions on covered individuals utilizing a retail pharmacy when the same conditions are not otherwise imposed on covered individuals utilizing home delivery pharmacies. However, the laws require the retail pharmacy to agree to the same reimbursement amounts and terms and conditions as are imposed on the home delivery pharmacies. An increase in the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies may have a negative impact on the number of prescriptions filled through home delivery. Pharmacy Benefit Manager and Drug Pricing Regulation Our pharmacy benefit management services are subject to numerous laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, and proposed legislation and regulations may govern, critical practices, including: disclosure, receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers; certain pharmacy contracting practices including disclosure of cost information to customers; the receipt and retention of transmission fees from contracted pharmacies; performance-based price concessions; pharmacy price concessions to drug prices at the point of sale; audits of contracted pharmacies; use of, administration of, or changes to drug formularies, the use and disclosure of maximum allowable cost (\"MAC\") pricing, or clinical programs; \"most favored nation\" pricing, which provides that a pharmacy participating in a specific government program must give the program the best price the pharmacy makes available to any third-party plan; disclosure of data to third parties; drug utilization management practices; the level of duty a pharmacy benefit manager owes its clients or customers; configuration of pharmacy networks; the operations of our subsidiary pharmacies; referrals to affiliated pharmacies; disclosure of negotiated provider reimbursement rates; disclosure of negotiated drug rebates, calculation of certain customer cost-share for prescription drug claims; pricing that includes differential or spread (i.e., a difference between the drug price charged to the plan sponsor by a pharmacy benefit manager and the price paid by the manager to the dispensing provider); disclosure of fees associated with administrative service agreements and patient care programs that are attributable to customers' drug utilization; utilization management; and registration or licensing of pharmacy benefit managers.  We expect federal and state governments to continue to prioritize means of addressing out-of-pocket costs for consumers, particularly related to prescription drug costs. Recently enacted legislation, and other policy proposals and regulations vary broadly in their approaches to achieve that goal. For example, proposed legislation includes, among other things, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act; the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Accountability Study Act; a repeal of the 2020 Medicare drug rebate, as described above under the heading \"False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Laws\u2014Anti-Kickback and Referral Laws;\" and limits on manufacturer price increases for prescription drugs. Additionally, proposals at the federal and state levels consider increased regulation of pharmacy benefit managers and health plans as a means to limit consumer out-of-pocket costs, including: proposing to limit the use of various pharmacy benefit management tools; mandating the treatment of fees, discounts or financing mechanisms that otherwise are set in private contractual terms; increasing supply chain transparency; expanding regulatory requirements or definitions of fiduciaries; or  29 29 29   mandating plan benefit designs that cap consumer out-of-pocket expense. The NAIC has also proposed laws intended to protect consumer drug benefits and has examined regulatory approaches to pharmacy benefit manager business practices.  Some states have enacted statutes regulating the use of MAC pricing. These statutes, referred to as \"MAC Transparency Laws,\" generally require pharmacy benefit managers to disclose specific information related to MAC pricing to pharmacies and provide certain appeal rights for pharmacies. MAC Transparency Laws also restrict the application of MAC and may require operational changes to maintain compliance with the law. Some states have also enacted laws regulating pharmacy pricing and protecting the profitability of pharmacies for dispensing certain MAC-priced drugs. Some states have enacted laws requiring that the customer cost-share for a prescription drug claim not exceed certain price points, such as the pharmacy's usual and customary charge or its contracted reimbursement for the drug. In a recent Supreme Court decision, the Court found that certain MAC Transparency Laws may be applied by states to ERISA plans in addition to health plans regulated by the applicable state. Following this decision, state legislatures and regulators have sought to extend their oversight authority of self-funded ERISA plans to pharmacy benefit management functions and pharmacy benefit plan designs beyond MAC pricing.   The federal Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs reimbursed through state Medicaid programs, including through Medicaid managed care organizations. Manufacturers of brand-name products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of (a) 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (\"AMP\") paid by retail community pharmacies or by wholesalers for certain drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies, or (b) the difference between AMP and the \"best price\" available to essentially any customer other than the Medicaid program and certain other government programs, with certain exceptions. We negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers and, in certain circumstances, sell services to drug manufacturers. Investigations are being and have been conducted by certain government entities which call into question whether a drug's \"best price\" was properly calculated and reported with respect to rebates paid by the manufacturers to the Medicaid programs. We are not responsible for such calculations, reports or payments. In February 2022, the FTC began soliciting public comment on pharmacy benefit manager practices and their impact on patients, physicians, employers, independent and chain pharmacies, and other businesses in pharmaceutical distribution. In June 2022, the FTC announced an inquiry into pharmacy benefit managers and stated the FTC was seeking information concerning the competitive impact of the contracting and business practices of pharmacy benefit managers. The FTC required the six largest pharmacy benefit managers to provide information and records on topics including rebate contracts and ancillary agreements, documents related to strategies, conditions and plans for formulary placement, formulary exclusion, formulary tier assignment, and prior authorization regarding rebated drug products, and annual pharmacy reimbursement data for drugs on specialty drug lists and for rebated drug products. In July 2022, the FTC issued an enforcement policy statement indicating the FTC would scrutinize the impact of rebates and fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and other intermediaries to determine if laws such as the FTC Act, the Clayton Act, the Robinson-Patman Act and the Sherman Act may have been violated.  Pharmacy Regulation Our home delivery and specialty pharmacies also subject us to extensive federal, state and local regulation. The practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy, though our pharmacies are subject to laws described above under the headings \"Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulations\" and \"Consumer Protection Laws.\" We are licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the states in which our pharmacies are located and the health care professionals that we employ are also licensed by, and subject to, the laws and regulations of state boards of pharmacy and other governmental authorities. Most of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws that require out-of-state home delivery pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the board of pharmacy or a similar regulatory body in the state. These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state where the pharmacy is located, although some states require compliance with certain laws in that state as it impacts or relates to drugs distributed or dispensed into that state.  Our various pharmacy facilities also provide services under certain Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Participation in these programs requires our pharmacies to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations, and exposes the pharmacies to various changes the federal and state governments may impose regarding reimbursement methodologies, the submission of claims and amounts to be paid to participating providers under these programs. In addition, several of our pharmacy facilities are participating providers under Medicare Part D and are required to adhere to certain requirements applicable to Medicare Part D. Additionally, we are subject to CMS rules regarding the administration of our Medicare plans and pricing between our plans and related parties, including our pharmacy business. Other statutes and regulations affect our home delivery and specialty pharmacy operations, including the federal and state anti-kickback laws, federal and state false claims acts and the federal civil monetary penalty law described above. Federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling, packaging, repackaging, compounding, storing, holding, disposal, distribution, advertising, misbranding, adulteration, transfer, handling and security of prescription drugs and the dispensing of prescription, over-the-counter,  30 30 30   hazardous and controlled substances and certain of our pharmacies must register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities. The FTC requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising, to stock a reasonable supply of the product to be sold, to fill mail orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate. The United States Postal Service also has significant statutory authority to restrict the delivery of drugs and medicines through the mail. Violations of pharmacy laws and regulations may result in warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, suspension, termination or revocation of licenses and registrations, restrictions on facilities or operations, and other enforcement actions.  Financial Reporting, Internal Control and Corporate Governance Regulators closely monitor the financial condition of licensed insurance companies and HMOs. States regulate the form and content of statutory financial statements, the type and concentration of permitted investments and corporate governance over financial reporting. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries are required to file periodic financial reports and schedules with regulators in most of the jurisdictions in which they do business as well as annual financial statements audited by independent registered public accounting firms. Certain insurance and HMO subsidiaries are required to file an annual report of internal control over financial reporting with most jurisdictions in which they do business. Insurance and HMO subsidiaries' operations and financial statements are subject to examination by such agencies. Many states have expanded regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of insurance and HMO subsidiaries as a result of model regulations adopted by the NAIC with elements similar to corporate governance and risk oversight disclosure requirements under federal securities laws. Guaranty Associations, Indemnity Funds, Risk Pools and Administrative Funds Most states and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds that are established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and other payors, such as consumer operated and oriented plans (co-ops) established under the ACA. In the United States, these associations levy assessments on member insurers licensed in a particular state to pay such claims. Certain states require HMOs to participate in guaranty funds, special risk pools and administrative funds. For additional information about guaranty funds and other assessments, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain states continue to require health insurers and HMOs to participate in assigned risk plans, joint underwriting authorities, pools or other residual market mechanisms to cover risks not acceptable under normal underwriting standards, although some states have eliminated these requirements as a result of the ACA. Solvency and Capital Requirements Many states have adopted some form of the NAIC model solvency-related laws and risk-based capital (\"RBC\") rules for life and health insurance companies and HMOs. The RBC rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held, the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred. If the ratio of the insurer's adjusted surplus to its RBC falls below statutorily required minimums, the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship. In addition, various non-U.S. jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency, liquidity and reserve coverage measures. Our HMOs and life and health insurance subsidiaries, as well as non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries, are compliant with applicable RBC and non-U.S. surplus rules. The Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (\"ORSA\"), adopted by the NAIC, provides requirements and principles for maintaining a group solvency assessment and a risk management framework and reflects a broader approach to U.S. insurance regulation. ORSA includes a requirement to file an annual ORSA Summary Report in the lead state of domicile. To date, an overwhelming majority of the states have adopted the same or similar versions of ORSA. We file our ORSA report annually as required. Holding Company Laws Our domestic insurance companies and certain of our HMOs are subject to state laws regulating subsidiaries of insurance holding companies. Under such laws, certain dividends, distributions and other transactions between an insurance company or an HMO subsidiary and its affiliates may require notification to, or approval by, one or more state insurance commissioners. In addition, the holding company acts of states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO subsidiary without prior regulatory approval. State holding company laws and regulations also subject our insurance companies and certain HMO subsidiaries to additional regulatory scrutiny related to their oversight of affiliates  31 31 31   performing regulated services on behalf of the insurance company or HMO and require the Company to file an annual Enterprise Risk Report, which summarizes material risks that could pose enterprise risk to the insurance company subsidiaries. Marketing, Advertising and Products In most states, our insurance companies and HMO subsidiaries are required to certify compliance with applicable advertising regulations on an annual basis. Our insurance companies and HMO subsidiaries are also required by most states to file and secure regulatory approval of products prior to the marketing, advertising and sale of such products. Licensing and Registration Requirements Our insurance companies and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. Additionally, certain subsidiaries contract to provide claim administration, utilization management and other related services for the administration of self-insured benefit plans. These subsidiaries may be subject to state third-party administration and other licensing requirements and regulation, as well as third-party accreditation requirements. We have received full accreditation for Utilization Review Accreditation Commission Pharmacy Benefit Management version 2.2 Standards, which includes quality standards for drug utilization management, and select subsidiaries have received full accreditation for Utilization Review Accreditation Commission for Health Utilization Management version 7.2, which includes quality standards for medical utilization management. Certain states have adopted pharmacy benefit management registration, licensure or disclosure laws. In addition to registration laws, some states have adopted legislation mandating disclosure of various aspects of our financial practices, including those concerning pharmaceutical company revenue, as well as prescribing processes for prescription switching programs and client and provider audit terms. Our international subsidiaries are often required to be licensed when entering new markets or starting new operations in certain jurisdictions. The licensure requirements for these subsidiaries vary by country and are subject to change. International Regulations Our operations outside of the United States expose us to laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies and regulators, including those related to the provision of insurance, financial and other disclosures, the provision of health care-related services, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, data mining, data transfer, intellectual property, labor and employment, consumer protection, direct-to-consumer communications activities, tax, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. Foreign laws and rules may include requirements that are different from, or more stringent than, similar requirements in the United States. Our operations in countries outside of the United States: \u2022are subject to local regulations of the jurisdictions where we operate; \u2022in some cases, are subject to regulations in the jurisdictions where customers reside; and \u2022in all cases, are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"). Anti-money laundering requirements in countries where we do business also may impose obligations to collect certain information about each customer at time of sale or to risk rank each customer to determine possible future money laundering risk. The FCPA prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official or employee to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Outside of the United States, we may interact with government officials in several different capacities: as regulators of our insurance business; as clients or partners who are state-owned or partially state-owned; as health care providers who are employed by the government; as hospitals that are state-owned; and as officials issuing permits in connection with real estate transactions. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and DOJ have increased their enforcement activities with respect to FCPA. The UK Bribery Act of 2010 applies to all companies with a nexus to the United Kingdom. Under this act, any voluntary disclosures of FCPA violations may be shared with United Kingdom authorities, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. Other countries in which we do business also have anti-corruption laws to which we are subject. 32 32 32   ", "time": "00:00:06"}
