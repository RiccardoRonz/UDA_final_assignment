This content also reaches millions of individual investors via customer portals and the intranets of brokerage and trading firms, as well as digital media publishers. Dow Jones Newswires is also used as an input for algorithms supporting automated trading.  The Dow Jones segment\u2019s businesses compete with a wide range of media and information businesses, including print publications, digital media and information services. The Dow Jones segment\u2019s consumer products, including its newspapers, magazines, digital publications, podcasts and video, compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and app-based media, news aggregators, customized news feeds, search engines, blogs, magazines, investment tools, social media sources, podcasts and event producers, as well as other media such as television, radio stations and outdoor displays. Competition for subscriptions and circulation is based on news and editorial content, data and analytics content in research tools, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. Competition for advertising is based upon advertisers\u2019 judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors, including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates, advertising effectiveness and brand strength and reputation. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies (including recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI), distribution platforms and business models, and corresponding changes in consumer behavior, the consumer-focused businesses within the Dow Jones segment continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue, including from a variety of alternative news and information sources, as well as programmatic advertising buying channels and  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents off-platform distribution of its products. Shifts in consumer behavior require the Company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. The Company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges, and that it is well positioned to leverage its global reach, brand recognition and proprietary technology to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes. The Dow Jones segment\u2019s professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers, global financial newswires and energy and commodities pricing and data providers, including Reuters News, RELX (including LexisNexis and ICIS), Refinitiv, S&P Global, DTN and Argus Media, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data.

Additionally, in the U.K., HarperCollins publishes titles for the equivalent of the K-12 educational market.  As of June 30, 2023, HarperCollins offered approximately 150,000 publications in digital formats, and nearly all of HarperCollins\u2019 new titles, as well as the majority of its entire catalog, are available as e-books. Digital sales, comprising revenues generated through the sale of e-books as well as downloadable audio books, represented approximately 22% of global consumer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.  During fiscal 2023, HarperCollins U.S. had 171 titles on the New York Times print and digital bestseller lists, with 28 titles hitting number one, including Amari and The Great Game by B.B.

HarperCollins derives its revenue from the sale of print and digital books to a customer base that includes global technology companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble and Tesco. Revenues at the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of HarperCollins\u2019 books in the marketplace, and are typically highest during the Company\u2019s second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies.  The book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations. HarperCollins competes with other large publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster and Hachette Livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants as barriers to entry in book publishing are low. In addition, HarperCollins competes for consumers with other media formats and sources such as movies, television programming, magazines and mobile content. The Company believes HarperCollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies.

The News Media segment generates revenue primarily through circulation and subscription sales of its print and digital products and sales of print and digital advertising. Advertising revenues at the News Media segment are subject to seasonality, with revenues typically highest in the Company\u2019s second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies.

The News Media segment\u2019s newspapers, magazines, digital publications, radio stations, television station and podcasts generally face competition from similar sources, and compete on similar bases, as the consumer products within the Dow Jones segment, particularly in their respective operating geographies. See \u201cItem 1. Business \u2013 Business Overview \u2013 Dow Jones\u201d above for further information. Other The Other segment includes the Company\u2019s general corporate overhead expenses, strategy costs and costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. 10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Governmental Regulation General Various aspects of the Company\u2019s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company\u2019s products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in existing laws and regulations in those countries or the enforcement thereof, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s interests. Australian Media Regulation The Company\u2019s subscription television interests are subject to Australia\u2019s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry, including the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (the \u201cBroadcasting Services Act\u201d) and associated Codes. The key regulatory body for the Australian broadcasting industry is the Australian Communications and Media Authority. Key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions\u2014currently under the \u2018anti-siphoning\u2019 provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act, subscription broadcast television providers are restricted from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the Olympic Games and certain Australian Football League and cricket matches) unless a national or commercial television broadcaster whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50% of the Australian population has acquired the right to televise the event or such rights have not been acquired 26 weeks before the start of the relevant event and an FTA broadcaster has had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights to that event; and (b) content requirements\u2014the Company must comply with certain content requirements, including restrictions on the inclusion of gambling advertising during live sporting events.  Foxtel is also subject to various consumer protection regimes under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth), the Telecommunications Act 1999 (Cth) and associated Codes, which apply to Foxtel\u2019s provision of broadband and voice services to retail customers. The Company\u2019s Australian operating businesses are subject to other parts of the Broadcasting Services Act that may impact the Company\u2019s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. Benchmark Regulation In connection with the OPIS business, the Company has established its own benchmark administrator, OPIS Benchmark Administration B.V. (the \u201cAdministrator\u201d), organized in the Netherlands and authorized under the EU Benchmarks Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the \u201cEU BMR\u201d) by the Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (the \u201cAFM\u201d). The Administrator oversees compliance with principles, policies and procedures governing conflicts of interest, complaints handling, input data, benchmark methodologies and other matters for any price assessments and benchmarks under its administration. The Administrator has published on its website policies and other materials governing such administration, including a benchmark statement as well as policies and procedures concerning methodologies, complaints, corrections and material changes. The Administrator currently oversees two OPIS price assessments, which are not presently used as a reference for trading on an EU exchange and consequently are not benchmarks within the meaning of the EU BMR and not subject to supervision by the AFM. The OPIS business plans to have one or more benchmarks that will be used as a reference for trading on an EU exchange in the future, and such benchmarks would become subject to supervision by the AFM. The OPIS business has also aligned its oil and commodities price reporting, including the two price assessments currently administered by the Administrator, with the International Organisation of Securities Commission\u2019s (\u201cIOSCO\u2019s\u201d) Principles for Oil Reporting Agencies, which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil and commodity price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Data Privacy and Security Regulation The Company\u2019s business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. For example, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements. More state and local governments are also expanding, enacting or proposing data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and establish or increase penalties and in some cases, afford private rights of action to individuals  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents for failure to comply, and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personal information has been accessed or disclosed as a result of a data breach. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), establishes certain transparency rules, puts greater restrictions on how the Company can collect, use and share personal information of California residents and provides California residents with certain rights regarding their personal information. The CPRA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Similar legislation in many states impose transparency and other obligations with respect to personal data of their respective residents and provide residents with similar rights, with the exception of a private right of action. Additionally, certain of the Company\u2019s websites, mobile apps and other online business activities are also subject to laws and regulations governing the online privacy of children, including the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which prohibits the collection of personal information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent, and the California Age Appropriate Design Code (which goes into effect on July 1, 2024), which prescribes rules relating to the design of online services likely to be accessed by children under age 18 (\u201cCAADC\u201d). Similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the European Union, the U.K. and Australia. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which provides a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the European Union, and the U.K. adopted the Data Protection Act of 2018 (the \u201cUK DPA\u201d) as well as the UK General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d). The GDPR, UK DPA and UK GDPR expand the regulation of the collection, processing, use, sharing and security of personal data, contain stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthen the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continue to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, require companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, require mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increase maximum penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million Euros or 17 million pounds, as applicable, or 4% of an entity\u2019s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increase the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. The European Union also plans to replace its existing e-Privacy Directive with a new e-Privacy Regulation that will complement the GDPR and amend certain rules, including with respect to cookies and other similar technologies that the Company utilizes to obtain information from visitors to the Company\u2019s various digital offerings. Reform of the U.K. data protection framework is currently under discussion as the Data Protection and Digital Information (No. 2) Bill progresses through the U.K. legislative process. The Bill in its current form would also make certain amendments to the U.K.\u2019s regulations implementing the European Union\u2019s e-Privacy Directive. In addition, the U.K. has adopted the UK Age Appropriate Design Code, which is similar to the CAADC discussed above. The Company and some of its service providers rely on certain mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to address the European and U.K. data protection requirements for transfers of data that continue to evolve and are often subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. In June 2021, the European Commission adopted two new sets of European Union Standard Contractual Clauses, which regulate the relationship between controller and processor in accordance with the GDPR and international data transfers to a third country in the absence of an adequacy decision under the GDPR. The European Data Protection Board also adopted recommendations on measures that supplement data transfer tools to ensure compliance with the level of personal data protection required in Europe, including requirements for data exporters to assess the risks related to the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area and to implement, if necessary, additional contractual, organizational and technical measures such as encryption and pseudonymization. For data transfers subject to the UK GDPR, the International Data Transfer Agreement and the International Data Transfer Addendum to the European Union Standard Contractual Clauses have also been adopted. With respect to data transfers to the U.S., the European Commission has recently adopted the adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and a corresponding decision from the U.K. is also expected. Such evolving requirements could cause the Company to incur additional costs, require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services. In Australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. Industry participants in the U.S., Europe and Australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the Company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. The interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain and evolving in the United States and internationally. Moreover, data privacy and security laws vary between local, state, federal and international jurisdictions and may  12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The Company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the Company\u2019s data privacy and security compliance programs. U.K. Press Regulation As a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, a Press Recognition Panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established. Once approved by the Press Recognition Panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. In addition to the Press Recognition Panel, certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and, if Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 is commenced, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. Press regulator IMPRESS was recognized as an approved regulator by the Press Recognition Panel on October 25, 2016. However, publications representing the majority of the industry in the U.K., including News UK, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, or IPSO, in September 2014. IPSO currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the Press Recognition Panel. IPSO has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. IPSO oversees the Editors\u2019 Code of Practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the Editors\u2019 Code of Practice and levy fines of up to \u00a31 million. The burdens IPSO imposes on its print media members, including the Company\u2019s newspaper publishing businesses in the U.K., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. U.K. Radio and Television Broadcasting Regulation The Company\u2019s radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland and TalkTV are subject to regulation by the Office of Communications (Ofcom), the regulatory body for broadcasting in the U.K. In accordance with Ofcom\u2019s regulations, the Company is required, among other things, to obtain and maintain licenses to operate these radio stations and TalkTV. Although the Company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Non-compliance by the Company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of Ofcom, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. Intellectual Property The Company\u2019s intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, video programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. These licenses include: (1) the sports programming rights licenses for the National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Australia, V8 Supercars, Formula One and other broadcasting rights described in Note 16 to the Financial Statements; (2) licenses from various third parties of patents and other technology for the set-top boxes and related operating and conditional access systems used in the Company\u2019s subscription television business; (3) the trademark license for the Realtor.com\u00ae website address, as well as the REALTOR\u00ae trademark (the \u201cNAR License\u201d); and (4) the trademark licenses for the use of FOX formative trademarks used in the Company\u2019s pay-TV business in Australia (the \u201cFox Licenses\u201d). In addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. The Company derives value and revenue from its intellectual property assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, subscriptions to its pay-TV services and distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to other television services, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services and the operation of websites and other digital properties. The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other foreign territories. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Unauthorized use, including in the digital environment and as a result of recent advances in AI, particularly generative AI, presents a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. Policing unauthorized use of the Company\u2019s products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Company\u2019s intellectual property. For example, the Company seeks to limit the threat of piracy by, among other means, preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions. The Company also seeks to limit unauthorized use of its intellectual property by pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. However, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company also engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company\u2019s intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations. Raw Materials As a major publisher of newspapers, magazines and books, the Company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. In order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the Company\u2019s paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. The Company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate, although prices increased significantly in fiscal 2023. While the Company anticipates these increases will moderate, it expects prices to remain elevated. Human Capital News Corp\u2019s workforce is critical to the creation and delivery of its premium and trusted content and a key contributor to the success of the company. The Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain and engage talented employees with the skills and capabilities needed by its businesses is an essential component of its long-term business strategy to become more global and more digital, and the capabilities of the Company\u2019s workforce have continued to evolve along with its business and strategy.
