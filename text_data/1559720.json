{"cik": 1559720, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business  Overview  We are a community based on connection and belonging\u2014a community that was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed over 1.4 billion guest arrivals to over 100,000 cities and towns in almost every country and region across the globe. Hosts on Airbnb are everyday people who share their worlds to provide guests with the feeling of connection and being at home. We strive to connect people and places.   Airbnb has five stakeholders and is designed with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve Hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive.   A Resilient Model   As we look forward, we recognize the potential impact of the challenging macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates, potential decreased consumer spending, and the continued disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel across the world.  We believe we are well positioned for the road ahead due to our adaptability and relentless innovation. First, our business model is adaptable. We have nearly every type of space in nearly every location, so however travel changes, we are able to adapt. Regardless of the economic environment, our guests come to Airbnb because they can find great value, and our Hosts can earn extra income. Second, we\u2019ve relentlessly innovated while also staying focused and disciplined. During the height of the pandemic, we made many difficult choices to reduce our spending, making us a leaner and more focused company, and we have kept this discipline ever since.  Our Long-Term Growth Strategy   Our strategy is to continue to invest in our key strengths:   \u2022Unlock more hosting. We will continue to invest in growing the size and quality of our Host community. We plan to attract more Hosts globally by expanding use cases and supporting all different types of Hosts, including those who host occasionally. We will also continue to increase the support that we provide to our Hosts to deliver high-quality stays and experiences for guests.   \u2022Grow and engage our guest community. We intend to continue to attract new guests to Airbnb and will continue to focus on engaging our existing guests to return to book and to use Airbnb with more frequency. With new behaviors developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the ways that people approach work, living, and travel have fundamentally changed. We believe there will be further opportunities to enhance our offerings based on these new behaviors and attract more guests to our platform.   \u2022Invest in our brand. We intend to continue to invest in our brand to educate new Hosts and guests on the benefits of Airbnb and the uniqueness of our offerings. We will continue to leverage our brand through a cohesive and integrated marketing strategy punctuated by our two product launches per year.   \u2022Expand our global network. We plan to expand our global network and continue to partner with communities to update laws and regulations for short-term rentals to allow more Hosts to join our platform.   \u2022Design new products and offerings. Our innovations are focused on improving our Host and guest experiences, making Airbnb more accessible and appealing for new Hosts and guests and driving increased engagement and loyalty with our existing community. We have made over 340 upgrades to our platform over the past two years, making it even easier to host and guests to book on Airbnb.   Our Platform   Our Platform for Hosts   We built our platform to seamlessly onboard new Hosts, especially those who previously had not considered hosting. We partner with Hosts throughout the process of setting up their listing and provide them with a robust suite of tools to successfully manage their listings, including scheduling, merchandising, integrated payments, community support, Host protections, pricing guidance, and feedback from reviews. In November 2022, we launched Airbnb Setup, which is a new way to easily list a home, with free one-to-one guidance from a Superhost Ambassador.  We count the number of Hosts on our platform based on the number of users with available listings, defined as accommodations and experiences that are viewable on our platform (excluding HotelTonight), as of a certain date. We consider a listing of a home or an experience to be an \"active listing\" if it is viewable on Airbnb and has been previously booked at least once on Airbnb (excluding HotelTonight). In July 2022, all of our mainland Chinese listings were taken down as part of our decision to close the domestic business in China and instead focus on the outbound China business. As of December 31, 2022, we had 6.6 million active listings globally.   3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Our Platform for Guests   Our website and mobile apps provide our guests with an engaging way to explore a wide variety of unique homes and experiences and an easy way to book them. To better meet the needs of our guests in 2022, we launched a new way to search on Airbnb designed around Airbnb Categories, with over 60 new categories that organize homes based on their style, location, or proximity to a travel activity. In June 2022, we also launched travel insurance for guests to provide guests in certain jurisdictions with the option to insure guest reservations against certain risks associated with their bookings.  Our System of Trust   The system for trust that we have designed includes the following components: Host and guest reviews, account protection, risk scoring, secure payments, a nondiscrimination policy, watchlist and background checks in certain jurisdictions, cleanliness, fraud and scam prevention, insurance and similar protections, booking restrictions, an urgent safety line, a 24/7 neighborhood support line, and a guest refund policy.   We offer top-to-bottom protection for our Hosts through AirCover for Hosts, which we expanded in November 2022. AirCover for Hosts includes, among other features, guest property damage protection of up to $3 million per stay, liability coverage to Hosts of up to $1 million per occurrence in the event of third-party claims of personal injury or property damage, deep cleaning protection, and pet damage protection.   In addition to AirCover for Hosts, we introduced AirCover for guests in May 2022. AirCover for guests provides guests with a booking protection guarantee, a check-in guarantee, a \u201cget-what-you-booked\u201d guarantee, and a 24-hour safety support line.   We have new initiatives under development and will continue to create additional features to strengthen the trust and safety on our platform.   Our Technology   Our technology platform powers our two-sided marketplace and enables our global network of Hosts and guests. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had more than 1,900 engineers within our product development organization. Given the nature of the business, our technology platform has broad and complex requirements:   \u2022Support of global payments. It supports global payment capabilities; multilingual, real-time, community safety and support; city-specific regulatory support; and sophisticated anti-fraud and anti-money-laundering measures.   \u2022Delivery of deep business insights. It delivers deep business intelligence insights to manage our marketplace, including pricing insights and occupancy optimization for our Hosts.   \u2022Incorporation of sophisticated machine learning. It incorporates sophisticated machine learning to power key areas, from fraud detection, to enabling customized and real-time community support.   \u2022Operation of a microservices architecture. We operate a microservices architecture and are evolving our foundational components to enable us to move rapidly in response to evolving customer needs without sacrificing correctness or stability.   As we continue to evolve our foundational technology, we are focused on the following broad capabilities:   \u2022Data management systems that continue to support user privacy, analytics, machine learning, and business insights.  \u2022Service reliability leading to best-in-class performance centered on availability, latency, disaster recovery and business continuity, security, testability, observability, operability, and agility.  \u2022Cloud support focusing on robust capabilities for granular attribution and usage patterns to realize efficiency gains.   These continued technology investments aim to ensure we have a robust platform that allows us to more quickly adapt to the needs of our Hosts and guests around the world and increase the productivity of our product development organization.   Our Marketing   Our marketing strategy includes brand marketing, communications, and performance marketing. Brand marketing increases awareness among potential Hosts and guests, helping them understand the benefits of hosting and booking stays and experiences, and what makes these stays and experiences distinctly Airbnb. Our global communications team works across press, policy, and influencers to share timely and important news about Airbnb. They also oversee the execution of a global consumer, product, corporate, and policy-communications plan that supports our brand strategy and generates considerable press and social media coverage. While performance marketing drives additional traffic from high-intent prospective guests, the strength of the Airbnb brand and our communications strategy allows us to be less reliant on performance marketing.   Human Capital  We consider the management of our global talent to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had 6,811 employees.  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents As of December\u00a031, 2022, we relied on a global network of approximately 11,000 third-party contingent workers to handle the vast majority of our community support contacts. Our internal community support employees are comprised of operations teams who handle complex and sensitive issues, and enablement teams who support all community-facing teams, including our partners.  Attracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent enables us to provide our Hosts and guests with innovative products and services as well as serve our other stakeholders. As of December\u00a031, 2022, 49% of our global employees identify in the gender binary as women and 16% of our U.S.-based employees identify as under-represented minorities. Through our hiring process, we commit to encouraging diversity and eliminating bias, and we publish the changing demographic makeup of our workforce to hold ourselves accountable. We are also focused on supporting our employees across the full employee lifecycle from recruitment to onboarding to ongoing development.   Given the productivity of our workforce throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2022, we announced our Live and Work Anywhere policy. This policy allows for the vast majority of our employees to work remotely on a permanent basis. We believe that expanding our talent pool beyond the commuting radius near our offices will allow us to attract the best and most diverse employees over time. We aim to create a highly coordinated working culture, and as such, will continue to promote ways to keep employees highly engaged and connected by aligning employees\u2019 work through our roadmap, as well as curating employee collaboration sessions either in the office or at off-site locations.  Climate Change  In 2021, we announced our commitment to operating as a Net Zero company for our global corporate operations by 2030. To meet our goal, we have committed to a number of steps, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with our corporate operations, and investing in quality nature-based solutions to offset residual emissions. This commitment is the latest step we are taking to help address the climate crisis. In 2020 and 2021, we achieved 100 percent renewable energy in our global offices, fulfilling a commitment we made in 2020, by purchasing energy attribute certificates sufficient to match our global electricity use for our corporate operations for those years. Additionally, in early 2021, we became a founding participant in the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance Coalition, a new public-private initiative that has mobilized $1 billion to fight tropical deforestation.   Regulations  We are subject to laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business at city, state, country, and regional levels. While a number of cities and countries have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals, there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short-term rental laws, and could follow suit and enact regulations. We seek to work with governments to establish clear, fair, and workable home sharing rules to create clarity for our Hosts.  No single city represented more than 1.3% of our revenue before adjustments for incentives and refunds during the year ended December\u00a031, 2022 or 1.1% of our active listings as of December\u00a031, 2022. Incentives include our referral programs and marketing promotions to encourage the use of our platform and attract new Hosts and guests, while our refunds to Hosts and guests are part of our support activities. We do not believe that the current regulations in our top 10 cities, in the aggregate, have had or are expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to collaborate with policymakers to implement sensible legislation around the world.   In addition to laws, regulations, and rules directly applicable to the short-term rental and home sharing business, we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and rules governing our business practices, the Internet, e-commerce, and electronic devices, including those relating to taxation, privacy, data privacy, data security, pricing, content, advertising, discrimination, consumer protection, protection of minors, copyrights, distribution, messaging, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, electronic contracts, communications, Internet access, competition, and unfair commercial practices. We are also subject to laws, regulations, and rules governing the provision of online payment services, the design and operation of our platform, and the operations, characteristics, and quality of our platform and services. Additionally, we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the United States (federal, state, and local) and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Our payments platform is subject to various laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance, including those governing: cross-border and domestic money transmission and funds transfers; stored value and prepaid access; foreign exchange; data privacy, data security, and cybersecurity; banking secrecy; payment services (including payment processing and settlement services); consumer protection; economic and trade sanctions; anti-corruption and anti-bribery; and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing.  Our business collects, processes and uses the personal data of individuals across the globe. As a result, compliance with laws on data privacy and data security regulating the storage, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal data is core to our strategy and integral to the creation of trust in our platform. We take a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols to protect data, including data pertaining to Hosts, guests, employees, and others. Despite measures we put in place, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to such data.  Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. This increases the complexity of compliance requirements, may limit offerings, and result in additional expenses while also diverting attention and resources from other projects. Regulators around the world continue to propose more stringent data privacy and data security laws, and these laws are rapidly increasing in number, complexity, enforcement, fines, and penalties. Data privacy and data security laws and their interpretations continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.   5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents As we continue to expand the reach of our brand into additional markets, we will be increasingly subject to additional laws, regulations, and rules.   For additional information regarding these and other laws, regulations, and rules that affect us and our business, see Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies \u2013 Legal and Regulatory Matters \u2013 Regulatory Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Seasonality  Our business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. In a typical year, the first, second, and third quarters have higher Nights and Experiences Booked than the fourth quarter, as guests plan for travel during the peak travel season, which is in the third quarter for North America and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d). Our key business metrics, including Gross Booking Value (\u201cGBV\u201d) and Adjusted EBITDA, can also be impacted by the timing of holidays and other events. We experience seasonality in our GBV that is generally consistent with the seasonality of Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highest in the third quarter when we have the most check-ins, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. Seasonal trends in our GBV impact Free Cash Flow for any given quarter. Our costs are relatively fixed across quarters or vary in line with the volume of transactions, and we historically achieve our highest GBV in the first and second quarters of the year with comparatively lower check-ins. As a result, increases in unearned fees generally make our Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue the highest in the first two quarters of the year. We typically see a slight decline in GBV and a peak in check-ins in the third quarter, which results in a decrease in unearned fees and lower sequential level of Free Cash Flow, and a greater decline in GBV in the fourth quarter, where Free Cash Flow is typically lower. As our business matures, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme. See the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d included in Item 7 of Part 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for definitions of our key business metrics.  While we saw COVID-19 distort the historical patterns of seasonality for our GBV, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in 2020 and 2021 as a result of travel restrictions and changing travel preferences relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw pre-pandemic patterns of seasonality return in 2022.  Competition   We operate in a highly competitive environment. As we seek to expand our community globally, we face competition in attracting Hosts and guests.   Competition for Hosts   We compete to attract and retain Hosts to and on our platform to list their homes and experiences, as Hosts have a range of options for doing so. We compete for Hosts based on many factors including the volume of bookings generated by guests, ease of use of our platform, the service fees we charge, Host protections, such as those included in AirCover for Hosts, and our brand.   Competition for Guests   We compete to attract and retain guests to and on our platform, as guests have a range of options to find and book accommodations and experiences. We compete for guests based on many factors, including unique inventory and availability of listings, the value and all-in cost of Host offerings on our platform relative to other options, our brand, ease of use of our platform, the trust and safety of our platform, and community support.   Our competitors include:   \u2022Online travel agencies (\u201cOTAs\u201d), such as Booking Holdings (including the brands Booking.com, KAYAK, Priceline.com, and Agoda.com); Expedia Group (including the brands Expedia, Vrbo, HomeAway, Hotels.com, Orbitz, and Travelocity); Trip.com Group (including the brands Ctrip.com, Trip.com, Qunar, Tongcheng-eLong, and SkyScanner); Hopper; Meituan Dianping; Fliggy (a subsidiary of Alibaba); Despegar; MakeMyTrip; and other regional OTAs;  \u2022Internet search engines, such as Google, including its travel search products; Baidu; and other regional search engines; \u2022Listing and meta search websites, such as TripAdvisor, Trivago, Mafengwo, AllTheRooms.com, Hometogo, Holidu, and Craigslist; \u2022Hotel chains, such as Marriott, Hilton, Accor, Wyndham, InterContinental, OYO, and Huazhu, as well as boutique hotel chains and independent hotels; \u2022Property management companies, such as Vacasa, Sonder, Inspirato, Evolve, Awaze, and other regional property management companies; and \u2022Online platforms offering experiences, such as Viator, GetYourGuide, Klook, Traveloka, TUI Musement, and KKDay.
