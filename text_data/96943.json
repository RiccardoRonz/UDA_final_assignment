{"cik": 96943, "item_1A": "ITEM\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS Teleflex Incorporated is referred to herein as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cTeleflex\u201d and the \u201cCompany.\u201d THE COMPANY Teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits, improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs. We primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. We market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. Because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. Our major manufacturing operations are located in the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Mexico and the United States (the \"U.S.\"). We are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through: \u2022development of new products and product line extensions; \u2022investment in new technologies and broadening the application of our existing technologies; \u2022expansion of the use of our products in existing markets and introduction of our products into new geographic markets; \u2022achievement of economies of scale as we continue to expand by utilizing our direct sales force and distribution network to sell new products, as well as by increasing efficiencies in our sales and marketing organizations, research and development activities and manufacturing and distribution facilities; and \u2022expansion of our product portfolio through select acquisitions, licensing arrangements and business partnerships that enhance, expand or expedite our development initiatives or our ability to increase our market share.  Our research and development capabilities, commitment to engineering excellence and focus on low-cost manufacturing enable us to bring to market cost effective, innovative products that improve the safety, efficacy and quality of healthcare. Our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications, as well as developing enhancements to, and product line extensions of, existing products. During 2022 we introduced several product line extensions and six new products. Our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of Class I and Class II medical devices, most of which require 510(k) clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for sale in the U.S., and some of which are exempt from the requirement to obtain 510(k) clearance. We believe that seeking 510(k) clearance or qualifying for 510(k)-exempt status reduces our research and development costs and risks, and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval, or PMA, process that would be required for Class III medical devices. See \"Government Regulation\" below for additional information. HISTORY AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical push/pull controls for military aircraft. From this original single market, single product orientation, we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses, development of new products, introduction of products into new geographic or end-markets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses. Throughout our history, we have continually focused on providing innovative, technology-driven, specialty-engineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements. Beginning in 2007, we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses, expanding our presence in the medical device industry, while divesting all of our other businesses, which served the aerospace, automotive, industrial and marine markets. Following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011, we became exclusively a medical device company. In 2017, we completed two large scale acquisitions: NeoTract, Inc. (\"NeoTract\") and Vascular Solutions, Inc. (\u201cVascular Solutions\u201d). NeoTract was a medical device company that developed and commercialized the UroLift System, a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. Vascular Solutions was a medical device company that developed and marketed clinical products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures.  4 4 4   In 2021, we divested certain product lines within our global respiratory product portfolio to Medline Industries, Inc. (\u201cMedline\u201d) (the \"Respiratory business divestiture\"). We completed the initial phase of the Respiratory business divestiture on June 28, 2021. The second and final phase of the Respiratory business divestiture will occur once we transfer certain additional manufacturing assets to Medline and is expected to occur prior to the end of 2023. See \"Our Products\" below and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. We expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. In addition, we may identify further opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that no longer meet our objectives.   Restructuring programs  We continue to execute our footprint realignment and other restructuring programs designed to improve efficiencies in our manufacturing and distribution facilities and, to a lesser extent, our sales and marketing and research and development organizations. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. OUR SEGMENTS We have four segments: Americas, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), Asia (Asia Pacific) and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer and Development Services).   Each of our three geographic segments provides a comprehensive portfolio of medical technology products used by hospitals and healthcare providers. However, certain of our products are more heavily concentrated within certain segments. For example, most of our urology products are sold by our EMEA segment and most of our interventional urology products are sold by our Americas segment. Our product portfolio is described in the products section below.     Our OEM segment designs, manufactures and supplies devices and instruments for other medical device manufacturers. Our OEM division, which includes the TFX Medical OEM, TFX OEM, Deknatel and HPC Medical  brands, provides custom extrusions, micro-diameter film-cast tubing, diagnostic and interventional catheters, balloons and balloon catheters, film-insulated fine wire, coated mandrel wire, conductors, sheath/dilator introducers, specialized sutures and performance fibers, bioabsorbable sutures, yarns and resins.  The following charts depict our net revenues by reportable operating segment as a percentage of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December\u00a031, 2022, 2021 and 2020:   OUR PRODUCTS Our product categories within our geographic segments include vascular access, anesthesia, interventional, surgical, interventional urology, respiratory and urology. Each of these categories and the key products sold therein are described in more detail below. 5 5 5   Vascular Access: Our Vascular Access product category offers devices that facilitate a variety of critical care therapies and other applications with a focus on helping reduce vascular-related complications. These products primarily consist of our Arrow branded catheters, catheter navigation and tip positioning systems and our intraosseous, or in the bone, access systems.  Our catheters are used in a wide range of procedures, including the administration of intravenous therapies, the measurement of blood pressure and the withdrawal of blood samples through a single puncture site. Many of our catheters provide antimicrobial and antithrombogenic protection technology that have been shown to reduce the risk of catheter related bloodstream infections and microbial colonization and thrombus accumulation on catheter surfaces. Our intraosseous access systems are designed for the delivery of medications and fluids when intravenous access is difficult to obtain in emergent, urgent or medically necessary cases. Our products offer a method for vascular access that can be administered quickly and effectively in the hospital and pre-hospital environments and include the EZ-IO Intraosseous Vascular Access System and Arrow FAST1 Sternal Intraosseous Infusion System. Interventional: Our Interventional product category offers devices that facilitate a variety of applications to diagnose and deliver treatment via the vascular system of the body. These products primarily consist of a variety of coronary catheters, structural heart support devices, peripheral intervention products and mechanical circulatory support platform used by interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. Clinical benefits of our products include increased vein and artery access, post-procedure closure, and increased support during complex medical procedures. Our primary product offerings consist of a portfolio of Arrow branded intra-aortic balloon pumps and catheters, GuideLiner, Turnpike and TrapLiner catheters, the MANTA Vascular Closure device and Arrow OnControl powered bone biopsy system.  Anesthesia: Our Anesthesia product category is comprised of airway, pain management and hemostatic product lines that support hospital, emergency medicine and military channels.   Our airway management products and related devices are designed to enable use of standard and advanced anesthesia techniques in both pre-hospital emergency and hospital settings. Our key products include laryngoscopes, supraglottic airways, endotracheal tubes and atomization devices, which are branded under our LMA, Rusch and MAD trade names.  Our pain management product line includes epidurals, catheters and disposable pain pumps for regional anesthesia, designed to improve patients\u2019 post-operative pain experience, which are branded under our Arrow trade name. Our hemostatic products accelerate the body's natural clotting cascade and are used in trauma situations where bleeding is difficult to control. The portfolio consists of external hemostats used by first responders, interventional products used in the catheter lab, and trauma products used by trauma surgeons, which are branded under our QuikClot trade name. Surgical: Our Surgical product category consists of single-use and reusable products designed to provide surgeons with devices for use in a variety of surgical procedures. These products primarily consist of metal and polymer ligation clips, fascial closure surgical systems used in laparoscopic surgical procedures, percutaneous surgical systems and other surgical instruments. Our significant surgical brands include Weck, MiniLap, Pleur-Evac, Deknatel, KMedic and Pilling. In 2022, we expanded our product portfolio with the acquisition of Standard Bariatrics, Inc. (\u201cStandard Bariatrics\u201d) and the Titan SGS brand, a powered stapling technology for bariatric surgery.  Interventional Urology: Our interventional urology product category includes the UroLift System, a minimally invasive technology for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. The UroLift System involves the placement of permanent implants, typically through a transurethral outpatient procedure, that hold the prostate lobes apart to relieve compression on the urethra without cutting, heating or removing prostate tissue. Our Interventional Urology product portfolio is most heavily weighted in our Americas segment. Respiratory: Our respiratory products are used in a variety of care settings and primarily consist of humidification and oxygen therapy products. The Respiratory business divestiture included products marketed under the Hudson RCI brand name that comprised oxygen therapy products, aerosol therapy products, spirometry products and ventilation management products. 6 6 6   Urology: Our urology product portfolio provides bladder management for patients in the hospital and individuals in the home care markets. The product portfolio consists principally of a wide range of catheters (including Foley and intermittent), urine collectors, catheterization accessories and products for operative endourology, which are marketed under the Teleflex and Rusch brand names. Our urology product portfolio is most heavily weighted in our EMEA segment. OUR MARKETS We generally serve three end-markets: hospitals and healthcare providers, medical device manufacturers and home care. These markets are affected by a number of factors, including demographics, utilization and reimbursement patterns. The following charts depict the percentage of net revenues for the years ended December\u00a031, 2022, 2021 and 2020 derived from each of our end markets:  GOVERNMENT REGULATION We are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the U.S. relating to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products. Regulation of Medical Devices in the U.S. All of our medical devices manufactured or distributed in the U.S. are subject to requirements set forth by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDC Act\u201d) and regulations promulgated by the FDA under the FDC Act, which are enforced by the FDA. The FDA and, in some cases, other government agencies administer requirements for the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, servicing, marketing, importing and exporting of all finished devices intended for human use. Additional FDA requirements include premarket clearance and approval, advertising and promotion, distribution and post-market surveillance of our medical devices and establishment of registration and device listing for our facilities. Unless an exemption, pre-amendment grandfather status (that is, medical devices legally marketed in the U.S. before May 28, 1976) or FDA enforcement discretion applies, each medical device that we market in the U.S. must first receive either clearance as a Class I or, typically, a Class II device (after submitting a premarket notification (\u201c510(k)\u201d) or approval as a Class III device (after filing a premarket approval application (\u201cPMA\u201d)) from the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must demonstrate to the FDA that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device (a 510(k)-cleared device, a pre-amendment device for which FDA has not called for PMAs or a device with a de novo authorization), referred to as the \"predicate device.\" Substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.\u00a0The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process requires regulatory competence to execute and usually takes four to nine months, but it can last longer. A device that is not eligible for the 510(k) process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed by the FDA through the de novo process (the process for granting marketing authorization when no substantially equivalent device exists) if the FDA agrees it is a low to moderate risk device. A device that is not exempt from premarket review and is not eligible for 510(k) clearance or de novo authorization is categorized as Class III and must follow the PMA approval pathway, which requires proof of  7 7 7   the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction.\u00a0The process of obtaining PMA approval also requires specific regulatory competence and is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) or de novo processes. The PMA process generally takes from one to three years or even longer. Our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of Class I (510(k) exempt) and Class II devices that require 510(k) clearance, although a few are 510(k)-exempt.\u00a0In addition, certain modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA or PMA supplement. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will be obtained in a timely matter if at all for any device that we propose to market. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance or a de novo authorization.\u00a0The sponsor of a clinical trial must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations, including FDA\u2019s requirements for investigational device exemptions (\u201cIDE\u201d) requirements and good clinical practice (\u201cGCP\u201d).\u00a0Clinical trials must also be approved, and are subject to continuing oversight, by an institutional review board (\"IRB\"), which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications to, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human research subjects.\u00a0The FDA may order the temporary or permanent hold or discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects.\u00a0An IRB may also require the clinical trial to be halted at a given clinical trial site for failure to comply with the IRB\u2019s requirements or to adequately ensure the protection of human subjects, or may impose other conditions. Conducting medical device clinical trials is a complex and costly activity and frequently requires the use of outsourced resources that specialize in planning, conducting and/or monitoring the clinical trial for the medical device manufacturer. A device placed on the market must comply with numerous regulatory requirements. Those regulatory requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: \u2022device listing and establishment registration; \u2022adherence to the Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d), which requires stringent design, testing, control, documentation, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures; \u2022labeling, including advertising and promotion, requirements; \u2022prohibitions against the promotion of off-label uses or indications; \u2022adverse event and malfunction reporting (Medical Device Reports or \"MDRs\"); \u2022post-approval restrictions or conditions, potentially including post-approval clinical trials or other required testing; \u2022post-market surveillance requirements; \u2022the FDA\u2019s recall authority, whereby it can require or request the recall of products from the market; and \u2022reporting and documentation of voluntary corrections or removals. The FDA has issued final regulations regarding the Unique Device Identification (\u201cUDI\u201d) System, which requires manufacturers to label or mark certain medical devices and/or their packaging with unique identifiers. Although the FDA expects that the UDI System will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety, it has required us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling.\u00a0The UDI System was implemented in stages based on device risk, with the first requirements having taken effect in September 2014 and the last in December 2022. Certain of our medical devices are sold in kits that include a drug component, such as lidocaine. These types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (\"CDRH\") under the device regulations because the device provides the primary mode of action of the kit. Although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device, it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMPs\u201d) and adverse drug experience reporting requirements, to the extent applicable to the drug-component repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cGMPs as well as other regulatory requirements. Our manufacturing facilities, as well as those of certain of our suppliers, are subject to periodic and for-cause inspections by FDA personnel to verify compliance with the QSR (21 CFR Part 820) as well as other regulatory requirements. Similar inspections and audits are performed by Notified Bodies to verify compliance to applicable  8 8 8   ISO standards (e.g. ISO 13485:2016), by auditing organizations under the Medical Device Single Audit Program (\"MDSAP\") applicable to regulatory requirements of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and the U.S., and/or by regulatory authorities to verify compliance with medical device regulations and requirements from the countries in which we distribute product. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, civil penalties, consent decrees, injunctions, criminal prosecution, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusal to permit importation or exportation, refusal to grant, or delays in granting, clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals. The FDA also has the authority under certain circumstances to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us.\u00a0Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business.  Regulation of Medical Devices Outside of the U.S. Medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the U.S. in which we do business. These laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing, as well as monitoring of device-related adverse events, are components of most of these regulatory systems. Manufacturing certification requirements and audits through the MDSAP program or other regulatory authority inspections also apply. In addition, the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the \u201cEU MDR\u201d), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices (as compared to the predecessor Medical Device Directive (the \"EU MDD\")), including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems, economic operators and post-market surveillance. The EU MDR went into effect in May 2021. As of the effective date, new and modified devices must be certified under, and be compliant with, the EU MDR. Devices that previously satisfied EU MDD requirements can continue to be marketed in the EU, subject to certain limitations, until the expiration of their current EU MDD certifications, which may be no later than May 2024, but certain EU MDR requirements went into effect for such devices in May 2021. In February 2023, the European Parliament and Council approved an amendment to extend the EU MDR certification deadline for currently marketed devices past May 2024, with December 2027 as the new deadline for highest-risk devices and December 2028 for lower-risk devices.  Failure to obtain EU MDR certifications prior to the expiration of existing EU MDD certifications may limit our ability to sell certain products in the EU until EU MDR certification is obtained. Failure to meet the applicable EU MDR requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. Healthcare Laws We are subject to various federal, state and local laws in the U.S. targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.\u00a0These laws prohibit us from, among other things, soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs. Violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.\u00a0In addition, we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the U.S. that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally or state funded programs.\u00a0Certain marketing practices, such as off-label promotion, and violations of federal anti-kickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws. In addition, we are subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry.\u00a0Rules issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is available to the public on the CMS website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.\u00a0In addition, several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states.\u00a0Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities.\u00a0The federal government and certain other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance and/or reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations. 9 9 9   Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), imposed regulatory mandates and other measures designed to contain the cost of healthcare, in addition to annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals. Violations of these laws are punishable by a range of fines, penalties and other sanctions. Other Regulatory Requirements We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the U.S. that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with government entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In the sale, delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the U.S., we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those administered by the Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and/or with certain individuals identified by the U.S. government. Despite our global trade and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, distributors or other agents. Violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and imprisonment. COMPETITION The medical device industry is highly competitive. We compete with many companies, ranging from small start-up enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources. Furthermore, extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete. We must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product reliability, performance, customer and sales support, and cost-effectiveness.  SALES AND MARKETING Our product sales are made directly to hospitals, healthcare providers, distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces, independent representatives and independent distributor networks. BACKLOG Most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks, with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers. Therefore, our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12-month period. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS We own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks. We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods based upon the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks. All product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries. Although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future, we do not consider any single patent or trademark, except for the Teleflex name and the Arrow and UroLift brands, to be essential to the operation of our business. SUPPLIERS AND MATERIALS Materials used in the manufacture and sterilization of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used, the components supplied and the sterilization services provided for our overall operations. Most  10 10 10   of the materials, components and sterilization services we utilize are available from multiple sources, and where practical, we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. However, our ability to establish alternate sources of supply of materials and sterilization services may be delayed due to FDA and other regulatory authority requirements regarding the manufacture and sterilization of our products. Volatility in commodity prices, and freight costs, can have a significant impact on the cost of producing and supplying certain of our products. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT We are engaged in both internal and external research and development. Our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide innovative new, safe and effective products that enhance clinical value by reducing infections, improving patient and clinician safety, enhancing patient outcomes and enabling less invasive procedures.  We also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers. SEASONALITY Portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Incidence of flu and other disease patterns and, to a lesser extent, the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to single-use products.\u00a0Historically, we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors. HUMAN CAPITAL As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 15,500 employees, including 4,000 employees in the U.S. and 11,500 employees in 32 other countries around the world. Our global supply chain employees make up 58% of the total employee population and are located primarily in Mexico, Malaysia and the Czech Republic. Our commercial organization comprises 24% of the global employee base. The remaining 18% of employees work in various corporate functions, based in each of our locations.  We believe our employees are a significant differentiating factor and play a critical role in our ability to deliver on our commitments to patients and execute our strategy to our customers and shareholders. Our management team places significant focus and attention to matters affecting our people, particularly our commitment to our Core Values, capability development, total rewards and diversity, as well as how each employee experiences our culture.  Culture The culture of our organization is critical to the human capital we attract, develop and retain and who, in turn, contribute to the results and success of our organization. Our culture is framed by our Core Values \u2013 building trust, entrepreneurial spirit and making our workplace fun, with people at the center of all we do. We strive to develop and sustain our culture by embedding these values in all aspects of our organization, including our human capital strategies.  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion At Teleflex, our Core Values define our company, shape our culture, guide our business practices, and direct the way we interact with our stakeholders. Rooted in our Core Values, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) plays an essential role in fulfilling our company core purpose to improve the health and quality of peoples\u2019 lives. Through embedding the principles of DEI into our activities, decisions, governance, innovations, and culture, we contribute to the achievement of accessible, equitable and sustainable healthcare for all.   DEI initiatives in Teleflex are supported by our Global DEI Council, composed of senior leadership from across the organization, and our four Regional DEI Councils in each the US & Canada, LATAM, EMEA, and APAC. The Regional DEI Councils are representative of employees from all levels, functions, and regions, acting as a guiding hub of perspectives and experiences to enrich the importance of DEI in Teleflex.  Within our Regional DEI Councils, each of our Employee Resources Groups (ERGs) are represented by a member of their leadership committee to share the progress, knowledge, and initiatives from their respective ERG. Our ERG footprint extends to each of our four regions, providing our people with employee-driven communities that focus on initiatives such as supporting working parents & caregivers, coordinating mentorship and development opportunities, promoting cultural awareness and understanding, and connecting employees with shared experiences, interests or backgrounds.   11 11 11   We continue our efforts to cultivate a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we work and serve. These efforts are supported through engaging and partnering with local organizations, educational institutions and recruiting firms for a variety of opportunities in Teleflex including vacancies, co-op placements and internships. In partnering with local organizations, we are better able to address how we can best serve and support marginalized populations in our communities.  We collect and regularly review several measures of the diversity within our global workforce. Some illustrative and notable highlights of our new hires from the January to December 2022 period are as follows: \u2022At 58%, females made up the majority of our new hires globally; \u2022Of the 5,654 total global hires, 51% were aged 20-29, followed by 24% aged 30-39 and 12% aged 40-49; and \u2022In the US, approximately 50% of our new hires represented minority ethnicities including Black (23%), Asian (13%), and Hispanic (10%) Talent Management, Development and Learning  We are committed to providing our employees with opportunities for growth, development, and career advancement and to building a high-performance culture that supports our Core Values throughout the employee lifecycle. We have implemented a talent management process that provides regular coaching check-ins between employees and their managers to review the employee\u2019s developmental objectives and career progression. We also regularly review our talent portfolio and succession plans to ensure we can deliver on our company strategy. In addition, we offer a number of internal educational and training resources to employees throughout our organization. Among these resources is the Teleflex Academy, a curriculum that provides learning opportunities for our employees to further develop their skills and receive training across broad subject areas such as leadership; communications; diversity, equity, and inclusion; sales; customer service; and business acumen.  Total Rewards Our commitment to our employees is to provide fair, equitable and competitive compensation and benefits packages to all employees globally, regardless of gender, age or ethnicity.  To that end we continuously review and calibrate employee roles and responsibilities to ensure we are offering equal pay for equal work, and we actively manage our global compensation and benefit programs to ensure we can attract and retain the critical human capital we need to continue to deliver on our commitments to employees, customers, patients and shareholders. We believe our compensation and benefits offering is aligned to competitive market pay levels and, along with our culture and Core Values, acts to incentivize the right behaviors and actions to achieve the best results for the organization. We structure our compensation to include a mix of pay components of base salary, short-term cash incentives and long-term incentives. We offer employees health, welfare and retirement benefits and have implemented policies addressing paid time off, flexible work schedules, employee assistance, parental leave and family benefits, among others.  In 2021, we performed an in-depth pay equity analysis on the pay practices within our organization. As part of that analysis on our compensation programs, no systemic gender bias was identified globally and within the United States, no systemic ethnicity bias was identified. We continue to explore where we can expand our pay equity analyses for every jurisdiction in which we operate. We are committed to conducting pay equity analyses on a regular, periodic basis to ensure we continue to align to our commitments and Core Values.  Environmental, Health and Safety Our Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) vision is to protect the safety and health of Teleflex personnel and the environments in which we operate. We have a vested interest in protecting our most valuable assets \u2013 our employees. Everyone is a steward of EHS, fostering a culture of being actively responsible in all our operations. We remain fully committed to complying with all relevant EHS legislation and to achieving our vision. We have and will continue to expend resources to construct, maintain, operate, and improve our facilities across the globe for environmental, health, safety and sustainability of our operations. For example, in response to the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have expended resources to implement various safety measures, including implementing social distancing protocols and expanding personal protective equipment availability and usage, across our facilities globally in an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees and others. Further, we understand that our environment is both complex and delicate, and we prioritize managing and limiting the impact our business has on the environment as part of our Zero Harm Culture. As we continue to review our commitments to environmental sustainability, we have initiated programs to track and lower our consumption of energy, water and gas as well as reduce waste and the use of hazardous materials. In addition, we have developed an EHS program  12 12 12   focused in the areas of training our personnel with respect to, deploying and auditing global EHS standards as well as other programs to engage our employees on EHS initiatives. ENVIRONMENTAL We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Our operations, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While we continue to devote resources to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those related to climate change, will not exceed our estimates or will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.
