Incorporated herein by reference is certain financial information about our segment and geographic areas contained in Note 18 \u2013 Segment and Geographic Information in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report.  Recent Developments In May 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Putnam Investments from Great-West Lifeco., Inc. (\u201cGreat-West\u201d), a member of the Power Corporation group of companies. The Power Corporation group of companies including Great-West are leaders in the global insurance, retirement, asset management and wealth management sectors. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.  Company History  Since 1947, the Company and its predecessors have been engaged in the investment management and related services business. Franklin was incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 1969, and originated our mutual fund business with the initial Franklin family of funds, known for its fixed income funds and growth and value-oriented equity funds. Over the years, we have expanded and developed our business to meet evolving investor needs, in part, by acquiring companies engaged in investment management and related services. We have added, among others: (i)\u00a0the Templeton global investment firm in 1992, (ii)\u00a0the Franklin Mutual Series investment firm in 1996, (iii)\u00a0the Franklin Bissett Canadian investment firm in 2000, (iv)\u00a0the Fiduciary Trust International investment and trust services firm in 2001, (v)\u00a0the Benefit Street Partners alternative credit management firm in 2019, (vi)\u00a0the Athena Capital Advisors investment and wealth management firm in March 2020, (vii)\u00a0The Pennsylvania Trust Company investment and trust services firm in May 2020, (viii)\u00a0the Legg Mason global investment firm in July\u00a02020, (ix) the O\u2019Shaughnessy Asset Management quantitative asset management firm in December 2021, (x) the Lexington Partners global alternatives investment firm in April 2022, and (xi) the Alcentra alternative credit investment firm in November 2022.  OUR BUSINESS STRUCTURE Through our subsidiaries, we are committed to helping investors navigate global markets, as well as continuing to evolve and build on our strengths to meet the needs of our clients. We generally derive our revenues and income from providing investment management and related services to our products and the products we sub-advise. Our investment management fees, which represent a majority of our revenues, depend to a large extent on the level and relative mix of our AUM and the types of services provided, which are subject to change. 4 4  4 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Our business is conducted through our subsidiaries, including our specialist investment managers. Our specialist investment managers include subsidiaries registered with the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \u201cAdvisers Act\u201d), as well as subsidiaries registered as investment adviser equivalents in jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Ireland, India, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Switzerland, South Korea, Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d).  Our AUM by Asset Class and Product Type We offer a broad product mix under our fixed income, equity, alternative, multi-asset and cash management asset classes. Our fixed income capabilities include government, municipals, corporate credit, bank loans, securitized, multi-sector, and other investments. Our equity capabilities include value, deep value, core value, blend, growth and growth at a reasonable price, convertibles, sector, Shariah, smart beta and thematic investments. Our alternative capabilities include private debt, hedge funds, private equity, real estate and infrastructure investments. Our multi-asset capabilities include income, real return, balanced/hybrid, total return, target data/risk, absolute return, tactical asset allocation and managed volatility investments.  We believe, despite market risks, that we have a competitive advantage as a result of the economic and geographic diversity of our products available to our clients. Our U.S. funds include U.S. mutual funds, closed-end funds, ETFs and other products. Our non-U.S. funds include a variety of cross-border funds principally domiciled in Luxembourg or Ireland, registered for sale to non-U.S. investors in certain other countries, and international locally domiciled funds and products for the particular local market. Our institutional separate account services are provided to various institutions for which we serve as an investment adviser. Our retail separately managed accounts, commonly known as managed accounts or wrap programs, are sponsored by various financial institutions. We also offer and serve as investment adviser to various other products. Our fees for providing investment management services are generally based on a percentage of AUM in the accounts that we advise, the asset classes of the accounts, and the types of services that we provide. AUM by asset class and product type was as follows: (in billions)  as of September 30, 2023U.S. FundsNon-U.S. FundsInstitutional Separate AccountsRetail Separately Managed AccountsOtherTotalPercentageof TotalAUMFixed Income$134.5\u00a0$34.0\u00a0$225.4\u00a0$31.9\u00a0$57.3\u00a0$483.1\u00a035\u00a0%Equity207.4\u00a074.9\u00a036.8\u00a072.7\u00a038.6\u00a0430.4\u00a031\u00a0%Alternative5.3\u00a04.3\u00a029.5\u00a00.2\u00a0215.6\u00a0254.9\u00a019\u00a0%Multi-Asset86.4\u00a09.3\u00a04.8\u00a08.0\u00a036.5\u00a0145.0\u00a011\u00a0%Cash Management34.5\u00a025.5\u00a00.8\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a060.8\u00a04\u00a0%Total$468.1\u00a0$148.0\u00a0$297.3\u00a0$112.8\u00a0$348.0\u00a0$1,374.2\u00a0100\u00a0% (in billions)   as of September 30, 2023 Cash Management See \u201cAssets under Management\u201d under Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report for additional information about our AUM. Broadly speaking, other than AUM changes due to acquisitions, changes in our AUM depend primarily upon two factors: (i)\u00a0the increase or decrease in the market value of the securities and instruments held in the portfolio of investments, and (ii)\u00a0the level and direction of net flows. Changing market conditions and the evolving needs of our clients may cause asset volatility and a shift in our asset mix, potentially resulting in an increase or decrease in our revenues and income depending upon the nature of our AUM and the level of management fees we earn based on our AUM.  Our Investment Management Related Services and Products Our specialist investment managers offer diverse perspectives and specialized expertise across asset classes and strategies. Across our business, our specialist investment managers generally focus on a portion of the asset management industry in terms of the types of assets managed and each may differ in the types of products and services offered, the investment styles utilized, and the types and geographic locations of its clients. Each typically markets its products and  5 5  5 Table of Contents Table of Contents  services under its own brand name, with certain distribution functions provided by our corporate distribution subsidiaries where applicable. We have in place revenue sharing arrangements with certain of our specialist investment managers.  Our specialist investment managers include: Benefit Street Partners, Brandywine Global, Clarion Partners, ClearBridge Investments, Fiduciary Trust International, Franklin Equity Group, Franklin Income Investors, Franklin Mutual Series, Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, Franklin Templeton Global Private Equity, Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, K2 Advisors, Lexington Partners, Martin Currie, O\u2019Shaughnessy Asset Management, Royce Investment Partners, Templeton Global Equity Group, Templeton Global Macro and Western Asset Management.  Through our specialist investment managers, our investment products are offered globally to retail, institutional and high-net-worth clients, which may include, among others, individual investors, institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, defined benefit and contribution plans, endowments and charitable foundations, healthcare systems and insurance companies. Our investment products include mutual funds, closed-end funds, private funds, institutional separate accounts, retail separately managed accounts, and other products. Our products and capabilities are designed to accommodate a variety of investment goals and preferences, from capital appreciation to capital preservation, as well as sustainable investing and other environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) preferences.  We are committed to partnering closely with our clients to understand their challenges and aspirations, and drawing on our investment capabilities and resources to offer and/or design the right investment solutions for them. We distribute and market globally our different capabilities under our brand names through various subsidiaries and multiple points of access, including directly to investors and through financial intermediaries. We primarily engage new institutional business through our relationships with pension, defined contribution and management consultants, direct sales efforts and additional mandates from our existing client relationships, as well as from our responses to requests for proposals. We also market and distribute our products through various subsidiaries to institutional investors with separate accounts. Our services also include management of our ETF platforms. Our specialist investment managers provide investment management services pursuant to agreements with each of our investment products and/or clients, including products for which we provide sub-advisory services. Investment management fees are generally determined as a percentage of AUM pursuant to such contractual arrangements. Our investment management services include services to accounts for which we have full investment discretion and to accounts for which we have no investment discretion. Our services include fundamental investment research and valuation analyses, including original economic, political, industry and company research, and analyses of suppliers, customers and competitors. Our management fees vary with the types of services that we provide, and fees may at times be waived or voluntarily reduced by the parties, among other things.  Our Funds Our investment managers manage a fund\u2019s portfolio of securities in accordance with the fund\u2019s stated objectives. To support the funds\u2019 operations, our subsidiaries either provide or arrange for the investment and other management, shareholder servicing and administrative services required by the funds. We outsource various administration, technology, transfer agency and other services for our funds to third-party providers. An investor may purchase shares of a mutual fund directly from us or through a broker-dealer, financial adviser, bank or other similar financial intermediary that provides investment advice to the investor, or an investor may purchase shares of a closed-end fund or ETF on the stock exchange where the fund is traded. Financial intermediaries may earn fees and commissions and receive other compensation with respect to fund shares sold to investors. The applicable board of directors or trustees of our funds and our management personnel periodically review the investment management fee structures for the funds in light of fund performance, the level and range of services provided, industry conditions and other relevant factors. For our U.S. mutual funds, most of our investment management agreements between our subsidiaries and funds must be renewed each year, and must be approved annually by a vote of each fund\u2019s board of directors or trustees as a whole and separately by a majority of the independent fund directors or trustees under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), or by a vote of the holders of a majority of the fund\u2019s outstanding voting securities, and such agreements generally may be terminated by either party without penalty after prior written notice. Our non-U.S. mutual funds, private funds, institutional and high-net-worth separate accounts, and the products for which we provide sub-advisory services, are typically subject to various termination rights and/or renewal provisions, which often provide for termination upon relatively short notice with little or no penalty. 6 6  6 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Retail Separately Managed Account Programs  Certain of our specialist investment managers provide asset management services to retail separately managed account programs sponsored by various financial institutions. These programs typically allow securities brokers or other financial intermediaries to offer their clients the opportunity to choose from a number of asset management services pursuing different investment strategies provided by one or more investment managers, and generally charge an all-inclusive fee that can cover asset management, asset allocation and custodial and administrative services. Alternative Products and Strategies Certain of our specialist investment managers manage alternative products and investment strategies which provide our clients with alternatives to traditional equity and fixed income products and services. Our alternative products include private credit funds and structured products, business development companies, hedge funds (funds of funds and custom advisory solutions), private equity funds, secondary funds, venture capital funds and real estate funds. These products employ various investment strategies and approaches, including\u00a0loan origination, collateralized loan obligations, high-yield credit, hedge fund advisory,\u00a0private equity and infrastructure transactions in emerging markets,\u00a0global macro,\u00a0consumer loans,\u00a0direct real estate investments, and custom-tailored investment programs. High-Net-Worth Investment Management, Trust and Custody Services Through our Fiduciary Trust International related subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to, among others, high-net-worth individuals and families, family offices, foundations and institutional clients. Fiduciary Trust International offers investment management and advisory services across different investment styles and asset classes. The majority of these client assets are actively managed by individual portfolio managers, while a significant number of clients also seek multi-manager, multi-asset class solutions. We also may provide separately managed accounts, private funds, and trust, custody and related services, including administration, performance measurement, estate planning and tax planning. Sales and Distribution  Our global distribution framework is organized into two groups. Our global advisory services group is responsible for sales, marketing and business development and maintains a regional distribution model, with regional teams responsible for driving initiatives in collaboration with global teams. Our global alliances and new business strategies group oversees our digital wealth management and distribution-related technology, joint ventures, product governance, seed capital allocations, fund board management, and direct-to-consumer initiatives. Our groups work together to meet the needs of our advisors, clients and investors. There are many sales channels across each region, which may include retail, institutional, private wealth, retirement, insurance, and other specialty sales. Our global footprint and breadth of investment capability provides the opportunity for us to work with global financial institutions to add value through and beyond investing, including by building business relationships and global economic partnerships. In addition, certain of our specialist investment managers have their own sales and marketing teams that distribute their products and services, primarily to institutional investors, both directly and through consultants. Consultants play a large role in institutional investment management by helping clients select and retain investment managers. Institutional investment management clients and their consultants tend to be highly sophisticated and investment performance-driven. Our sales and distribution capabilities and related efforts are critical components of our business and may be impacted by global distribution trends and changes within the financial services industry. In the U.S., our distribution subsidiaries generally serve as the principal underwriters and distributors of shares of most of our mutual funds. Outside the U.S., certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries provide sales, distribution and marketing services to our non-U.S. mutual funds. Some of our non-U.S. mutual funds, particularly our Luxembourg and Irish domiciled funds, are distributed globally on a cross-border basis, while others are distributed exclusively in local markets.  We earn sales and distribution fees primarily by distributing our mutual funds pursuant to distribution agreements with the funds. Under our distribution agreements with our U.S. mutual funds, we offer and sell the fund shares on a continuous basis and pay certain costs associated with selling, marketing and distributing the fund shares, including the costs of developing and producing sales literature, shareholder reports and prospectuses. Our sales and distribution fees primarily consist of upfront sales commissions and ongoing distribution fees, which generally will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different asset classes and types of investors. 7 7  7 Table of Contents Table of Contents  The majority of our U.S. mutual funds, with the exception of certain money market funds and certain other funds specifically designed for purchase through separately managed account programs, have adopted distribution plans under Rule 12b-1 (the \u201cRule 12b-1 Plans\u201d) promulgated under the Investment Company Act. The Rule\u00a012b-1 Plans permit the funds to pay us for marketing, marketing support, advertising, printing and sales promotion services relating to the distribution of their shares, subject to the Rule 12b-1 Plans\u2019 limitations on amounts based on daily average AUM. Similar arrangements exist for the distribution of non-U.S. mutual funds. The Rule 12b-1 Plans are established for one-year terms and must be approved annually by a vote of each fund\u2019s board of directors or trustees as a whole and separately by a majority of the independent fund directors or trustees under the Investment Company Act, and such plans are subject to termination at any time by a majority vote of the independent fund directors or trustees or by the fund\u2019s shareholders. We pay the sales and distribution fees earned as revenues to the financial advisers and other intermediaries that sell our funds on our behalf. The distribution agreements with our U.S. mutual funds generally provide for us to pay commission expenses for sales of fund shares to qualifying broker-dealers and other independent financial intermediaries. These financial intermediaries receive various sales commissions and other fees for services in matching investors with funds whose asset classes match such investors\u2019 goals and risk profiles. The intermediaries also may receive fees for their assistance in explaining the operations of the funds, and for reporting and various other distribution services. Other compensation may be offered to the extent not prohibited by federal or state laws or any self-regulatory agency, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), applicable to our business. We are heavily dependent upon these third-party distribution and sales channels and business relationships. There is increasing competition for access to these channels, which has caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future as competition continues and service expectations increase. Similar arrangements exist with the distribution of our non-U.S. mutual funds where, generally, our subsidiary that distributes the funds receives maintenance fees from the funds and pays certain fees to financial advisers, banks and other intermediaries.  Shareholder Servicing  We perform our shareholder servicing services directly or through third parties. Substantially all shareholder servicing fees are earned from our funds for providing transfer agency services, which include providing shareholder statements, transaction processing, client service and tax reporting. Fees for U.S. funds are based on the level of AUM and applicable transactions in shareholder accounts, while outside of the U.S., the fees are based on the level of AUM and/or the number of shareholder accounts. We outsource various transfer agency and other services for our funds to third-party providers who serve as a sub-agent or delegate, depending on the jurisdiction.  COMPETITION  The financial services industry is a highly competitive global industry. Competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, product mix and offerings, service quality and innovation, distribution relationships, and fees charged. We face strong competition from numerous investment management companies, securities brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions, which offer a wide range of financial and investment management services and products to the same retail, institutional and high-net-worth investors and accounts that we are seeking to attract. We offer a broad product mix that meets a variety of investment goals and needs for different investors, and we may periodically introduce new products to provide investors with additional investment options.  We primarily derive our fund sales through third-party broker-dealers, banks, investment advisers and other financial intermediaries. Because we rely on third-party distribution and sales channels to sell our products, we do not control the ultimate investment recommendations given by them to clients. Such financial intermediaries may recommend competing products. Due to our international presence and varied product mix, it is difficult to assess our market position relative to other investment managers on a worldwide basis, but we believe that we are one of the more widely diversified investment managers based in the U.S. We believe that our fixed income, equity, alternative and multi-asset asset mix, coupled with our global presence, will serve our competitive needs well over the long term. We continue to focus on the long-term performance of our investment products, service to clients and extensive marketing activities through our strong broker-dealer and other financial institution distribution network as well as with high-net-worth and institutional clients.  The establishment of new investment management firms and continuous development of investment products  8 8  8 Table of Contents Table of Contents  increases the competition that we face. Many of our competitors have long-standing and established relationships with broker-dealers, investment advisers and their clients, and some have affiliated brokerage businesses. Others have focused on, offer and market specific product lines that provide strong competition to certain of our asset classes. In addition, consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors, some with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own.  REGULATION  General We are subject to extensive regulation. Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various U.S. federal and state, and/or international regulation and supervision. Our regulators have broad authority with respect to the regulation of investment management and other financial services, including among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations, impose net capital and other financial or operational requirements on us, and other enforcement powers described below. The regulations to which we are subject continue to change and evolve over time. Consequently, there is uncertainty associated with the regulatory environments in which we operate. The rules and regulations applicable to investment management organizations are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature and does not purport to be complete. With our global operations, certain of our subsidiaries are registered with or licensed by various U.S. and/or non-U.S. regulators, and our funds are subject to various U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws. In particular, we are subject to various securities, compliance, corporate governance, disclosure, privacy, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing, and economic, trade and sanctions laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, as well as to various cross-border rules and regulations, such as the anti-bribery and anti-corruption rules under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the data protection rules under the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). We are subject to sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury (\u201cUSDT\u201d), as well as sanctions programs adopted and administered by non-U.S. jurisdictions where our services and products are offered. Our subsidiaries with custody of client assets or accounts are also subject to the applicable laws and regulations of U.S. states and other non-U.S. jurisdictions regarding the reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property. We also must comply with complex and changing tax regimes in the jurisdictions where we operate our business. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. and non-U.S. laws, regulations, rules, codes, notices, directives, guidelines, orders, circulars and/or conditions in the various jurisdictions where we operate could result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against us, our subsidiaries and/or our business. Breaches of applicable laws and rules could result in regulatory enforcement, civil liability, criminal liability and/or the imposition of a range of sanctions or orders against us, including, as applicable, monetary damages, injunctions, disgorgements, fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, censures, reprimands, and the revocation, cancellation, suspension or restriction of licenses, registration status or approvals held by us or our business in a jurisdiction or market. In addition, a public regulatory issue can have a negative impact on our reputation, and as a result have indirect impacts on our business or growth. See Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report, for financial information about our business. U.S. Regulation U.S. Regulatory Framework. As a U.S. reporting company, we are subject to U.S. federal securities laws, state securities and corporate laws, state escheatment laws and regulations, and the rules and regulations of certain U.S. regulatory and self-regulatory organizations, such as the SEC and the NYSE. In particular, we are subject to various securities, compliance, corporate governance and disclosure rules adopted by the SEC. We are also subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws, including those affecting corporate governance and disclosure, such as the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. As a NYSE-listed company, we are also subject to NYSE listing and disclosure requirements. 9 9  9 Table of Contents Table of Contents  As a global investment management organization, certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to the rules and regulations of various U.S. regulatory and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, FINRA, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d), the National Futures Association, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the U.S. Department of Labor, and the USDT. Our non-U.S. operations also may be subject to regulation by U.S. regulators, including the SEC, the CFTC and the DOJ (for example with respect to the FCPA). Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and/or the CFTC, and many of our funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. These registrations, licenses and authorizations impose numerous obligations, as well as detailed operational requirements, on such subsidiaries and funds. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on our registered investment adviser subsidiaries, including record keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions against fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes similar obligations on the registered investment companies advised by our subsidiaries. U.S. Regulatory Reforms. Over the years, the U.S. federal corporate governance and securities laws have been augmented substantially and made significantly more complex by various legislation. As we continue to address our legal and regulatory requirements or focus on meeting new or expanded requirements, we may need to expend a substantial amount of additional time, costs and resources. Regulatory reforms may continue to add further complexity to our business and operations and could require us to alter our investment management services and related activities, which could be costly, impede our growth and adversely impact our AUM, revenues and income. Such reforms could significantly increase our reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations. Certain key regulatory reforms in the U.S. that impact or relate to our business, and may cause, or continue to cause, us to incur additional obligations, include:  Executive Compensation Clawback Rules. In October 2023, we adopted an executive compensation clawback policy in order to comply with new Section 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act, and the listing standards of the NYSE, providing for the repayment or forfeiture of certain excess compensation following an applicable accounting restatement from persons who served as an executive officer of Franklin at any time during the performance period for such incentive-based compensation and who received such compensation during the three fiscal years preceding the date on which Franklin is required to prepare an accounting restatement. A copy of the policy is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report.  Issuer Share Repurchase Plan Disclosure. In May 2023, the SEC adopted final rules requiring additional disclosure of issuer share repurchases, requiring expanded quarterly reporting in tabular format of detailed information regarding share repurchases made by or on behalf of an issuer during the quarter as well as narrative disclosure regarding issuer share repurchase programs and policies. The rules also require new quarterly disclosure of whether a U.S. issuer has adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan during the quarter, similar to the required disclosure of the adoption and termination of such plans by an issuer\u2019s directors and officers. We will become subject to the new quarterly issuer disclosure requirements in our quarterly report for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023.  Cybersecurity Disclosure. In July 2023, the SEC adopted amendments to its rules to require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and incident reporting by public companies. The SEC\u2019s adopted amendments require public companies to (i) disclose, on a current basis, any cybersecurity incident it deems to be material within four business days on a Form 8-K; (ii) describe, on a periodic basis, the company\u2019s processes, if any, for the assessment, identification and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats, as well as whether any risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect their business strategy, results of operations or financial condition; and (iii) describe, on a periodic basis, the board\u2019s oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management\u2019s role in assessing and managing those risks. The amendments will require ongoing evaluation and analysis of possible changes in our applicable processes and procedures, including regarding cyber incident response plans and procedures, disclosure analysis framework, risk management processes, and board oversight structure. The current disclosure reporting requirements become effective in December 2023, and we will become subject to the annual disclosure requirements in our annual report for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. Sustainable Investing and ESG, and Climate-Related Disclosure. Sustainable investing and ESG continue to be the focus of increased regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions. In the U.S., the SEC has proposed climate disclosure rules to require public issuers to include enhanced disclosure regarding corporate climate-related information in their periodic reports and registration statements. Such information would include climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on an issuer\u2019s business or results of operations, as well as certain climate-related financial statement metrics. In addition, we expect state laws and regulations regarding these topics to continue to evolve and impose new and additional requirements. For example, in October 2023, California enacted a new climate accountability package pursuant to its new Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act that will require annual disclosure of certain greenhouse gas  10 10  10 Table of Contents Table of Contents  emissions and new Climate-Related Financial Risk Act that will require biennial disclosure of certain climate-related financial risks and mitigation measures, each beginning in 2026, subject to applicable implementing regulations and rulemaking that may impact final scope and compliance timing. Also, the SEC has increased its focus on disclosure and compliance related to ESG strategies of investment advisers and funds. Globally, the International Sustainability Standards Board and applicable sustainability disclosure standards impact how national regulators and governance bodies approach these and related topics. Privacy and Data Protection. There continues to be an increased regulatory and enforcement focus with respect to the protection of individuals\u2019 privacy and personal data around the world, and the ongoing need to secure and ensure only appropriate collection and use of sensitive customer, personnel, and others\u2019 personal data. A majority of the jurisdictions where we operate are covered, or we expect will be covered, by stringent privacy and data protection laws and regulations. As the regulatory focus on privacy continues to intensify and laws and regulations concerning the management of personal data continue to expand, risks related to the handling of privacy obligations and personal data collection across our business will increase. For example, in addition to international data protection and privacy laws and regulations like the EU\u2019s GDPR, we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to and affected by existing, new and evolving country, federal and state laws, regulations and guidance around the world impacting consumer and personnel privacy, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and various other U.S. state consumer privacy laws that provide for enhanced consumer protections for their residents and impose requirements for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information of their residents. Systemically Important Financial Institutions. The mandate of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) is to identify and respond to threats to U.S. financial stability. Similarly, the U.S. and other members of the G-20 group of nations have empowered the Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d) to identify and respond, in a coordinated manner, to threats to global financial stability. The FSOC may designate certain non-bank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions (\u201cSIFIs\u201d), which are subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The FSB may designate certain non-bank financial companies as global systemically important financial institutions (\u201cG-SIFIs\u201d). To the extent that we or any of our funds are designated as a SIFI or G-SIFI, such designations would add additional supervision, review, monitoring and/or regulation resulting in increased scrutiny and oversight that could impact our business. Derivatives and Other Financial Products. Regulators continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives, which could result in further restrictions and limitations on the use of such products. In October 2020, the SEC adopted new rules governing the use of derivatives by certain registered investment companies, including certain mutual funds, designed to address investor protection concerns, which became effective in August 2022. Key aspects of the new framework include, among other things, value at risk limits on a fund entering into derivatives transactions, required risk management program, and further fund board oversight, reporting and compliance requirements. The EU and other countries have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of adopting or implementing, similar and additional requirements. There is the risk that full mutual recognition may not be achieved between the various regulators, which may cause us to incur duplicate regulation and transaction costs. Private Fund Adviser Reforms. In May 2023, the SEC adopted amendments to Form PF, which is the confidential reporting form that investment advisers to private funds file to provide confidential information to the SEC and the FSOC. The amendments were adopted largely as proposed and will require (i) current and quarterly reporting by large hedge fund advisers regarding certain events that may indicate stress at a fund or signal broader systemic risk; and (ii) enhanced reporting by large private equity advisers to allow the FSOC to monitor systemic risk. The amendments also will require large private equity fund advisers to report information on general partner and limited partner clawbacks on an annual basis as well as additional information on their strategies and borrowings as a part of their annual filing. The current and quarterly event reporting requirements become effective in November 2023 and the remaining amendments become effective in May 2024. In August 2023, the SEC also adopted new rules and amendments that will require advisers to private funds to (i) obtain an annual audit for each private fund; (ii) provide investors with quarterly statements regarding private fund performance, fees and expenses; and (iii) obtain a fairness or valuation opinion in connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction. Compliance with certain aspects of the rules is required effective in September 2024 and with the remaining elements effective in March 2025. Money Market Fund Reforms. The regulatory structure governing U.S. money market funds was previously reformed to address perceived systemic risks of money market funds relating to fund stability and investor risks, including allowing certain funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain circumstances. In July 2023, the SEC adopted  11 11  11 Table of Contents Table of Contents  additional rule and form amendments concerning money market funds registered under the Investment Company Act. The amendments are intended to address problems experienced by certain money market funds in connection with the economic shock at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The new and amended rules will phase in through October 2024 and will, among other changes, impose increased minimum liquidity requirements, impose mandatory liquidity fees on institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt funds under certain circumstances, eliminate redemption gates, and permit share cancellation measures during periods of negative interest rates. In addition, the Form PF was further amended to require additional information regarding the private liquidity funds that an investment manager advises.  Fund Names Rule Reforms. In September 2023, the SEC adopted amendments to the fund \u201cNames Rule\u201d impacting regulated investment funds. The Names Rule generally requires a fund to invest at least 80% of the value of its assets in the particular type of investments or industry suggested by the fund's name. The amendments expand the applicability of the Names Rule and impacted funds may need to modify their names or alter their investment strategies to comply with the amendments, potentially impacting their portfolios. Funds with names that suggest a focus on investments that have particular characteristics, such as \u201cgrowth,\u201d \u201cvalue\u201d or thematic terms such as \u201cESG,\u201d would be required to adopt a policy to invest at least 80% of the fund\u2019s assets in those investments and would be subject to enhanced disclosure and reporting requirements. The SEC did not clearly define these terms and instead is allowing fund managers the flexibility to create their own reasonable definitions. Compliance with the rules is required effective in December 2025. U.S. and Global Tax Compliance. Our business may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by applicable tax and other governmental authorities. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an intergovernmental organization, has focused on addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy, which may further impact multinational businesses by allocating a greater share of taxing rights to countries where consumers are located regardless of the current physical presence of a business, and by implementing a global minimum tax. We will continue to monitor developments regarding such matters and any significant impacts on our effective tax rate. Non-U.S. Regulation Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to the laws and regulations of various non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies. Our international operations are subject to regulatory systems in various jurisdictions, comparable to those covering our operations in the U.S. Europe. In Luxembourg, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (\u201cCSSF\u201d) regulates our substantial activities in Luxembourg, including our subsidiary Franklin Templeton International Services S.\u00e0 r.l. (\u201cFTIS Lux\u201d). FTIS Lux is licensed as a management company for both the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (\u201cUCITS\u201d) and alternative investment funds (\u201cAIFs\u201d) and, as such, it manages our Luxembourg-domiciled UCITS and our EU-domiciled AIFs. FTIS Lux\u2019s license also covers certain investment services, such as discretionary portfolio management, investment advice and reception and transmission of orders in relation to financial instruments. The CSSF\u2019s rules include capital resource, governance and risk management requirements, business conduct rules, remuneration rules and oversight of systems and controls. Our international funds include two broad ranges of cross-border UCITS that are domiciled in Luxembourg and Ireland, as applicable, and thereby subject to regulation by the CSSF and the Central Bank of Ireland. Both UCITS are also registered for public sale in many countries around the world, both in the EU and beyond, and thus are also subject to the laws of, and certain supervision by, the governmental authorities of those countries. In the U.K., the Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (the \u201cPRA\u201d) currently regulate certain of our subsidiaries. Authorization by the FCA and the PRA is required to conduct any financial services-related business in the U.K. pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FCA\u2019s and PRA\u2019s rules under that act govern a firm\u2019s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, business conduct, interaction with clients, and systems and controls. 12 12  12 Table of Contents Table of Contents  In addition, the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, as revised and expanded in 2018 (\u201cMiFID II\u201d), regulates the provision of investment services and conduct of investment activities throughout the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d). As revised, MiFID II sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and business conduct of investment firms and regulated markets, and includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. It also includes an expansion of the types of instruments subject to these requirements, such as bonds, structured products and derivatives, and changes to business conduct requirements, including selling practices, intermediary inducements and client categorization. MiFID\u00a0II also includes a ban on commission and other payments (\u201cinducements\u201d) to independent advisers and discretionary managers, which has changed the commercial relationships between fund providers and distributors. Arrangements with non-independent advisers have also been affected, as narrower rules around the requirement that any commission reflect an enhancement of the service to customers come into effect, along with a prescriptive list of permissible non-monetary benefits. The interpretation of the inducements rules has also resulted in major changes to how fund managers finance investment research with many firms, including ours. The European Market Infrastructure Regulation sets out rules in relation to the central clearing of specified derivatives. Mutual recognition of central counterparties has been achieved between the EU regulatory authorities and other important jurisdictions including the U.S. In addition, there are rules relating to margin requirements for uncleared over-the-counter derivatives. Future regulatory policy reviews will decide whether these rules are extended to other types of derivative instruments, which could increase operational costs for our business and transactional costs for our clients. The EU\u2019s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (\u201cAIFMD\u201d) regulates managers of, and service providers to, AIFs that are domiciled and offered in the EU and that are not authorized as retail funds under UCITS. The AIFMD also regulates the marketing within the EU of all AIFs, including those domiciled outside the EU. The introduction of a third-country passport to non-EU AIFs/AIF managers has been delayed until further positive advice is delivered to the European Commission regarding a sufficient number of non-EU countries to better evaluate the impact, including with respect to the  withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU. Compliance with the AIFMD\u2019s requirements may restrict AIF marketing and imposes compliance obligations in the form of remuneration policies, capital requirements, reporting requirements, leverage oversight, valuation, stakes in EU companies, the domicile, duties and liability of custodians and liquidity management. The EU regulation on packaged retail investment and insurance products (\u201cPRIIPs\u201d) imposed new pre-contractual disclosure requirements under the form of a Key Information Document (\u201cKID\u201d) for the benefit of retail investors when they are considering the purchase of packaged retail investment products or insurance-based products.  The EU\u2019s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (\u201cSFDR\u201d) imposes mandatory ESG disclosure obligations on asset managers and other financial markets participants. SFDR requires all covered firms to disclose how financial products integrate sustainability risks in the investment process, including whether they consider  adverse sustainability impacts, and, for those products promoting sustainable objectives, the provision of sustainability-related information. Related amendments to applicable legislation require that all covered investment managers must consider in their investment process any ESG risks which are likely to have a material impact on the value of the investment, and require investment advisers to inquire as to the investor\u2019s desire for ESG-focused products in their portfolio when assessing suitability. The availability of such sustainability disclosure may impact the investment decisions of European investors.  The EU\u2019s proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (\u201cCSDD\u201d) would impose due diligence obligations requiring companies to identify, and to prevent or at least mitigate, adverse impacts on human rights and the environment, including by their subsidiaries and supply chain partners. Obligations would be enforced through administrative sanctions and civil liability, with a defense of having exercised reasonable due diligence. The CSDD proposal remains subject to ongoing review and negotiation in the EU. Australia. In Australia, our subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (\u201cASIC\u201d). ASIC regulates companies, financial markets and financial services in Australia. ASIC imposes certain conditions on licensed financial services organizations that apply to our subsidiaries, including requirements relating to capital resources, operational capability and controls. Canada. In Canada, our subsidiaries are subject to provincial and territorial laws and are registered with and regulated by provincial and territorial securities regulatory authorities. The mandate of Canadian securities regulatory authorities is generally to protect investors; to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets; to foster capital formation; and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Securities regulatory authorities impose certain requirements on registrants, including a standard of conduct, capital and insurance, record  13 13  13 Table of Contents Table of Contents  keeping, regulatory financial reporting, conflict of interest management, compliance systems and security holder reporting. In addition, one of our Canadian subsidiaries is a federally licensed trust company subject to regulation and supervision by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and another subsidiary is a member of and regulated by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization. These regulatory bodies have similar requirements to those of the securities regulatory authorities with a view to ensuring the capital adequacy and sound business practices of the subsidiaries and the appropriate treatment of their clients.  Cayman Islands. In the Cayman Islands, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (\u201cCIMA\u201d) is responsible for the regulation and supervision of financial services, the monitoring of compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, and the issuance of statements of principle and guidance. In February 2020, the Cayman Islands enacted the Private Funds Law 2020 (the \u201cPrivate Funds Law\u201d), which requires private funds that engage in business in or from the Cayman Islands to register with CIMA, unless an exemption applies. The Private Funds Law applies to any Cayman Islands closed-end fund. Open-end funds such as hedge funds continue to be regulated by the Mutual Funds Law in the Cayman Islands. The registration requirements applicable to our private funds domiciled in the Cayman Islands have posed, and may continue to pose, additional compliance costs and burdens on our business. Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, our applicable subsidiaries are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (\u201cSFO\u201d) and its subsidiary legislation, which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of dealing in securities and asset management activities and intermediaries. This legislation is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (\u201cSFC\u201d). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. Our subsidiaries and employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. India. The Securities and Exchange Board of India, Reserve Bank of India, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion are the major regulatory authorities that are capable of issuing directions of a binding nature to our subsidiaries in India. Japan. In Japan, our subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency, which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements, and business conduct rules. Singapore. In Singapore, our subsidiaries are subject to, among others, the Securities and Futures Act (\u201cSFA\u201d), the Financial Advisers Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) and the subsidiary legislation promulgated pursuant to these Acts, which are administered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (\u201cMAS\u201d). Our asset management subsidiaries and their employees conducting regulated activities specified in the SFA and/or the FAA are required to be licensed with the MAS. Other Non-U.S. Jurisdictions. There are similar legal and regulatory arrangements in effect in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where our subsidiaries, branches and representative offices, as well as certain joint ventures or companies in which we own minority stakes, are authorized to conduct business. We are also subject to regulation and supervision by, among others, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, the Central Bank of Brazil and the Comiss\u00e3o de Valores Mobili\u00e1rios in Brazil, the China Securities Regulatory Commission in the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service in South Korea, the Securities Commission in Malaysia, the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores in Mexico, the Polish Securities and Exchange Commission, the Romanian Financial Services Authority, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission, the Financial Supervisory Commission in the Republic of China, the Dubai Financial Services Authority in the United Arab Emirates, and the State Securities Commission of Vietnam. 14 14  14  Table of Contents Table of Contents  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  We have used, registered, and/or applied to register certain trademarks, service marks and trade names to distinguish our sponsored products and services from those of our competitors in the U.S. and in other countries and jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, Alcentra\u00ae, Benefit Street Partners\u00ae, Brandywine Global Investment Management\u00ae, Clarion Partners\u00ae, ClearBridge Investments\u00ae, Fiduciary Trust International\u2122, Franklin\u00ae, Franklin Bissett\u00ae, Franklin Mutual Series\u00ae, K2\u00ae, Legg Mason\u00ae, Lexington Partners\u00ae, Martin Currie\u00ae, O\u2019Shaughnessy\u00ae Asset Management, Royce\u00ae Investment Partners, Templeton\u00ae and Western Asset Management Company\u00ae.

If our brand is harmed, our future business prospects may be adversely affected.  HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES As of September\u00a030, 2023, we employed approximately 9,200 employees and operated offices in over 30 countries. We depend upon our key personnel to manage our business, including our portfolio managers, investment analysts, sales and management personnel and other professionals as well as our executive officers and business unit heads. Competition for experienced personnel is significant and from time to time we may experience a loss of valuable personnel. The retention of our key investment personnel is material to the management of our business. At an enterprise level, we use employee surveys to understand sentiment and engagement in the organization. At a team level, our performance management system supports ongoing, active discussion about goals and objectives. We also host live forums for leaders to engage directly with employees to help reinforce our culture of open feedback. Our employees have access to a valuable set of equitable and competitive total rewards, which consists of a mix of monetary and non-monetary rewards designed to recognize their time, talents and results.  Recognizing the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) is a priority in our organization. We believe that our ability to attract, develop and retain a diverse and highly-skilled workforce is important to our long-term success. We have developed DEI strategies and initiatives anchored in our core values. To support our DEI efforts, we have allocated dedicated resources for DEI, established a global governance structure, and have established research-based DEI policies and procedures.  We believe that our commitment to creating and maintaining a diverse workforce, including backgrounds and perspectives, makes us a better place to work and a more resilient business. We value an inclusive culture that leverages the expertise and perspectives of our diverse workforce as an important factor in our ability to deliver innovative and relevant client solutions in a dynamic marketplace.
