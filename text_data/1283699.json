Our Operations  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we provide wireless communications services to 113.6 million postpaid and prepaid customers and generate revenue by providing affordable wireless communications services to these customers, as well as a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. We also provide wholesale wireless services to various partners, who then offer the services for sale to their customers. Our most significant expenses relate to operating and expanding our network, providing a full range of devices, acquiring and retaining high-quality customers and compensating employees. We provide services, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, through our owned and operated retail stores, as well as through our websites (www.t-mobile.com and www.metrobyt-mobile.com), T-Mobile app, customer care channels and through national retailers. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third-party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites. The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.  Services and Products  We provide mobile wireless communications services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer for sale to customers a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets, home broadband routers and other mobile communication devices that are manufactured by various suppliers.   Our most popular service plan offering is Magenta Max, which allows customers to subscribe for wireless communications services separately from the purchase of a device. This plan includes unlimited talk, text and data on our network, 5G access at no extra cost, scam protection features and more. We also offer an Essentials rate plan for customers who want the basics at a lower price point, as well as specific rate plans to qualifying customers, including Business, Military and Veterans, First Responder, and Unlimited 55+.   At the time of device purchase, qualified customers can finance all or a portion of the individual device or accessory purchase price over an installment period, generally of 24 months, using an equipment installment plan (\u201cEIP\u201d). For certain existing customers, devices are leased over an initial period of up to 18 months and may be upgraded when eligibility requirements are met. 5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents In addition to our mobile wireless communications services, we offer High Speed Internet, which is a fixed wireless product that utilizes the excess capacity of our nationwide 5G network. Our fixed wireless product is available to millions of domestic households, providing an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers and expanding access to many people who have historically had only one choice or no access to traditional home broadband. With our High Speed Internet plan, customers can access the internet without worrying about annual service contracts, data overages or hidden fees.   We also provide products and services that are complementary to our wireless communications services, including device protection, financial services, advertising and wireline communication services to domestic and international customers. In September 2022, we entered into an agreement for the sale of the Wireline Business. See Note 16 \u2013 Wireline for additional information.  Customers  We provide wireless communications services to a variety of customers needing connectivity, but focus primarily on two categories of customers:   \u2022Postpaid customers generally are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, High Speed Internet, tablets, wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices; and \u2022Prepaid customers generally pay for wireless communications services, including High Speed Internet, in advance. Our prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.  Our customer base includes consumers as well as business customers, who are provided services under the T-Mobile for Business brand.  We provide Machine-to-Machine (\u201cM2M\u201d) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (\u201cMVNO\u201d) customers access to our network. This access and the customer relationship are managed by wholesale partners, with whom we have commercial agreements permitting them to sell services utilizing our network.   We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communications services to postpaid and prepaid customers. Our ability to attract and retain postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2022, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communications services by customer category were:  \u202275% Postpaid customers; \u202216% Prepaid customers; and  \u20229% Wholesale and other services.  Substantially all of our revenues for the years ended December\u00a031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were earned in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   Network Strategy  Utilizing our multi-layer spectrum portfolio, our mission is to become \u201cFamous for Network.\u201d We have deployed low-band, mid-band and mmWave spectrum dedicated for 5G across our dense and broad network to create what we believe is America\u2019s largest, fastest, most reliable and most awarded 5G network.   The Merger greatly enhanced our spectrum position. Integration of the spectrum and network assets acquired in the Merger is expected to continue through 2023. Our integration strategy includes deploying the acquired spectrum on the combined network assets to supplement capacity, migrating Sprint customers to our network and optimizing the combined assets by decommissioning redundant sites. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we have decommissioned substantially all targeted Sprint macro sites. As a result of the Merger, we have achieved, and expect to continue to achieve, significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within our network, as well as through other business processes and operations.  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Spectrum Position  We provide wireless communications services utilizing low-band spectrum licenses covering our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum, mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), Personal Communications Services (\u201cPCS\u201d) and 2.5 GHz spectrum, and mmWave spectrum.  \u2022We controlled, or expected to control based on previously announced auction results, an average of 388 MHz of combined low- and mid-band spectrum nationwide as of December\u00a031, 2022. This spectrum is comprised of: \u2022An average of 38 MHz in the 600 MHz band; \u2022An average of 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band; \u2022An average of 14 MHz in the 800 MHz band; \u2022An average of 40 MHz in the 1700 MHz AWS band; \u2022An average of 66 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band; \u2022An average of 181 MHz in the 2.5 GHz band; \u2022An average of 12 MHz in the 3.45 GHz band; and \u2022An average of 27 MHz in the C-band. \u2022We controlled an average of 1,157 GHz of combined mmWave spectrum licenses. \u2022In January 2022, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 199 licenses in Auction 110 (mid-band spectrum) for an aggregate purchase price of $2.9 billion. On May 4, 2022, the FCC issued to us the licenses won in Auction 110. \u2022In August 2022, we entered into license purchase agreements pursuant to which we will acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5\u00a0billion. See Note 6 \u2013 Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets for additional details. \u2022In September 2022, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 7,156 licenses in Auction 108 (2.5 GHz spectrum) for an aggregate price of $304\u00a0million. The timing of when the licenses will be issued will be determined by the FCC after all post-auction procedures have been completed.  \u2022We plan to evaluate future spectrum purchases in future auctions and in the secondary market to further augment our current spectrum position. \u2022As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had equipment deployed on approximately 79,000 macro cell sites and 41,000 small cell/distributed antenna system sites across our network.   5G Leadership  Our 5G network is America\u2019s largest, fastest, most reliable and most awarded:  \u2022As of December\u00a031, 2022, our Ultra Capacity 5G utilizing mid-band and mmWave spectrum covers 263 million people. \u2022As of December\u00a031, 2022, our total 5G coverage, including low-band spectrum, covers 325 million people, reaching 98% of Americans.  Competition  The wireless communications services industry is highly competitive. We are the second largest provider of wireless communications services in the U.S. as measured by our total postpaid and prepaid customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (\u201cAT&T\u201d) and Verizon Communications, Inc. (\u201cVerizon\u201d). In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller and regional carriers, MVNOs, including Comcast Corporation, Charter Communications, Inc., Altice USA, Inc. and DISH, many of which offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies and regulatory changes. Some of our competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing or offer bundled services as a potential source of differentiation.\u00a0  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Human Capital  Employees  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we employed approximately 71,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.  Attraction and Retention  We employ a highly skilled workforce within a broad range of functions. Substantially all of our employees are located throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico, to serve our nationwide network and retail operations. Our headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington, and Overland Park, Kansas.  We attract and retain our workforce through a dynamic and inclusive culture and by providing a comprehensive set of benefits, including:  \u2022Competitive medical, dental and vision benefits; \u2022Family-building benefits designed to meet the diverse needs of our employees, including IVF and IUI, adoption and surrogacy benefits; \u2022Annual stock grants to all full-time and part-time employees and a discounted Employee Stock Purchase Program; \u2022A 401(k) Savings Plan; \u2022Nationwide minimum pay of at least $20 per hour to all full-time and part-time employees; \u2022LiveMagenta: a custom-branded program for employee engagement and well-being, including free access to life coaches, financial coaches and tools for healthy living; \u2022Access to personal health advocates offering independent guidance; \u2022A generous paid time off program, including paid family leave; \u2022Tuition assistance for all full-time and part-time employees, including full tuition partnerships with multiple schools; and \u2022A matching program for employee donations and volunteering.  Training and Development  Career growth and development is foundational to T-Mobile\u2019s culture and success. We want to deliver the best experiences from the best teams, and one way we do that is by offering an array of development programs and resources to build diverse talent and empower our people to succeed through every step of their career. It is all easily accessible on our Magenta University site, which is our one-stop shop for all things career development and learning. The online learning portal is designed to put employees in the driver\u2019s seat and give them access to mentoring, training, videos, books, job search and interview tips, and much more.   By strategically investing in the following three key areas of career development and learning, we are developing our talent now and for the future.  \u2022Evolve skills and careers \u2013 Learn every day, champion relentless improvement, develop critical skills, explore career possibilities, and build the desired career;  \u2022Advance leadership expertise \u2013 Build critical leadership capabilities, enable leadership growth at all levels, and develop skills to lead in the future; and \u2022Champion diversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDE&I\u201d) - Promote inclusive habits and behaviors, enhance belonging and connectedness, and advocate for equitable opportunities.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  DE&I have always been a part of the Un-carrier culture, and we are committed to having DE&I touch every aspect of our future. Our Equity in Action Plan is a five-year plan that spans the values we live by, how we invest in and provide opportunities for our employees, how we select the suppliers we do business with and how we advocate for our communities.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents For our employees, we have established six DE&I Employee Resource Groups and four sub-affinity groups that have helped us establish and maintain a culture of inclusion. Currently, we have over 45 DE&I chapters across the nation that help spearhead volunteer opportunities, events and meaningful conversation with employees at a local level. Our DE&I Employee Resource Groups include the following:  \u2022Accessibility Community at T-Mobile; \u2022Multicultural Alliance; \u2022Asia Pacific & Allies Network; \u2022Black Empowerment Network; \u2022Indigenous Peoples Network; \u2022Magenta Latinx Network; \u2022Multigenerational Network; \u2022Pride; \u2022Veterans & Allies Network; and \u2022Women & Allies Network.   As part of T-Mobile\u2019s Equity In Action Plan and Promises, we have established an External Diversity and Inclusion Council in connection with our civil rights memorandum of understanding. The council includes civil rights leaders representing a wide range of underrepresented communities. Together with T-Mobile, the council will help identify ways to improve our efforts in focus areas such as corporate governance, workforce recruitment and retention, procurement, entrepreneurship, philanthropy and community investment. Since April 2020, we have achieved a significant portion of the Equity In Action Promises.  As DE&I are instrumental to our culture and values, we are also on a mission to create fair and equitable opportunities for all suppliers, including veteran-owned, disability-owned, woman-owned, minority-owned, LGBT-owned and small and disadvantaged businesses. We have implemented a Supplier Diversity Category Management Strategy for our network technology procurement organization to help identify opportunities and develop actionable targets for progress on this topic.  Environmental Sustainability  Reducing Carbon Footprint  We are working to reduce the impact of our operations on the climate by setting carbon reduction goals that are aligned with science and investing in renewable energy. We are reducing our carbon footprint through several initiatives, including:  \u2022Setting a science-based net-zero target for 2040 that includes Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions; \u2022Investing in renewable energy, as evidenced by our RE100 pledge, a global initiative that unites businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. We first met this goal in 2021 and then again in 2022 by matching our electricity usage with renewable energy credits acquired through a variety of sources, including through our engagement in Virtual Power Purchasing Agreements and a Green Direct tariff agreement with nine clean energy providers for expected annual provision of approximately 3.5 million megawatt hours of renewable electricity;  \u2022Continuously testing and evaluating new, efficient equipment for our facilities, including switch stations, cell sites, retail stores and customer experience centers to reduce energy consumption; and \u2022Promoting the circular economy through our device reuse and recycle program, which collects millions of devices for reuse, resale, and recycling annually.  Responsible Sourcing  We believe our suppliers are a valuable extension of our business and corporate values. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines expectations around ethical business practices for our suppliers. We require our suppliers to operate in full compliance with the laws, rules, regulations and ethical standards of the countries in which they operate or provide products or services. We expect our suppliers to share our commitment to ethical conduct and environmentally responsible business practices while they conduct business with or on behalf of us.  We employ a third-party risk management (\u201cTPRM\u201d) process to screen for anti-corruption, global sanctions, human rights and environmental risks before engaging with a supplier. Our TPRM process also continuously monitors current suppliers for policy violations and risks. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Regulation  The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cCommunications Act\u201d). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911, 988 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly.   Except for operations in certain unlicensed frequency bands, wireless communications services providers generally must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas, and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority both to revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the FCC retains the right to modify rules related to use of licensed spectrum, which could impact T-Mobile\u2019s ability to provide services.  Additionally, Congress\u2019s and the FCC\u2019s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (\u201cCMRS\u201d), which includes cellular, PCS and other wireless services, could significantly increase and intensify competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses or our competitive position in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers\u2019 spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers.   Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest, but must be reviewed and approved. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT.  For our Educational Broadband Service (\u201cEBS\u201d) licenses in the 2.5 GHz band, FCC rules previously limited eligibility to hold EBS licenses to accredited educational institutions and certain governmental, religious and nonprofit entities, while permitting those license holders to lease up to 95% of their capacity for non-educational purposes. Therefore, we have historically accessed EBS spectrum primarily through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial term equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. On April 27, 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. The elimination of these restrictions allows current license holders to sell their licenses, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated. T-Mobile has started to acquire some of these EBS licenses, but we continue to lease spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time.  While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communications services providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, service mapping, protection of consumer information, zoning and land use. Notwithstanding this federal preemption, several states are considering or have passed laws or regulations  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents that could potentially set prices, minimum performance standards and/or restrictions on service discontinuation that could impact our business in those states.  In addition, following the FCC\u2019s adoption of the 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom (\u201cRIF\u201d) Order reclassifying broadband internet access services as non-common carrier \u201cinformation services\u201d, a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality, rate-setting, and privacy requirements on providers\u2019 broadband services. The FCC\u2019s RIF Order expressly preempted such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC\u2019s federal deregulatory approach. In 2019, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order, but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local measures regulating broadband services. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC RIF Order and be preempted; court challenges to some state enactments are pending.  While most states pursuing net neutrality legislation are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, which have passed privacy laws; and New York, which has passed a broadband rate-setting law. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements. Ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws, is critical to this effort. If not preempted or rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress.  In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection matters and the elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are, to some extent, unknown, and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.
