In addition to traditional payroll processing and HR service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and HR systems and departments. Payroll and HR systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our solutions also compete with a variety of providers of HR services, such as retirement services companies, insurance companies, HR and benefits consulting firms, and national and regional PEOs. \u00a0 Competition in the payroll processing and HR services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and reputation, including ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of service and product offerings, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas. We believe that our leading-edge technology and mobility applications, combined with personalized support provided by industry professionals and our technology-enabled solution capabilities, distinguishes us from our competitors. \u00a0 Software Maintenance and Development \u00a0 The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and HR services to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintaining our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace. We continue to enhance our SaaS solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience. Continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success. \u00a0 8 Table of Contents \u00a0 Human Capital \u00a0 We believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is critical to our future success and growth. We strive to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive (\u201cDE&I\u201d) workplace; attract, retain, and develop talented employees; and keep them safe. In fiscal 2023, we were a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge, the single largest business-led initiative to advance DE&I in the workplace. We also created a new DE&I leadership position to ensure that our efforts in building and sustaining a diverse culture of inclusion are realized. \u00a0 For detailed information regarding our human capital activities, we encourage investors to visit our Corporate Responsibility website page at https://www.paychex.com/corporate/corporate-responsibility. We have also made our Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) report available on our website. The information contained on our website and in our ESG report is not and should not be viewed as being incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. \u00a0 Our Employees: As of May 31, 2023, we employed approximately 16,600 people, primarily in the U.S. and on a full-time basis. None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.  \u00a0 Paychex Culture: Our core cultural values (\u201cPaychex Values\u201d) are designed to guide decision making aligned to the expectations of clients, stockholders, regulators, employees, and the multiple communities in which we operate and to reflect our continuing commitment to DE&I. The Paychex Values are: \u00a0 Integrity Accountability Innovation Partnership Respect Service \u00a0 Each of these values guide our decision-making process and are critical to our ongoing success. All employees are required to verify their understanding and observance of these values during our annual \u201cRight Way\u201d training, review these values with management during periodic performance discussions, and are further encouraged to attend ongoing training during the year. Volunteer \u201cCulture Champions\u201d throughout the Company also help promote these values daily. We encourage employee feedback through our employee engagement surveys, as described below. This approach empowers our employees and allows us to make a positive impact in the communities we work and serve. As a result of our commitment to these principles, in 2023 we were recognized by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, as one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies. We have achieved this recognition 15 times, and consecutively since 2012. In addition, we were also recognized by Forbes as a Best Employer for Diversity for 2023. \u00a0 Talent Acquisition and Development: We compete for talent along with our direct competitors and other companies in the geographic areas we serve. We invest significant resources to attract and retain top talent. Our Talent Acquisition Team, in conjunction with certain third-party partners, have developed comprehensive processes to identify and recruit accomplished professionals.  \u00a0 Once hired, our world-class Training Department provides functional training for payroll and HCM specialists and sales associates and also offers personal training, professional development, and leadership-development programs. As a result of our efforts, we have been recognized as one of the top training organizations in the world with a 2023 Training APEX Award presented by Training magazine. Paychex ranked number five on the prestigious list for the second year. This is also the Company's 22nd consecutive appearance on the list that identifies organizations that excel at training and employee development. \u00a0 Comprehensive Compensation and Benefits: We are committed to providing a fair wage and a total rewards package that allows our employees to be their best in every area of their lives. We regularly review employee salaries to ensure we are competitive in the industry and offer financial benefits such as a 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, tuition assistance, scholarships for children of employees, and financial education. We are also committed to rewarding employees with comprehensive and competitive benefits and well-being package which includes medical, prescription, dental, and vision insurance, short- and long-term disability, employee assistance program, paid family leave, and a variety of well-being programs. For fiscal 2023, compensation-related expenses accounted for approximately 60% of our total expenses.  \u00a0 Employee Well-being Initiatives: In addition to providing a comprehensive compensation and benefits package, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees. Healthier employees are at lower risk of injury from workplace related exposures, perform work more safely with lower rates of absenteeism, experience better job performance, and can live their lives more fully outside of work. Our well-being program is a robust program focusing on the physical, emotional, community, career, and financial health of our employees.  9 Table of Contents \u00a0 \u00a0 Our award-winning well-being initiatives offer a wide variety of services, tools, and resources that can help employees achieve their health goals using a holistic approach. In addition, we sponsor onsite health screenings, Red Cross blood donation events, flu vaccination clinics, vaping and tobacco cessation, weight management, resiliency training, meditation and yoga classes, and a variety of other programs. Similar to our Culture Champions, we also promote the use of \u201cWell-Being Champions\u201d - Paychex employees who serve as a liaison between the Employee Well-Being Program and their team members. Our employees\u2019 financial well-being is equally important, so we have developed programs for financial education and support. We maintain procedures for events such as fires, severe weather, medical emergencies, and active shooters, as well as other important information related to general workforce safety. \u00a0 In recognizing the ever-growing diversity of our workplace, we annually celebrate Paychex Culture Day. This is an additional paid day off for employees to celebrate and recognize a holiday that is significant to them. This is just one of the many ways we celebrate our unique heritages, and it reflects our Company's commitment to DE&I and flexibility. \u00a0 Employee Engagement: We regularly ask our employees to share their views on working at Paychex through company-wide engagement surveys. Facilitated internally by our Human Resources Organizational Development Team, the survey methodology is periodically updated to reflect currents trends and issues including company direction and strategy, DE&I, individual development, collaboration, and our Paychex Values. A third-party administers the survey in order to maintain confidentiality of responses.\u202fWe use the survey responses to help inform management and assist in developing programs and policies that will maintain and promote Paychex Values. \u00a0 Intellectual Property \u00a0 We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Collectively, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the \u201cPaychex\u201d name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us. \u00a0 Seasonality \u00a0 There is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients, and new worksite employees associated with our ASO and PEO businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many businesses prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to year-end bonus payments, additional year-end services, and the preparation and delivery of end-of year reporting requirements.  \u00a0 Available Information \u00a0 We are subject to the informational and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).
