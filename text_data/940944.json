(2)Includes Puerto Rico and Guam.  Darden Restaurants, Inc. is a Florida corporation incorporated in March 1995, and is the parent company of GMRI, Inc., also a Florida corporation. GMRI, Inc. and certain other of our subsidiaries own and operate our restaurants. GMRI, Inc. was originally incorporated in March 1968 as Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. We were acquired by General Mills, Inc. in 1970 and became a separate publicly held company in 1995 when General Mills distributed all of our outstanding stock to the stockholders of General Mills.  Our principal executive offices and restaurant support center are located at 1000 Darden Center Drive, Orlando, Florida 32837, telephone (407)\u00a0245-4000. Our corporate website address is www.darden.com. We make our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, Section\u00a016 reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5, and all amendments to those reports available free of charge on our website the same day as the reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information on our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to \u201cDarden,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d include Darden Restaurants, Inc., GMRI, Inc. and our respective subsidiaries.  On June 14, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Ruth\u2019s Hospitality Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Ruth\u2019s), for  $21.50 per share in cash.  Ruth\u2019s is the owner, operator and franchisor of restaurants under the Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House\u00ae trademark.  As the acquisition was subsequent to our fiscal year ended on May 28, 2023, there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements or operations.  As of the closing, Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House had 155 locations around the globe, including 81 company-owned or company-operated restaurants and 74 franchised restaurants.  Because our acquisition of Ruth\u2019s was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the description of the business throughout this Item 1 does not include a description of Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House unless specifically referenced herein.  We have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending the last Sunday in May. Our fiscal year 2023 ended May\u00a028, 2023 and consisted of 52 weeks, fiscal 2022 ended May\u00a029, 2022 and consisted of 52 weeks, and fiscal 2021 ended May\u00a030, 2021 and consisted of 52 weeks. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information in Part II of this report under the caption \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d  1 1 1   COVID-19 Pandemic and Other Impacts to our Operating Environment  During fiscal 2022, increases in the number of cases of COVID-19 throughout the United States including the Omicron variant which significantly impacted our restaurants in the third quarter, subjected some of our restaurants to other COVID-19-related restrictions such as mask and/or vaccine requirements for team members, guests or both.  Along with COVID-19, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, leading to higher than usual inflation on wages and other cost of goods sold; these events further impacted the availability of team members needed to staff our restaurants and caused additional disruptions in our product supply chain.  During fiscal 2023, these events have continued to impact our operating results as wage and cost inflation continue to exceed recent norms.  The ongoing efforts to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants, along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events could impact our restaurants through wage inflation, staffing challenges, product cost inflation and disruptions in the supply chain that impact our restaurants\u2019 ability to obtain the products needed to support their operations. Segment Information We manage our restaurant brands in North America as operating segments. The brands operate principally in the U.S. within full-service dining. We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-segment of full-service dining within which each brand operates. We have four reportable segments: 1) Olive Garden, 2) LongHorn Steakhouse, 3) Fine Dining (which, as of the end of fiscal 2023, includes The Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s) and 4) Other Business (which includes Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, The Capital Burger and results from our franchise operations). External sales are derived principally from food and beverage sales, we do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales and the customers and long-lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the U.S. There were no material transactions among reportable segments.

Strategy We believe that capable operators of strong multi-unit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry\u2019s full-service segment. Generally, the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments: quick service, fast casual, and full-service. All of our restaurants fall within the full-service segment, which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains. We believe we have strong brands, and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full-service restaurant industry. This collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business, including restaurant operations excellence, brand management excellence, supply chain, talent management and information technology, among other things. Our operating philosophy remains focused on strengthening the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation, attentive service, engaging atmosphere, and integrated marketing. Darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale, insights, and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages. Additionally, our brands can capitalize on data driven insights to deliver customized one-to-one customer relationship marketing. We hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders. 4 4 4    Recent and Planned Restaurant Growth  During fiscal 2023, we added 47 net new company-owned restaurants in the United States.

(4)The Capital Burger is a development-stage concept with limited pro-forma information, and as such, it is excluded from this table.  We project opening approximately 3-4 Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House restaurants during fiscal 2024 which is captured in the total projected new restaurant openings above. While our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands, the actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal 2024 will depend on many factors, including our ability to recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel, locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms, obtain necessary local governmental permits, and complete construction. We consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant\u2019s long-term success, and we devote significant effort to the site selection process. Prior to entering a market, we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants. Our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors. These factors include trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; competitive influences in the trade area; the site\u2019s visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition. Constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 250 days on average after the site is acquired and permits are obtained. We systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards. When a restaurant falls below minimum standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement operational and marketing plans to improve that restaurant\u2019s performance. If performance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other brands. Permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas, the expiration of lease agreements, or site concerns. Accordingly, we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges.  5 5 5    Restaurant Operations  We believe that high-quality restaurant management is critical to our long-term success. Our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size. We issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards.  The management structures below describe our restaurant operations during the normal and fully operational conditions that were in place at the end of fiscal 2023. Since the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the staffing levels at many of our restaurants have returned to pre-pandemic levels.   Each Olive Garden restaurant is led by a General Manager, and each LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen restaurant is led by a Managing Partner. Each also has three to six additional managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. In addition, each restaurant typically employs between 35 to 200 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time. Restaurant General Managers or Managing Partners report to a Director of Operations who is responsible for approximately five to eleven restaurants. Each Director of Operations reports to a Senior Vice President of Operations who is responsible for between 80 and 120 restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities for improvement.   Each Yard House and Bahama Breeze restaurant is led by a General Manager, and each The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V\u2019s and The Capital Burger restaurant is led by a Managing Partner. Each also has three to ten additional managers. Each Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52 and Eddie V\u2019s restaurant has one executive chef and one to two sous chefs. The Capital Burger restaurant has one sous chef and each Bahama Breeze restaurant has one to three culinary managers.  In addition, each restaurant typically employs between 60 to 200 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time. The General Manager or Managing Partner of each restaurant reports directly to a Director of Operations, who has operational responsibility for approximately three to eleven restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities for improvement.  Our Learning and Development team in partnership with each brand\u2019s training leader, together with senior operations executives, is responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs. These efforts include an eight to twelve-week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for all levels of leadership. The emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand, but includes inclusive leadership, restaurant business management and culinary skills. We also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants, including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations. The opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening. They are re-deployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant\u2019s operating staff.  We maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our management-level team members. We believe that our leadership position, strong results-oriented culture and various short-term and long-term incentive programs, including stock-based compensation, enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers. Quality Assurance  Our Total Quality Department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe, high-quality food in a clean and safe environment.  Through rigorous supplier and risk-based product evaluations, we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications. We rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors. Suppliers that produce \u201chigh-risk\u201d products are subject to a food safety evaluation by Darden personnel at least annually. We require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with comprehensive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety programs and risk-based preventative controls adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause food-borne illnesses by applying scientifically-based controls to analyze hazards, identify and monitor critical control points, and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met. Third party auditors inspect each restaurant regularly throughout the year to assess food safety and sanitation practices. Our total quality team verifies the application of preventative controls through on-site support visits ensuring an effective and robust  6 6 6   food safety system. Total quality managers provide support to operations staff with education and training in food safety and sanitation. The team also serves as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety. Purchasing and Distribution Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe, high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement. Our purchasing staff sources, negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1,500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries. Suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development, harvest, catch and production of food products. Competitive bids, long-term contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products. We believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability. Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United States and internationally to source top-quality food products at competitive prices.  We actively engage with and monitor our suppliers, both in person and remotely, including hosting virtual visits and audits.  We believe that we have established excellent long-term relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers (not brokers or middlemen).  We actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that we incorporate women- and minority-owned businesses in our purchasing decisions. We have entered into long-term agreements with multiple third-party national distribution companies to deliver food and supplies to our restaurants. Under these arrangements we maintain ownership of the food and supplies inventory through our subsidiary Darden Direct Distribution, Inc. (Darden Direct).  This inventory is stored in distribution company warehouses that are wholly or primarily dedicated to Darden where practical to do so.  Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales. We continue to drive automation of our supply chain by collaborating with our suppliers, logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility and other technological advances.  These and other terms of Darden Direct\u2019s long-term supply agreements further enable our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into our purchasing operations, driving efficiencies in our operations.  Advertising and Marketing  Integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy, and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full-service dining segment of the restaurant industry. Olive Garden leverages the efficiency of national advertising, on both traditional and streaming television, supplemented with additional targeted digital media investments. LongHorn Steakhouse uses digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market. Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, Eddie V\u2019s and The Capital Burger do not use television advertising, but rely on local and digital marketing. Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising and marketing to build awareness and strengthen our brands\u2019 relevance. We implement periodic promotions, as appropriate, to increase frequency of guest visits while maintaining overall profitability. We also rely on outdoor billboard and email advertising, as well as radio, digital coupons, search engine marketing and social media such as Facebook\u00ae and Instagram\u00ae, as appropriate, to attract, engage and retain our guests. We have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and marketplace dynamics.  In fiscal 2023, we continued a multi-year effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in an increasingly connected society.  We also continued making improvements to our online and mobile ordering and payment systems across all of our brands. In addition, we continued working on developing sophisticated customer relationship management programs, data analytics and data-driven marketing approaches to effectively and efficiently target our existing and potential guests across our portfolio of brands.  This enables us to tailor our messaging and offerings depending on guest visit history, preferences and brand loyalty.  Human Capital  We prioritize our team members through our People Strategy that includes four strategic imperatives: \u2022Hire - Attract and select diverse team members that reflect our values and are committed to our results-oriented culture; \u2022Train - Teach team members to perform in today\u2019s environment and develop the skills to meet tomorrow\u2019s needs; 7 7 7   \u2022Reward - Invest in compelling programs that recognize team members when goals are achieved and further motivate our culture of winning; and  \u2022Retain - Keep team members engaged and motivated, ready to deliver results and grow their careers.  We closely track and assess a variety of metrics that help us to evaluate our performance on each of these imperatives.  Hire.  We are committed to attracting, engaging, developing and retaining a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests and the communities in which we operate.  We track a variety of workforce statistics to help us understand the gender, racial and ethnic diversity of our team members. Key team member statistics as of the end of fiscal 2023 included the following:  Total team members (hourly and salaried)187,384Total number of hourly team members177,164Percent of hourly team members \u2013 female58%Percent of hourly team members \u2013 members of racial or ethnic minority groups55%Total number of new hires of hourly team members during fiscal 2023182,882Percent of hourly new hires \u2013 female57%Percent of hourly new hires \u2013 members of racial or ethnic minority groups57% Total team members (hourly and salaried) Total number of hourly team members Percent of hourly team members \u2013 female Percent of hourly team members \u2013 members of racial or ethnic minority groups Total number of new hires of hourly team members during fiscal 2023 Percent of hourly new hires \u2013 female Percent of hourly new hires \u2013 members of racial or ethnic minority groups  In addition to the gender, racial and ethnic diversity of our workforce, our team members are also very diverse in age; we employ members of five generations of the United States population: Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials and Centennials. We provide our EEO-1 report and additional details about our inclusion and diversity programs on our website at www.darden.com.  Train. We succeed because of our people, and with our success come rewards, recognition and great opportunities for our team members. We regularly invest in our team members\u2019 careers by providing the tools they need to succeed in their current roles, to grow personally and professionally, and to deliver exceptional experiences to our guests each day. With thousands of leadership positions across our restaurants, we provide a pathway and training for thousands of individuals across the country to advance from entry-level jobs into management roles. In fiscal 2023, 81% of the participants in our restaurant Manager In Training program were internal promotions and 100% of the new General Managers or Managing Partners were internal promotions.  Reward.  We believe that we provide working conditions and pay and benefits that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Most team members, other than restaurant management and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis. We offer our team members flexible work schedules and competitive pay and benefits, including paid sick leave and access to free counseling through our employee assistance program for team members and their families.   We regularly review our pay and benefits programs to identify and implement enhancements to the ways we reward our team members. In January 2022, we announced that each hourly restaurant team member company-wide would earn a minimum hourly wage of at least $12 per hour, inclusive of tip income.  Also in January 2022, we began a new \"First Rewards\u201d program to provide a phantom stock grant worth $10,000 to newly promoted General Managers and Managing Partners, numbering approximately 300 annually, to reward these high-performing leaders and provide immediate alignment between their compensation and shareholder value creation. Further, in fiscal 2023, the Darden Restaurants Foundation introduced the Next Course Scholarship program for children and dependents of our team members and in its inaugural year, the program awarded scholarships worth $3,000 each to nearly 100 children or dependents of Darden team members.  In January 2023, we introduced a new benefit for restaurant team members called Fast Fluency \u2013 which offers Spanish-speaking team members the chance to learn English for free.   None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our team member relations to be good, with our employee engagement levels nearly double the United States average, as recently surveyed by Gallup, Inc.  Consistent with our core values of respect, caring and teamwork, in fiscal 1999 we established a program called Darden Dimes to help fellow Darden team members in need. Darden Dimes provides short-term financial grants to team members experiencing financial need caused by unexpected emergencies or catastrophic natural disasters. Participating team members  8 8 8   donate as little as 10 cents from each paycheck to the Darden Dimes fund, which raised and granted over $2.0 million in fiscal 2023.  Retain. As a full-service restaurant company, food is always top of mind, but our team members make the difference: they are at the heart of everything we do. We believe the guest experience can never exceed the team member experience, so we strive to hire the best individuals and retain them by fostering an environment of respect and inclusion, where diversity of thought and background is valued and everyone has the opportunity to develop and grow their careers. In addition, our geographic footprint often puts us in a position to offer our restaurant team members jobs in their current roles when personal circumstances require relocation.  Darden\u2019s consolidated turnover rate for hourly team members during fiscal 2023 was 93%, one of the lowest rates in the restaurant industry. Each of our brands experienced a turnover rate during fiscal 2023 that was lower than the most recent relevant casual dining or fine dining turnover rate for their segment of the industry as reported in The People ReportTM by Black Box IntelligenceTM. Darden\u2019s consolidated restaurant management turnover rate of 19% was also significantly lower than the broader restaurant industry benchmark.  Our executive leadership (vice president and above) has an average of over 17 years of experience with Darden, while our restaurant General Managers and Managing Partners have an average of 14 years of experience with us.  Information Technology and Cybersecurity  We strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy. We have implemented technology-enabled business solutions to improve financial control, cost management, guest service and employee effectiveness, as well as enable e-commerce. These solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand.  Our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence. Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in Orlando, Florida. Our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently.  We leverage public cloud computing where appropriate to enhance our capabilities and to leverage scale.  Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both our data and the physical computing assets. We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off-site, testing the disaster recovery plan annually and providing on-site power backup. We periodically engage third parties to perform cybersecurity audits utilizing the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework. We also engage third parties to conduct security reviews of our network, processes and systems on a regular basis.  We use internally developed proprietary software, cloud-based software as a service (SaaS), as well as purchased software, with proven, non-proprietary hardware.  All of our brands share a secure, robust digital platform with online ordering and other guest-facing capabilities. We also have deployed mobile applications with online ordering and other features for all of our casual dining brands and for most of our specialty restaurant brands. We successfully leverage these digital capabilities to address evolving guest needs. We will continue to invest in these platforms and applications to enhance the guest experience.    We maintain a robust system of data protection and cybersecurity resources, technology and processes. We regularly evaluate new and emerging risks and ever-changing legal and compliance requirements. We make strategic investments to address these risks and compliance requirements to keep Company, guest and team member data secure. We monitor risks of sensitive information compromise at our business partners where relevant and reevaluate these risks on a periodic basis. We also perform annual and ongoing cybersecurity awareness training for our restaurant management and restaurant support center team members. In addition, we provide annual credit card handling training following Payment Card Industry (PCI) guidelines to all team members that handle guest credit cards.  Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates positions us well to support current needs and future growth. We use a strategic information systems multi-year planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning. We provide data protection and cybersecurity reports to the Audit Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and periodically to the full Board of Directors. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory, risk and other business advantage criteria. Competition The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, brand, attractiveness of facilities, availability of carryout and home delivery, internet and mobile ordering  9 9 9   capabilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers\u2019 discretionary purchasing power. We compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. In addition, expanding product offerings at fast casual and quick-service restaurants and the convenience of home delivery services, together with negative economic conditions, could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives or reduce the frequency of their restaurant visits. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas. Other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled \u201cPurchasing and Distribution,\u201d \u201cAdvertising and Marketing\u201d and \u201cInformation Technology and Cybersecurity\u201d in this Item\u00a01 and in our Risk Factors in Item\u00a01A of this Form 10-K. Trademarks and Service Marks We regard our Olive Garden\u00ae, LongHorn Steakhouse\u00ae, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen\u00ae, Yard House\u00ae, The Capital Grille\u00ae, Seasons 52\u00ae, Bahama Breeze\u00ae, Eddie V\u2019s Prime Seafood\u00ae, The Capital Burger\u00ae, Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House\u00ae, Darden\u00ae and Darden Restaurants\u00ae service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts.  Our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to vigorously oppose any infringement of them.  Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely.  Franchises, Joint Ventures and New Business Development As of May\u00a028, 2023, we operated 1,914 restaurants through subsidiaries in the United States and Canada. We own all of those locations, except for 2 restaurants managed by us and owned by joint ventures in which we hold a majority ownership.  We control the joint ventures\u2019 use of our service marks and the joint ventures pay management fees to us, which are not material to our consolidated financial statements. As of May\u00a028, 2023, franchisees operated 34 franchised restaurants in the United States and 35 franchised restaurants outside of the United States.  We have area development, franchise and/or license agreements in place with unaffiliated operators to develop and operate Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, The Capital Grille and Bahama Breeze restaurants in the following regions: \u2022United States (including Puerto Rico and Guam), \u2022Mexico,  \u2022Central and South America (Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama), \u2022Philippines, \u2022Aruba, and \u2022Saudi Arabia. The open and operating franchised restaurants are all reflected in the table under the \u201cIntroduction\u201d section of this Item 1.  We do not have an ownership interest in any of these franchisees, but we receive fees under the area development and franchise agreements and royalty income under the franchise or license agreements.  The amount of income we derive from our franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements. We license the sales and distribution of several items including Olive Garden salad dressings, salad croutons and seasoning through various channels including wholesale distribution chains and major grocery chains.  The amount of income we derive from these licensing arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements. Seasonality Our sales volumes have historically fluctuated seasonally. Typically, our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall.  Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of the historical seasonality of our business and these other factors, results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.   10 10 10   Government Regulation We are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business.  Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located.  The development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations.  To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals. During fiscal 2023, 11.2 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages.  Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site (in most cases, on an annual basis), and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.  As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on restaurants, many states have modified their regulations to permit To Go sales of alcoholic beverages, and in some locations we now offer a variety of alcoholic beverages, including in bottles, from draft and mixed drinks To Go.  The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these alcoholic beverage licenses or to comply with regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages would adversely affect the restaurant\u2019s operations. We also are subject in certain states to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party.  We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance. We also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime, tip credits, working conditions, paid leave, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices. Since 1995, Darden has had a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment (TRAC) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\u00a0 TRAC requirements, which include increased educational and other efforts in each restaurant to increase the reporting compliance of employees with respect to cash tips, are applied across all of our brands.\u00a0 Compliance with TRAC requirements reduces the likelihood of potential employer-only FICA tax assessments related to cash tips that are unreported by employees at Darden\u2019s covered units.  Consistent with our long-standing agreement with the IRS, we work proactively with IRS personnel responsible for tip compliance to ensure that we are taking the appropriate steps to continue to meet our TRAC obligations. \u00a0In 2023, the IRS issued a proposed revenue procedure that would establish the Service Industry Tip Compliance Agreement (SITCA) program and eliminate TRAC. We are working closely with the IRS as it finalizes its guidance. We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal 2023, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated. Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and related state accessibility statutes.  Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible. We are subject to federal and state regulations relating to employer-provided health insurance, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations.  We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling.  We are subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content.  We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud.  An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information.  As a merchant and service provider of point-of-sale services, we are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard issued by the Payment Card Industry Council (PCI DSS).   We are subject to anti-corruption laws in the United States and in the international jurisdictions where we do business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  We are also subject to a variety of international laws relating to franchising and licensing of intellectual property in the various countries across the world where we are engaged in franchising our restaurant brands. See Item\u00a01A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d below for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of data privacy and environmental matters. 11 11 11   Sustainability  The sustainability of our food sources and restaurant operations is a key component of providing great service and food to our guests. During fiscal 2023, we remained focused on our climate strategy, restaurant sustainability metrics and Darden\u2019s Animal Welfare Council. We will continue to adapt our sustainability approach with development or enhancement of integrated and strategic priorities in the near term across the enterprise, from the food we source to the operation of our restaurants.   Darden manages energy and water conservation within our restaurant operations and engages with our supply chain partners on sustainability topics including climate, deforestation and animal welfare. In fiscal 2023, Darden expanded its assessment and disclosure of environmental metrics in our operations and extended value chain. Additional environmental indicators, including energy and water consumption, waste generation and diversion, as well as Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, are reported on our website at www.darden.com/our-impact/communities/sustainability.  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions(1)Fiscal Year Ended(in metric tons CO2e)May 29, 2022May 30, 2021May 31, 2020Average Per Restaurant (2)412373(3)424Total - Scope 1 and 2769,811(4)683,294774,200 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions(1) (in metric tons CO2e) Average Per Restaurant (2) 373(3) Total - Scope 1 and 2 769,811(4) (1)GHG reporting is for the fiscal year preceding the year of this report and is not available for the current financial reporting period.

(3)Fiscal 2021 emissions reductions resulted from business impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic during fiscal 2021. (4)APEX Companies, LLC. provided a statement of third-party verification to a limited assurance level for the above stated values for fiscal year 2022 in accordance with ISO Standard 14064-3 Second edition 2019-4 on greenhouse gases- Part 3: Specification with guidance for the verification and validation of GHG statements.  We shared Darden\u2019s Food Principles in 2016 to outline our commitment to guests in areas of sustainable sourcing, nutritional disclosure, food safety and animal welfare. Darden\u2019s Food Principles connect each of these strategic business efforts in a guest-centered platform, including sourcing and ingredient commitments to our guests. We have set commitments related to the following food attributes: animal welfare, chickens raised without medically-important antibiotics, cage-free eggs and gestation crate-free pork. We continue to work with our supplier partners to make progress toward these commitments and we provide annual updates on our efforts in the Sustainability section of our website, www.darden.com.  Building on our Food Principles, Darden established an Animal Welfare Policy that adopts an outcomes-based approach to continue to ensure high level of care for farm animals in the food supply chain. To implement this policy, we established an Animal Welfare Council consisting of leading academics and thought leaders with expertise in the care of animals in food supply chains. The Council advises and supports the Company on our efforts to advance strategy and implementation of an outcomes-based approach to animal welfare, from supplier collaborations to reporting improvements.   More information about our sustainability strategy, our commitment to our guests on Food Principles and our progress to date is available at www.darden.com. Darden Foundation and Community Affairs We are recognized for a culture that rewards caring for and responding to people. That defines service for Darden. The Darden Restaurants, Inc. Foundation (the Foundation) works to bring this spirit of service to life through its philanthropic support of charitable organizations across the country and support for the volunteer involvement of our team members. The Foundation does this by focusing its philanthropic efforts on programs that enhance the communities where our team members and guests live and work. In addition, team members at our Restaurant Support Center are eligible for 16 hours per calendar year of paid time for approved community service activities during scheduled work hours.  In fiscal 2023, the Foundation awarded approximately $4.2 million in grants to national organizations as well as local nonprofits including Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida and the Heart of Florida United Way. These organizations  12 12 12   provide service to the public through hunger relief, community engagement, disaster preparedness and the promotion of career opportunities in the culinary industry.  The Foundation continued to invest in mobile food pantry programs through its long-standing partnership with Feeding America. In fiscal 2023, the Foundation awarded a $2.0 million grant to help fund 10 additional refrigerated box trucks to help Feeding America increase access to nutritious food and address transportation needs at food banks that are under-resourced and serve a high percentage of people of color. The most recent donation marks a total of $16.3 million that the Foundation and Darden have contributed to the Feeding America network since 2010.  Our support of Feeding America and the fight against hunger goes hand-in-hand with our Darden Harvest program, which began in 2003 as a mechanism for delivering fresh and healthy food to people who need it. Each day, our restaurants collect surplus, wholesome food that is not served to guests and, rather than discarding the food, they prepare it for donation to local nonprofit feeding partners. In fiscal 2023, Darden contributed approximately 5.3 million pounds of food, the equivalent of more than 4.4 million meals provided to people in need across the communities served by our restaurants. As an added benefit of the Darden Harvest program, we are able to divert millions of pounds of surplus food from waste streams every year.  In fiscal 2023, as part of Darden\u2019s continued commitment to inclusion and diversity, the Foundation donated an additional $500,000 to Boys & Girls Clubs of America to support the development and implementation of programming that will help youth embrace diversity and combat racial discrimination. The Youth for Unity curriculum will provide meaningful, action-oriented solutions to address social injustice and racial inequity and help foster the next generation of leaders, problem-solvers and advocates for change.  The Foundation\u2019s funding helps support the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation\u2019s ProStart program, a national high school program that introduces students to the restaurant industry and provides them with an industry-driven curriculum on topics ranging from culinary techniques to management skills. The Foundation\u2019s fiscal 2023 contribution of $250,000 also supports the Restaurant Ready program to engage and encourage disconnected young people to pursue a path to employment and improve their quality of life.  We are also a proud member of the American Red Cross\u2019 Annual Disaster Giving Program, which enables the Red Cross to respond to the needs of individuals and families impacted by disasters anywhere in the United States. In fiscal 2023, the Foundation provided $500,000 to the American Red Cross for the program. In addition to financial support, our restaurants donate meals to feed first responders and victims of natural disasters. The Foundation also provided $250,000 to nonprofit organizations such as Volunteer Florida Foundation to support Hurricane Ian relief and recovery efforts.  In fiscal 2023, the Foundation launched the Next Course Scholarship program to help the children or dependents of Darden team members reach their educational goals. The Foundation has partnered with Scholarship America to administer the initiative, which provided scholarships for post-secondary education to children or dependents of eligible full-time and part-time Darden team members for the 2023-24 academic year. As a result, nearly 100 children or dependents of Darden team members were awarded scholarships worth $3,000 each. These team members represent more than 80 different restaurants across seven of our brands and 32 states.  More information about the Foundation and its efforts to enhance the quality of life in the communities where we do business is available on our website at www.darden.com.  ", "time": "00:00:03"}
