Subsequently, we have approximately $2.1 billion of capacity remaining under this program.  During 2022, we repurchased approximately 21.7 million shares of Class P common stock for $368 million at an average price of $16.94 per share.     Narrative Description of Business   Business Strategy  Our business strategy is to:  \u2022focus on stable, fee-based energy transportation and storage assets that are central to the energy infrastructure and energy transition of growing markets within North America or served by U.S. exports;  \u2022increase utilization of our existing assets while controlling costs, operating safely, and employing environmentally sound operating practices; \u2022exercise discipline in capital allocation and in evaluating expansion projects and acquisition opportunities; \u2022leverage economies of scale from asset expansions and acquisitions that fit within our strategy; and \u2022maintain a strong financial profile and enhance and return value to our stockholders.  It is our intention to carry out the above business strategy, modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances.  However, as discussed under Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d below and at the beginning of this report in \u201cInformation Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out.  We regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and divestitures, and we are currently contemplating potential transactions.  Any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions, and, as applicable, receipt of fairness opinions, and approval of our board of directors.  While there are currently no unannounced purchase or sale agreements for the acquisition or sale of any material business or assets, such transactions can be effected quickly, may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations.  5 5 5    Business Segments  For financial information on our reportable business segments, see Note 16 \u201cReportable Segments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.   Natural Gas Pipelines  Our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment includes interstate and intrastate pipelines, underground storage facilities, our LNG liquefaction and terminal facilities and NGL fractionation facilities, and includes both FERC regulated and non-FERC regulated assets.   Our primary businesses in this segment consist of natural gas transportation, storage, sales, gathering, processing and treating, and various LNG services. \u00a0Within this segment are: (i) approximately 45,000 miles of wholly owned natural gas pipelines and (ii) our equity interests in entities that have approximately 27,000 miles of natural gas pipelines, along with associated storage and supply lines for these transportation networks, which are strategically located throughout the North American natural gas pipeline grid. \u00a0Our transportation network provides access to the major natural gas supply areas and consumers in the western U.S., Rocky Mountain, Midwest, Texas, Louisiana, Southeastern and Northeast regions.  Our LNG terminal facilities also serve natural gas market areas in the southeast.  The following tables summarize our significant Natural Gas Pipelines business segment assets as of December\u00a031, 2022.

For further information regarding Ruby\u2019s bankruptcy filing, see Note 4 \u201cGains and Losses on Divestitures, Impairments and Other Write-downs\u2014Ruby Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing.\u201d  (d)Collectively referred to as Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations. (e)Includes proportionate share of design capacity from our Liberty pipeline joint venture. (f)Asset also has storage capacity of 60 MBbl.  Segment Contracts  Revenues from our interstate natural gas pipelines, related storage facilities and LNG terminals are primarily received under long-term fixed contracts.\u00a0\u00a0To the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors, we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms, with higher per-unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity.\u00a0\u00a0These long-term contracts are typically structured with a fixed fee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available, whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize that capacity. Similarly, our Texas Intrastate natural gas pipeline operations currently derive approximately 77% of its sales and transport margins from long-term transport and sales contracts. As contracts expire, we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, the remaining weighted average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts held by assets we own or have equity interests in (including intrastate pipelines\u2019 sales portfolio) was approximately six years.  Our LNG regasification and liquefaction and associated storage contracts are subscribed under long-term agreements with a weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 12 years.  Our Midstream assets provide natural gas gathering and processing services.  These assets are mostly fee-based, and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas, processing natural gas in order to remove NGL from the natural gas stream, and fractionating NGL into its base components, are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems.  Such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity.  In addition to fee-based arrangements, some of which may include minimum volume commitments, we also provide some services based on percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-index and keep-whole contracts.  Our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement, but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above, which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices.  Segment Competition  The market for natural gas infrastructure is highly competitive, and new pipelines, storage facilities, treating facilities, and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve demand for natural gas in the domestic and export markets served by the pipelines in our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment. \u00a0We compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation, processing, storage and treating services. \u00a0We believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility, availability of alternative forms of energy and reliability of service. \u00a0From time to time, projects are proposed that compete with our existing assets.  Whether or when any such projects would be built, or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability is typically not known.  Shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users, including oil, coal, nuclear and renewables such as hydro, wind and solar power, along with other evolving forms of renewable energy. \u00a0Several factors influence the demand for natural gas, including price changes, the availability of supply, other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather.  8 8 8    Products Pipelines   Our Products Pipelines business segment consists of our refined petroleum products, crude oil and condensate pipelines, and associated terminals, our Southeast terminals, our condensate processing facility and our transmix processing facilities.

(b)Collectively referred to as Bakken Crude assets. 9 9 9    Segment Contracts  The profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business generally is driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services.\u00a0We also have 49 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biodiesel.  The\u00a0transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored.\u00a0\u00a0Demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth, and, with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions, demand tends to be relatively stable.\u00a0\u00a0Because of that, we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines and terminals located in, or that transport to, stable or growing markets and population centers.\u00a0\u00a0The prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index and a FERC index rate.  Our crude, condensate and refined petroleum products transportation services are primarily provided pursuant to (i) either FERC or state tariffs (which do not require contractual commitments) or (ii) long-term contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments.  Where we have long-term contracts, our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term; however, the revenues and earnings we realize from our pipelines and terminals are affected by the volumes of crude oil, refined petroleum products and condensate available to our pipeline systems, which are impacted by the levels of oil and gas drilling activity and product demand in the respective regions that we serve.  Our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components, such as light and heavy naphtha, under a long-term fee-based agreement with a major integrated oil company.  Our crude oil marketing activities generate revenues from the sale and delivery of crude oil and condensate purchased either directly from producers or from others on the open market.  In general, sales prices referenced in underlying purchase and sales contracts are market-based and include pricing differentials for factors such as delivery location or crude oil quality.   Segment Competition  Our Products Pipelines\u2019 pipeline and terminal operations compete against proprietary pipelines and terminals owned and operated by major oil companies, other independent products pipelines and terminals, trucking and marine transportation firms (for short-haul movements of products).  Our transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities.  10 10 10    Terminals  Our Terminals business segment includes the operations of our refined petroleum product, chemical, renewable fuel and other liquid terminal facilities (other than those included in the Products Pipelines business segment) and all of our petroleum coke, metal and ores facilities.\u00a0\u00a0Our terminals are located primarily near large U.S. urban centers.\u00a0\u00a0We believe the location of our facilities and our ability to provide flexibility to customers help attract new and retain existing customers at our terminals and provide expansion opportunities.  We often classify our terminal operations based on the handling of either liquids or dry-bulk material products.  In addition, our Terminals\u2019 marine operations include Jones Act-qualified product tankers that provide marine transportation of crude oil, condensate, refined petroleum products and renewable fuel between U.S. ports.   The following summarizes our Terminals business segment assets, as of December\u00a031, 2022: NumberCapacity(MMBbl)Liquids terminals4777.8Bulk terminals28\u2014\u00a0Jones Act-qualified tankers165.3  Segment Contracts  The factors impacting our Terminals business segment generally differ between liquid and bulk terminals.\u00a0\u00a0Our liquids terminals business generally has long-term contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity.\u00a0\u00a0Thus, similar to our natural gas pipelines business, our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to short-term changes in supply and demand.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the remaining length of the underlying service contracts (which on a weighted average basis is approximately three years), the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported, and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time.  As with our refined petroleum products pipelines transportation business, the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle and/or store, as well as the prices we receive for our services, which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored.\u00a0\u00a0While we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals, the primary products are petroleum coke, metals and ores. \u00a0In addition, the majority of our contracts for this  11 11 11   business contain minimum volume guarantees and/or service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs.\u00a0\u00a0The profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by short-term variation in economic conditions; however, to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum and/or have contracts which are volume-based, we can be sensitive to changing market conditions.\u00a0\u00a0To the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors, we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms, with higher per-unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, weather-related events, including hurricanes, may impact our facilities and access to them and, thus, the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or, in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities, for longer periods.  Our Jones Act-qualified tankers provide marine transportation of crude oil, condensate, refined products and renewable fuel in the U.S. and are primarily operating pursuant to fixed price term charters with major integrated oil companies, major refiners and the U.S. Military Sealift Command.  Segment Competition  We are one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in the U.S., based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity.\u00a0\u00a0Our liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals and terminals owned by oil, chemical, pipeline and refining companies.\u00a0\u00a0Our bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators, terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities, stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminaling services.\u00a0\u00a0In some locations, competitors are smaller, independent operators with lower cost structures.\u00a0\u00a0Our Jones Act-qualified product tankers compete with other Jones Act-qualified vessel fleets.  12 12 12    CO2   Our CO2 business segment produces, transports and markets CO2 for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields.  We also own and operate oil and gas producing fields, and RNG, LNG and landfill GTE facilities.\u00a0\u00a0Our CO2 pipelines and related assets allow us to market a complete package of CO2 supply and transportation services to our customers.

Segment Contracts  The CO2 source and transportation business primarily has third-party contracts with minimum volume requirements, which as of December 31, 2022 had a remaining average contract life of approximately eight years.\u00a0\u00a0CO2 sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed.\u00a0\u00a0Our current sales contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil, but with a floor price.\u00a0\u00a0Beginning in 2022, due to the floor price associated with a significant sales contract no longer being a component of the pricing formula, only a small percentage of our sales contracts will be based on a fixed fee or floor price.  Our success in this portion of the CO2 business segment can be impacted by the demand for CO2. \u00a0In the CO2 business segment\u2019s oil and gas producing activities, we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add.\u00a0\u00a0The revenues we receive from our crude oil and NGL sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products.\u00a0\u00a0Over the long-term, we tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products.\u00a0\u00a0In the shorter term, however, market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management, or hedging, program, in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts, particularly for crude oil.\u00a0\u00a0See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Results of Operations\u2014Segment Earnings Results\u201d for more information on crude oil sales prices.  Segment Competition  Our primary competitors for the sale of CO2 include suppliers that have an ownership interest in McElmo Dome, Bravo Dome and Sheep Mountain CO2 resources.\u00a0\u00a0Our ownership interests in the Central Basin, Cortez and Bravo pipelines are in direct competition with other CO2 pipelines.\u00a0\u00a0We compete with other interest owners in the McElmo Dome unit and the Bravo Dome unit for transportation of CO2 to the Denver City, Texas market area.   Major Customers   Our revenue is derived from a wide customer base. For each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues. We do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  15 15 15    Industry Regulation  Our business operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.  Please read Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Regulation\u201d for discussions of the risks we face related to regulation. For information related to pending regulatory proceedings, see Note 18 \u201cLitigation and Environmental\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.  Interstate Natural Gas Transportation and Storage Regulation  We operate our interstate natural gas pipeline and storage facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC and the provisions of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the Energy Policy Act).  These laws give the FERC authority over the construction and operation of such facilities, including their modification, extension, enlargement and abandonment.    Pursuant to the NGA, the FERC also has authority over the rates charged and terms and conditions of services offered by interstate natural gas pipeline and storage companies.  The FERC\u2019s regulatory authority extends to establishing minimum and maximum rates for services and allows operators to discount or negotiate rates on a non-discriminatory basis.  The rates, terms and conditions of service are set forth in posted tariffs approved by the FERC for each of our interstate natural gas pipeline and storage companies. Posted tariff rates are deemed just and reasonable and cannot be changed without FERC authorization following an evidentiary hearing or settlement.  The FERC can initiate proceedings, on its own initiative or in response to a shipper complaint, that could result in a rate change or confirm existing rates.  Negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of agreed-upon rates during the term of the transportation agreement, regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates.  Negotiated rate agreements must be filed with the FERC or included in summary form in the pipeline\u2019s tariff.    FERC regulations also include a comprehensive framework for market transparency and nondiscrimination, as well as the FERC\u2019s prohibition against market manipulation.  Under the Energy Policy Act and related regulations, it is unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, to engage in fraudulent conduct.  FERC Standards of Conduct regulate, among other things, the manner in which interstate natural gas pipelines may interact with their marketing affiliates.  The FERC\u2019s market oversight and transparency regulations require annual reports of purchases or sales of natural gas meeting certain thresholds and criteria and certain public postings of information on scheduled volumes.   The FERC has authority to impose civil penalties of more than $1.3 million per day per violation.  Should we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and orders administered by the FERC, we could be subject to substantial civil penalties and fines.  In addition to having jurisdiction over interstate natural gas pipelines and storage companies, the FERC also has jurisdiction over the interstate transportation and storage services that are provided by intrastate pipelines and storage companies under Section 311 of the NGPA.  We have numerous intrastate pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA.  Under Section 311, along with the FERC\u2019s implementing regulations, an intrastate pipeline may transport gas \u201con behalf of\u201d an interstate pipeline company or any local distribution company served by an interstate pipeline, without becoming subject to the FERC\u2019s broader regulatory authority under the NGA.  These services must be provided on an open and nondiscriminatory basis, and the rates charged for these services may not exceed a \u201cfair and equitable\u201d level as determined by the FERC in periodic rate proceedings.    Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation  Some of our U.S. refined petroleum products and crude oil gathering and transmission pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines, subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA.  The ICA requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the FERC.  Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing gathering or transportation services on our interstate common liquids carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services.  The ICA requires, among other things, that rates on interstate common liquids carrier pipelines be \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d and nondiscriminatory.  The ICA permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates.  If, upon completion of an investigation, the FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund to shippers the difference between the revenues collected during the pendency of the investigation and the revenues that would have been collected based on the rate the FERC finds to be just and reasonable.  The FERC also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively.  Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint. 16 16 16    Petroleum products and crude oil pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index.  Shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels, but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline\u2019s increase in costs from the previous year.  Generally, a petroleum products or crude oil pipeline will utilize the FERC\u2019s indexing methodology to adjust its rates, as indexing serves as the default rate-adjustment mechanism.  Cost-of-service based rates, market-based rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the default indexing mechanism and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates.  CPUC Rate Regulation  The intrastate common carrier operations of our refined products pipelines in California are subject to regulation by the CPUC under a \u201cdepreciated book plant\u201d methodology, which is based on an original cost measure of investment.  Intrastate tariffs filed by us with the CPUC have been established on the basis of revenues, expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the California intrastate portion of the refined products operations\u2019 business.  Tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in California are subject to challenge by protest by interested parties or by independent action of the CPUC.  Railroad Commission of Texas (RCT) Rate Regulation  The intrastate operations of our crude oil and liquids pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in Texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the RCT.  The RCT has the authority to regulate our rates, though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints.  Mexico - Energy Regulatory Commission  The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the Energy Regulatory Commission of Mexico (the Commission) that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service.  This permit expires in 2026, subject to an additional 15-year renewal term.  This permit establishes certain restrictive conditions, including without limitation: (i) compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service; (ii) compliance with certain safety measures, contingency plans, maintenance plans and the official standards of Mexico regarding safety; (iii) compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the Commission; (iv) compliance with certain technical studies established by the Commission; and (v) compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10% of the investment proposed in the project.  Mexico - National Agency for Industrial and Operational Safety and Environmental Protection (ASEA)  ASEA regulates environmental compliance and industrial and operational safety.  The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline must satisfy and maintain ASEA\u2019s requirements, including compliance with certain safety measures, contingency plans, maintenance plans and the official standards of Mexico regarding safety, including a Safety Administration Program.  The main environmental authorization for the operation of the pipeline is the Environmental Impact Authorization.  The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline authorization expires at the end of March 2023, and is currently in the process of being renewed.  Pipeline Safety Regulation  We are also subject to pipeline safety regulations issued by PHMSA as well as any states that are certified by PHMSA to regulate pipeline safety for intrastate pipes in their respective states.  These regulations apply to pipelines and pipeline facilities, including associated underground natural gas storage, terminals, and liquefied natural gas facilities.  PHMSA regulations in particular, require us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to evaluate our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as High Consequence Areas (HCAs) for both gas and liquid pipelines and Moderate Consequence Areas (MCAs) for gas pipelines, where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.  In the past several years, PHMSA has passed several new rules that impose additional pipeline safety requirements including without limitation:  (i) expanding certain integrity management program requirements outside of HCAs (with some exceptions) for both gas and hazardous liquid pipelines;  (ii) requiring reconfirmation of the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) by 2035 on certain gas pipelines; (iii) installation of remote control or automatic shut-off valves (or alternative equivalent technology) on certain newly constructed or replaced gas pipelines; (iv) increasing requirements for  17 17 17   corrosion control; and (v) providing additional prescriptive requirements that increase conservatism and specificity on the evaluation of discovered anomalies and their associated repair criteria.  OSHA  We are also subject to the requirements of federal and state agencies, including, where appropriate, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), that address, among other things, employee health and safety.  State and Local Regulation  Certain of our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, pollution, pipeline safety, protection of the environment, and human health and safety.  Marine Operations  The operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property, personnel and cargo under General Maritime Law. These obligations create a variety of risks including, among other things, the risk of collision, which may result in claims for personal injury, cargo, contract, pollution, third-party claims and property damages to vessels and facilities.  We are subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation (between U.S. departure and destination points) to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and crewed by U.S. citizens. As a result, we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock and under certain circumstances consistent with our certificate of incorporation, we have the right to redeem shares of our common stock owned by non-U.S. citizens. If we do not comply with such requirements, we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for our vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels. Furthermore, from time to time, legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in the U.S. Congress to amend the Jones Act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between U.S. ports be built and registered in the U.S. and owned and crewed by U.S. citizens.\u00a0\u00a0If the Jones Act were amended in such fashion, we could face competition from foreign-flagged vessels.  In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard and the American Bureau of Shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world, which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for U.S.-flag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience. The Jones Act and General Maritime Law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness.  The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is a federal law that provides the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, upon proclamation by the U.S. President of a national emergency or a threat to the national security, the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by U.S. citizens (including us, provided that we are considered a U.S. citizen for this purpose). If one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the U.S. government under this law, we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire. However, we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition.  Derivatives Regulation  We use energy commodity derivative contracts as part of our strategy to hedge our exposure to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business.  The derivative contracts that we use include exchange-traded and OTC commodity financial instruments such as futures and options contracts, fixed price swaps and basis swaps.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the OTC derivatives market and entities that participate in that market.  In October 2020, the CFTC finalized one of the last remaining new rules pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that institutes broad new aggregate position limits for OTC swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges.  As finalized, these rules include exemptions for hedging positions.  18 18 18    Environmental Matters  Our business operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety.  For example, if a leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions, and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak, release or spill, pay government penalties, address natural resource damages, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures.  Furthermore, new projects may require permits, approvals and environmental analyses under federal and state laws, including the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, as well as Executive Orders focused on environmental justice considerations.  The resulting costs and liabilities could be material to us, and increasing compliance costs under federal and state environmental laws for both new and existing facilities could require us to make significant capital expenditures.  In general, the cost of environmental control at facilities is increasing and limiting the return on capital projects and the number of capital projects that are viable.  Please read Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Regulation.\u201d  In accordance with GAAP, we record liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.  For information related to pending environmental matters, including our accruals of environmental reserves, see Note 18 \u201cLitigation and Environmental\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.  Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste  We generate both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state statutes.  RCRA establishes standards for the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes.    Superfund  The CERCLA or the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  CERCLA authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur, including remediation costs.  Additionally, CERCLA allows for the recovery of compensation for natural resource damages, if any.  Although petroleum is excluded from CERCLA\u2019s definition of a hazardous substance, in the course of our ordinary operations, we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of \u201chazardous substance.\u201d  By operation of law, if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to evaluate and remediate sites at which such materials are present, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.  Clean Air Act  Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, its implementing regulations, and analogous state statutes and regulations.  The EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act contain requirements for the monitoring, reporting, and control of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from stationary sources.   For further information, see \u201c\u2014Climate Change\u201d below.  Clean Water Act  Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of fills and pollutants into waters of the U.S.  The discharge of fills and pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal or state authorities.  The Oil Pollution Act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the Clean Water Act pertaining to prevention of and response to oil spills.  Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of the Clean Water Act and some state laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil.  EPA Revisions to Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)  As required by the Clean Air Act, the EPA establishes National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for how much pollution is permissible, and the states then have to adopt rules so their air quality meets the NAAQS.  In October 2015, the  19 19 19   EPA published a rule lowering the ground level ozone NAAQS from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to a more stringent 70 ppb standard.  This change triggered a process under which the EPA designated the areas of the country in or out of compliance with the 2015 standards.  In December 2020, EPA completed a review of the ozone NAAQS and published a rule retaining the 2015 standards.  State rules implementing the NAAQS, including those existing or proposed in Colorado and New Mexico, require the installation of more stringent air pollution controls on newly-installed equipment and possibly require the retrofitting of existing KMI facilities with air pollution controls.  These rules will have financial impacts to our Natural Gas Business Unit.  Future state rules could have financial impacts on multiple business units.  Climate Change  Due to concern over climate change, numerous proposals to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the federal, state and local levels of government.  Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and CO2, which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of burning natural gas, are examples of GHGs.  Various laws and regulations exist or are under development to regulate the emission of such GHGs, including the EPA programs to report GHG emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs. The U.S. Congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs.    Beginning in 2009, EPA published several findings and rulemakings under the Clean Air Act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain GHGs, including CO2 and methane.  Certain of our facilities are subject to these requirements.  Operational or physical changes to existing facilities could require those facilities to comply with these requirements.  In addition, proposed regulatory changes, if enacted, would require almost all existing oil and natural gas facilities to reduce GHG emissions.  At the state level, more than one-third of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, such as through establishment of GHG reduction targets or regional GHG \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs.  It is possible that sources such as our gas-fueled compressors and processing plants could become subject to these state GHG reduction regulations.  Various states are also proposing or have implemented stricter regulations for reporting, monitoring or reducing GHGs that go beyond the requirements of the EPA.   Compliance with state rules could require additional expenditures, above and beyond those spent to comply with the November 2021 proposed EPA GHG rules for new and existing sources.  Because our operations, including the compressor stations and processing plants, emit various types of GHGs, primarily methane and CO2, such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining our facilities.  Depending on the particular law, regulation or program, we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment or emission controls on the facilities, acquire and surrender allowances for the GHG emissions, pay taxes related to the GHG emissions and administer and manage a more comprehensive GHG emissions program.  We are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, as is the case with similarly situated companies in our industry, they could be significant to us.  While we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries\u2019 pipelines, recovery of costs is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or other regulatory bodies, and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations.  Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.  Because the combustion of natural gas produces lower GHG emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels, cap-and-trade legislation or EPA regulatory initiatives to reduce GHGs could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of competing fuels such as coal and oil.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, we anticipate that GHG regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies, such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our CO2 business segment.\u00a0\u00a0However, these potential positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing non-fossil fuels.\u00a0\u00a0Although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts, GHG regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Department of Homeland Security  The Department of Homeland Security, referred to in this report as the DHS, has regulatory authority over security at certain high-risk chemical facilities.  The DHS has promulgated the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards and required all high-risk chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities, to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards.  This process includes completing security vulnerability assessments, developing site security plans, and implementing protective measures necessary to meet DHS-defined, risk-based performance standards.  The DHS has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule; therefore, neither the extent to  20 20 20   which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined, but it is possible that such costs could be substantial.  Cybersecurity  In response to ongoing cybersecurity threats affecting the pipeline industry, the DHS\u2019s Transportation Safety Administration, or TSA, has issued a series of security directives setting forth specific elements that all pipeline owners and operators must include in their cybersecurity planning and their reporting of any incidents.  These security directives require, among other things, that pipeline owners comply with mandatory reporting measures; designate a cybersecurity coordinator; provide vulnerability assessments; ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements; establish and implement a TSA-approved Cybersecurity Implementation Plan; develop and maintain a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan; and establish a Cybersecurity Assessment Program, and submit an annual plan that describes how owners will assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures.    In addition, PHMSA requires reporting of any event that involves a release from or the shutdown of a pipeline, including because of a cyber-attack.  The SEC has issued guidance outlining its position on cybersecurity disclosure requirements that apply under federal securities laws, but new binding rules imposing affirmative reporting requirements were proposed in March 2022 and are expected to be finalized in 2023.  Also under development is the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), a law concerning the reporting of cyber incidents and ransomware payments that was signed into law in early 2022 and is expected to take effect in early 2024.   Human Capital  In managing our human capital resources, we use a strategic approach to building a diverse, inclusive, and respectful workplace.  Our human resources department provides expertise and tools to attract, develop, and retain diverse talent and support our employees\u2019 career and development goals.  Our leadership teams have plans in place to enhance diversity and equality of opportunity in hiring, development, and promotions.  We value our employees\u2019 opinions and encourage them to engage with management and ask questions on topics such as our goals, challenges and employee concerns.  We employed 10,525 full-time personnel at December\u00a031, 2022, including approximately 888 full-time hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2023 and 2027.  We consider relations with our employees to be good.  We value the safety of our workforce and integrate a culture of safety, emergency preparedness and environmental responsibility through our operations management system (OMS).  Our OMS conforms to common industry standards and establishes a framework that helps us (i) provide employees and contractors with a safe work environment; (ii) comply with laws, rules, regulations, policies, and procedures; and (iii) identify opportunities to improve.  Although our ultimate target is zero incidents, we also have three non-zero employee safety performance targets as follows: Non-zero employee safety performance target2022 Company-wide TRIR (excluding COVID-19 cases)Outperform the annual industry average total recordable incident rate (TRIR)1.9 (0.8)Outperform our own three-year TRIR averageImprove our company-wide employee TRIR from 1.0 in the baseline year 2019 to 0.7 by 2024 Non-zero employee safety performance target 2022 Company-wide TRIR (excluding COVID-19 cases) Outperform the annual industry average total recordable incident rate (TRIR) 1.9 (0.8)  We seek to constantly improve our contractor TRIR performance through initiatives to address recent incident trends and new best practices.  Our board of directors\u2019 nominating and governance committee is responsible for planning for succession in the senior management ranks of the Company, including the office of chief executive officer.  The chief executive officer shall report to the committee, generally at the time of the regularly scheduled third quarter board of directors meeting in each year, regarding the processes in place to identify talent within and outside the Company to succeed to senior management positions and the information developed during the current calendar year pursuant to those processes.  As part of our annual succession planning process, we identify minority and female candidates to include in the plan for senior positions.  Management reviews its succession plan, including a discussion on development opportunities for potential successors, with the nominating and governance committee of our board of directors annually.  21 21 21   We consider employee diversity an asset and support equal opportunity employment.  We take affirmative steps to employ and advance in employment all persons without regard to their race/ethnicity; sex; sexual orientation; gender, including gender identity and expression; veteran status; disability; or other protected categories, and base employment decisions solely on valid job requirements.  We are committed to a harassment free workplace, supported with online and face-to-face workplace harassment and discrimination prevention training for our employees.  Employees and supervisors review our harassment and discrimination prevention policy every two years as part of our policy renewal training.  Our employees are an integral part of our success, and we value their career development.  We encourage and support professional development and learning for our employees by offering workforce training, tuition reimbursement, leadership and other development programs.  These programs help improve recruitment, development, and retention.  We support our employees\u2019 ongoing career goals and development through several programs.  These programs help maximize our employees\u2019 potential and give them the skills they need to further enhance their careers.  Our compensation program is linked to long- and short-term strategic financial and operational objectives, including environmental, safety, and compliance targets.  Compensation includes competitive base salaries in the markets in which we operate and competitive benefits, including retirement plans, opportunities for annual bonuses, and, for eligible employees, long-term incentives and an employee stock purchase plan.   Properties and Rights-of-Way  We believe we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses, subject to liens for current taxes, liens incident to minor encumbrances, and easements and restrictions, which do not materially detract from the value of such property, the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses.\u00a0\u00a0Our terminals, storage facilities, treating and processing plants, regulator and compressor stations, oil and gas wells, offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us.\u00a0\u00a0In some cases, the real property we lease is on federal, state or local government land.  We generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, we obtain and maintain rights to construct and operate the pipelines on other people\u2019s land generally under agreements that are perpetual or provide for renewal rights.\u00a0\u00a0Substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights-of-way granted by the apparent record owners of such property.\u00a0\u00a0In many instances, lands over which rights-of-way have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right-of-way grants.\u00a0\u00a0In some cases, not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the right-of-way grants, but in substantially all such cases, signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained.\u00a0\u00a0Permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under, or to lay facilities in or along, water courses, county roads, municipal streets and state highways, and in some instances, such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor, or, the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense.\u00a0\u00a0Permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rights-of-way, many of which are also revocable at the grantor\u2019s election.\u00a0\u00a0Some such permits require annual or other periodic payments.\u00a0\u00a0In a few minor cases, property for pipeline purposes was purchased by the Company.
