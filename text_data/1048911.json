References to our transportation segments include, collectively, the FedEx Express segment, the FedEx Ground segment, and the FedEx Freight segment. \u00a0 One FedEx and Network 2.0 \u00a0 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced \u201cone FedEx\u201d, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight will continue to provide LTL freight transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under Federal Express Corporation. The organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.  \u00a0 We have announced the implementation of Network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, FedEx will continue to utilize both employees and contracted service providers. See \u201cBusiness Segments\u201d below, \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information on one FedEx, Network 2.0, and DRIVE. \u00a0 Strategy  \u00a0 The collective FedEx brand gives us our competitive edge. Further, our strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio, in the long-term best interest of the enterprise. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. We focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. Our business strategy also provides flexibility in structuring our network to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility, uncertainty, and evolution have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy.   Over the last 50 years, we built networks that have created a differentiated and unmatched portfolio of services while continuously evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers and the market. We made significant investments in our service network in recent years to build out our infrastructure and services to meet increased e-commerce demand. Through one FedEx and Network 2.0, we are building a simplified experience to better serve our customers with enhanced capabilities and transforming to operate with more flexibility, efficiency, and intelligence. One FedEx and Network 2.0 will leverage the strength of our networks, people, and assets in more efficient ways, enabling a distinct focus on air and international volume while facilitating a more holistic approach to how we move packages on the ground.   Innovation inspired our start at FedEx 50 years ago, and it is fueling our future as we combine logistics with digital intelligence. Leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks, developments in data and technology are facilitating the execution of our DRIVE transformation by creating new opportunities to improve our operational efficiency by optimizing our existing physical capacity and staffing. See \u201cBusiness Segments\u201d below for more information. Additionally, the size and scale of our global network gives us key insights into global supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use to build better insights, improve the customer experience, and differentiate our service offering. To fully harness the power of this data, FedEx Dataworks is focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and our customers\u2019 supply chains, as well as the end-to-end experience of our customers.    \u201cSafety Above All\u201d is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. We are committed to making our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers, and the public. This philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through rigorous policies, continual education and engagement, and investments in technology designed to prevent accidents.   Through our global transportation, information technology, and retail networks, we help to facilitate an ongoing and unprecedented expansion of customer access \u2014 to goods, services, and information. We believe it would be extremely difficult, costly, and time-consuming to replicate our global network, which reflects decades of investment, innovation, and expertise, includes the world\u2019s largest all-cargo air fleet, and connects more than 99% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product. We continue to position our company and team members to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity, and profitability.   - 3 - \u00a0 During 2023 and early 2024, we introduced and expanded a number of innovative solutions, advanced important long-term business initiatives, and made other important investments that benefit our customers, team members, communities, and other stakeholders, including: \u00a0 \u0095    Launching DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve our long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada. \u00a0 \u0095    Announcing one FedEx, our consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network. \u00a0 \u0095    Expanding Picture Proof of Delivery to 90% of global residential deliveries. \u00a0 \u0095    Improving service at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground through the reopening and completion of intra-European road hubs and continued enhancements to route optimization and package handler scheduling technologies. \u00a0 \u0095    Offering FedEx Consolidated Returns in the U.S., a low-priced, customer-friendly e-commerce returns option facilitated through supply chain services offered by FedEx Logistics and FedEx Office. \u00a0 \u0095    Introducing FedEx Sustainability Insights in the U.S., a cloud-based engine that harnesses scan data from our global logistics network to enhance customer access to emissions information. \u00a0 \u0095    Exceeding our FedEx Cares 50 by 50 goal of positively impacting 50 million people around the world by our 50th anniversary in April 2023. Reputation and Responsibility  \u00a0 FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2023, FedEx ranked 18th  in FORTUNE magazine\u2019s \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Admired Companies\u201d list \u2014 the 23rd consecutive year FedEx has ranked among the top 20 in the FORTUNE Most Admired Companies list, with 15 of those years ranking among the top 10. We also retained our position as the highest ranked delivery company on the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Admired Companies\u201d list. Additionally, in 2023 Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, named FedEx as one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies\u00ae.  \u00a0 Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. For example, in 2023 FedEx was named the 21st best workplace overall in FORTUNE magazine\u2019s list of the \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Workplaces.\u201d  \u00a0 The success of our efforts is built on our sound ESG practices, which are aligned with our strategic focus. Our 2023 ESG Report is available at fedex.com/en-us/sustainability/reports.html. This report details progress toward our ESG strategies, goals, and initiatives and our approach toward industry leadership in ESG to support our strategy and values. Information in our ESG Report is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report. \u00a0 We remain committed to helping lift local economies by investing in people and communities where we live and work. In the U.S., this includes seeking diverse suppliers and strengthening our supply chain by sourcing from small, minority-, and women-owned businesses. We are also proud of our long-standing history of supporting and fostering relationships with organizations that are working to make our society more equitable and just, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Civil Rights Museum.  Human Resource Management \u00a0 Our Culture   At FedEx, it is our people\u2014our greatest asset\u2014that stand at the heart of our success and are the foundation of our strong reputation. Our exemplary human network defines who we are and what kind of business we want to be. Ultimately, our success depends on our people\u2019s talent, dedication, and well-being. We strive to recruit, retain, develop, and support our team members as we grow globally. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and discusses with management our key human resource management strategies and programs, including company culture and diversity, equity, and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d). - 4 - \u00a0   Throughout our 50-year history, the FedEx culture has driven our success. Our five culture values\u2014take care of each other, commit to do good, drive business results, own outstanding, and create what\u2019s next\u2014unify all our operating companies and empower us to support our strategy and values. These values are grounded in our Quality Driven Management system, the Purple Promise to make every FedEx experience outstanding, and our People\u2013Service\u2013Profit philosophy, which we bring to life by:  \u00a0 \u0095     Prioritizing safety. \u0095     Taking care of our team members. \u0095     Embracing DEI so everyone feels appreciated and valued. \u0095     Delivering excellence and value for our customers and stockholders. \u0095     Acting with integrity in all that we do. \u0095     Supporting our communities. \u0095     Helping shape a better world. \u0095     Growing profitably to reinvest in our team members and business. Ultimately, our success depends on the talent, dedication, and well-being of our people. As we grow, we strive to recruit, retain, develop, and provide advancement opportunities for our team members. We continually work to make FedEx an inclusive, equitable, and growth-focused workplace where all team members have the opportunity to flourish. \u00a0 Health and Safety   Our highest priority is the well-being, health, and safety of all our employees. Our \u201cSafety Above All\u201d philosophy is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business and is key to maintaining a successful and safe business. Our detailed safety policies, education, and technology investments are embedded into our day-to-day work and help us follow through on our commitment to make our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers, and communities. The Governance, Safety, and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our safety strategies, policies, programs, and practices.  \u00a0 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Creates Opportunity   We believe that DEI delivers a better future for all team members, customers, suppliers, and communities. As a global business, we value the diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences of our people and recognize DEI is essential to our success and the communities we serve. DEI fosters collaboration, enables us to recruit, retain, and develop a talented workforce, and underpins our business performance and sustainability. The continued integration of DEI into our business strategies and progress towards our DEI objectives supported our ability to respond to the challenging labor market our industry faced in recent years.   FedEx has a long-standing commitment to fully embrace DEI throughout our organization, from the Board of Directors to every employee. This commitment is communicated through our DEI framework and four strategic pillars: Our People; Our Education and Engagement; Our Communities, Customers, and Suppliers; and Our Story. We continue to roll out programs to ensure our people are engaged and can develop at FedEx. The FedEx Ground workforce career track program, Purple Pathways, directly targets our most diverse population, frontline managers and package handlers, to support their career growth.   To further our transparency efforts regarding our workforce composition, we report the prior year\u2019s gender, racial, and ethnic composition of our U.S. workforce by EEO-1 job category, as set forth in the consolidated EEO-1 Reports filed by FedEx and its operating subsidiaries with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. These reports can be found on our DEI webpage at fedex.com/en-us/about/diversity-inclusion.html. \u00a0 Quality of Life   To support the well-being of our employees and their families, we provide the resources they need to thrive at work and at home. All eligible full- and part-time team members are equipped with competitive benefits, including healthcare, wellness, paid sick leave, other flexible paid time off, and other benefits. To ensure our benefits and compensation stay competitive, we conduct periodic peer benchmarking and internal pay equity analyses. \u00a0 \u00a0 - 5 - \u00a0 \u00a0 All eligible full- and part-time employees and their eligible dependents receive competitive health benefits. In the U.S., we cover approximately 70% of total eligible health and disability costs at the plan level for approximately 212,000 participating employees as of May 2023. Additionally, we offer competitive time-off that is based on feedback from our team members about what is important to them, and provide 24/7 confidential counseling services to support the mental health and well-being of our employees and their household members. We frequently communicate with employees on how to access these resources to promote their use across the enterprise, with an increased focus on mental health resources in recent years. \u00a0 Learning and Development   At FedEx, we are committed to helping our team members grow and further develop their careers. We proactively evolve our operating companies\u2019 learning frameworks to meet emerging trends and align existing competencies to future capabilities and skillsets to future-proof talent needs. Our learning and development opportunities increase team member engagement, improve retention, and enhance the employee value proposition. Across the enterprise, we tailor our Core New Employee Orientation to best fit team member responsibilities in their local workplace. This onboarding experience covers topics such as safety, security, compliance, sustainability, and DEI. After orientation, the FedEx Learning Center is available with more than 25,000 online courses to enable a more efficient and convenient learning experience.   We are committed to supporting team members who wish to pursue higher education in a variety of ways. The Learning inspired by FedEx (LiFE) program \u2014 a partnership between multiple FedEx operating companies and The University of Memphis\u2014offers a suite of education benefits, including tuition-free, fully online degree options for over 30 associate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s programs of study. Eligible employees include all FedEx Express employees at all hub and airport locations in the U.S. as well as all U.S.-based FedEx Logistics and FedEx Freight employees and all Memphis-based FedEx Supply Chain employees. In 2022, we expanded the LiFE program to include all majors The University of Memphis offers online and added mentoring opportunities. We are exploring opportunities to implement similar programs outside the U.S.   Talent Acquisition, Engagement, and Turnover   Our recruiting practices enable us to build a talented employee base representative of the communities we serve. We continue to refine our approach to talent acquisition through technology and other human resource management strategies, leveraging technology to make our hiring process more efficient. We value feedback from our team members and provide several avenues of engagement, such as annual surveys, employee networks, and direct feedback. These methods allow us to better understand employee concerns and expectations, and results from these engagements inform our future strategies. Annually, we conduct an engagement survey to measure employee insights on our culture, engagement, and diversity.   We work to provide employees with flexible work structures. Depending on the operating company and team member responsibilities, we use a flexible work model that allows our people to work in ways that make the most sense to them. We are constantly monitoring and adjusting our strategy as we learn of new developments and use survey data at the local, national, and enterprise levels to inform our strategy.    Globally, in 2022, we hired over 558,000 full- and part-time team members. Turnover for part-time team members, primarily package handlers at our sorting locations, was 205%, while full-time team member turnover was 32% in 2023. Turnover rates among part-time frontline workers in a number of industries are historically higher than among other employee groups. Within the ground transportation industry, many part-time workers pursue temporary employment opportunities that allow them to exit and re-enter the workforce more frequently based on their needs. These traditionally higher rates have recently been further exacerbated by the highly competitive labor market.   Other Information   As of May 31, 2023, FedEx employed approximately 328,000 permanent full-time and approximately 201,000 permanent part-time employees, and FedEx Ground utilized nearly 7,000 contracted service providers.   The pilots at FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (\u201cALPA\u201d) and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect on November 2, 2015. The agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 the National Mediation Board (\u201cNMB\u201d) began actively mediating the negotiations. In May 2023, FedEx Express reached a tentative successor agreement with ALPA. The tentative agreement was approved by ALPA\u2019s FedEx Express Master Executive Council in June 2023 and is being presented to FedEx Express\u2019s pilots for ratification during the first quarter of 2024. The ongoing ratification process has no effect on our operations. - 6 - \u00a0   A small number of our other employees are members of unions. For additional information, see \u201cFedEx Express Segment\u201d and \u201cRegulation\u201d below and \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d \u00a0 Our Community  \u00a0 FedEx is committed to actively supporting the communities we serve worldwide through the strategic investment of our people, resources, and network. Through FedEx Cares, our global community engagement program, we support non-profit organizations working to solve social challenges relevant to our business, customers, and team members. We pair donations with charitable shipping and access to our global network, team member volunteers, subject matter expertise, influence, and connections to meet social and business goals. We make our biggest investments in areas where we can address significant issues and apply our unique business capabilities. Real change takes significant investment, authentic support for communities, and a commitment to continuous learning. FedEx Cares focuses on three major giving pillars: \u00a0 \u0095   Delivering for Good: Lending our global network and unparalleled logistics expertise to organizations with mission-critical needs in times of disaster and helping communities heal, learn, and thrive.  \u00a0 \u0095    Global Entrepreneurship: Advancing women and minority-owned small businesses globally through training and increased access to resources, capital, and new markets. \u00a0 \u0095    Sustainable Logistics: Accelerating process innovations such as public transportation and technological innovations such as natural carbon capture and clean energy to reduce the environmental impact of the logistics industry.  \u00a0 Additionally, our commitments to DEI and team member volunteerism are foundational to FedEx Cares. \u00a0 In 2023 we exceeded our FedEx Cares 50 by 50 goal of positively impacting 50 million people around the world by our 50th anniversary in April 2023. We also launched a \u201c50 Days of Caring\u201d initiative leading up to the anniversary during which FedEx team members gave back to their communities through service projects around the world and created the FedEx Founder\u2019s Fund \u2014 a philanthropic endowment honoring Frederick W. Smith and his legacy as a business leader and changemaker in communities around the world. Additionally, FedEx supports communities throughout the U.S. with its FedEx Cares Employee Giving program.  \u00a0 We believe the investments we make in our communities today, combined with team member engagement, set the stage for a brighter tomorrow. For additional information on our community involvement and our FedEx Cares strategy, visit fedexcares.com. \u00a0 The Environment  \u00a0 Our \u201cPractical Sustainability\u201d philosophy and \u201cReduce, Replace, Revolutionize\u201d approach guide our sustainability strategy. At FedEx, we recognize our business\u2019s effect on the environment and communities we serve, including greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) criteria air pollutant emissions, noise pollution, and waste generation from packaging, and remain steadfast in our commitment to minimize these impacts. We are also cognizant of the effect climate change could have on our business operations. In our business planning and strategy, we consider events such as intensified weather, GHG emissions regulations, increased media and investor attention, and enhanced customer demands to address environmental challenges. FedEx has 50 years of experience proactively addressing unexpected situations, such as severe weather events, and we maintain system flexibility to minimize impacts on our customers. While climate change poses a strategic risk to our business and stakeholders, we recognize the opportunities it simultaneously creates around sustainable products and services that advance our customers\u2019 environmental goals.  \u00a0 We align our assessment and reporting approach with the recommendations from the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Our approach is informed by the climate-related physical and transition risks we identify through our enterprise risk management process. Climate change-related risks and opportunities are assessed as part of our annual risk assessment process, and we continue to closely monitor public attitudes, geopolitical concerns, and global regulations. \u00a0 In 2021 we announced our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by calendar 2040 across our global operations\u2019 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and our Scope 3 contracted transportation emissions. To help reach this goal, we designated $2.0 billion of initial investment towards vehicle electrification, sustainable energy, and carbon sequestration, including a pledge of $100 million to Yale University to help establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture. In addition, we continue to leverage other approaches to reduce aircraft and vehicle emissions, such as increased interline usage at FedEx Express and intermodal rail usage at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. \u00a0 - 7 - \u00a0 Vehicle Electrification \u00a0 Electrifying a substantial portion of our global fleet of motorized vehicles is a crucial component of our path to carbon-neutral operations. We plan to transition the entire FedEx parcel pickup-and-delivery fleet to zero-tailpipe emissions electric vehicles by calendar 2040, using a phased approach to replace existing vehicles. For example, by calendar 2025, we expect 50% of FedEx Express global pickup-and-delivery vehicle purchases will be electric, rising to 100% of all purchases by calendar 2030, subject to availability.  \u00a0 FedEx Express continues to expand its electric vehicle fleet through its relationship with General Motors\u2019 BrightDrop, and has taken delivery of 500 BrightDrop electric vehicles as of June 2023. FedEx Ground is developing a comprehensive strategy to facilitate the electric vehicle transition for our independent service providers, and is implementing the necessary infrastructure at our facilities to provide charging solutions. Additionally, FedEx Freight is evaluating electric vehicle opportunities to define scalable solutions for its entire fleet. \u00a0 We are actively building the innovative charging infrastructure required to support our growing fleet of electric vehicles across our vast network of facilities, and continue to electrify forklifts, airport ground service equipment, and other non-road vehicles across our operating companies to reduce fuel and maintenance costs. We understand that challenges remain, including electric vehicle availability, electrification of certain vehicle classes due to operational needs, legislative changes, grid capacity, and certain operating conditions. For more information, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.  \u00a0 Fleet efficiency enables ongoing fuel, emissions, and cost reductions as the industry works to address these challenges. FedEx Express has established a goal to increase vehicle fleet efficiency by 50% from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2025. Through 2022, our efforts collectively resulted in a 40% improvement in FedEx Express vehicle fleet efficiency from our 2005 baseline.  \u00a0 Sustainable Fuels \u00a0 To reduce aircraft and vehicle emissions, we continue to pursue viable, cost-effective alternative fuels. Our global fleet of over 6,200 alternative fuel vehicles includes hybrid, electric, liquified or compressed natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and we will continue to grow our alternative fuel fleet in the coming years, subject to availability. Decarbonizing heavyweight transportation is more challenging than parcel pickup-and-delivery vehicles due to the required mileage range and the time needed to refuel or charge. We continue to explore alternative fuels for certain vehicles not easily electrifiable.  \u00a0 We have also established a goal of obtaining 30% of our annual jet fuel usage from blends of alternative fuels by calendar 2030. The U.S. government has passed legislation in recent years to incentivize production, and the EU recently adopted legislation implementing sustainable aviation fuel mandates. We understand the challenges the industry faces in deploying sustainable aviation fuel at scale and recognize other solutions may be needed to help the aviation industry improve efficiency and reduce emissions. To help accelerate solutions, we are members of the First Movers Coalition, participating in the Aviation Sector working group, a global initiative working to decarbonize hard-to-abate industrial sectors, including the aviation industry. \u00a0 Aircraft Fuel Conservation and Fleet Modernization \u00a0 We continuously work to reduce the environmental impact of our aircraft fleet. Since 2005, we reduced our overall aircraft emissions intensity by 28%, primarily due to our ongoing FedEx Fuel Sense and aircraft modernization initiatives. Our global FedEx Fuel Sense program, which accounted for 13 million gallons of jet fuel savings in 2022, enables us to reduce the cost of fuel use and associated GHG emissions.  \u00a0 Additionally, our commitment to modernizing our aircraft fleet lowers costs, enhances reliability and operational adaptability, improves fuel efficiency, and reduces emissions intensity. During 2023, we retired our MD-10-30 fleet and accelerated the retirement of our MD-11 fleet to the end of 2028. See the \u201cResults of Operations and Outlook \u2014 Consolidated Results \u2014 Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\u201d section of \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information on aircraft retirements during 2023.  \u00a0 We took delivery of two Boeing 777 Freighter (\u201cB777F\u201d) aircraft in 2023, and plan to deploy an additional six B777F aircraft during 2024 and 2025. Similarly, we took delivery of 14 Boeing 767-300 Freighter (\u201cB767F\u201d) aircraft in 2023, and plan to deploy an additional 24 B767F aircraft during 2024 and 2025. Delays could impact these timelines. We also continue to deploy new ATR 72-600F aircraft for shorter feeder routes to replace our aging ATR-42 aircraft and Cessna SkyCourier 408 cargo aircraft to help reduce the number of planes needed per feeder route and further improve our fuel efficiency. For more information about our expected future aircraft deliveries, see \u201cItem 2. Properties\u201d of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cFedEx Express Segment\u201d and Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. \u00a0 - 8 - \u00a0 Facilities \u00a0 We aim to continuously improve the sustainability, reduce the environmental impact, and increase the efficiency of our more than 5,000 air and ground hubs, local stations, freight service centers, and retail locations. While our energy demand is increasing to support electric vehicle deployment and charging infrastructure, we have increased our focus on facility energy management and off-site renewable energy procurement strategies to overcome this challenge. Energy management systems are essential to increasing efficiency at our facilities through monitoring, regulating, and optimizing our lighting, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning equipment. In 2022, we generated on- and off-site solar energy at 29 locations across our operating companies.  \u00a0 We adopt the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (\u201cLEED\u201d) standard in the U.S. and the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (\u201cBREEAM\u201d) in Europe to guide efficient facility design when appropriate. FedEx Express and FedEx Freight seek LEED certification on all new construction, and in total FedEx has 44 LEED-certified facilities and 13 BREEAM-certified facilities across our operating companies.  \u00a0 To reduce our operational waste footprint, we implement waste and recycling management processes in the U.S. We prioritize reducing our waste generation and recycling the waste we do produce. \u00a0 Sustainable Customer Solutions \u00a0 FedEx works to minimize packaging materials, optimize customer package size and weight, increase shipping efficiency, and maximize recyclability to reduce the environmental impacts of packaging materials and transporting goods. We offer end-to-end sustainability for customers by supplying sustainable packaging solutions and exploring carbon-neutral shipping opportunities. FedEx-branded cardboard packaging is 100% recyclable and contains an average of 36% recycled content. During 2022, 64% of FedEx-branded packaging was third-party certified and all paper purchased by FedEx Office was from vendors with responsible forest-management practices. \u00a0 In 2023, we introduced the FedEx Sustainability Insights tool in the U.S., which built upon our previous Customer Emissions Calculator, to increase accessibility for our customers and suppliers to estimate CO2e shipping emissions at package and account levels. Created by FedEx Dataworks, this cloud-based engine uses near-real time FedEx network data to estimate CO2e emissions for both individual tracking numbers and fedex.com accounts. Users can view historical emissions data by account as well as search by tracking number with their fedex.com login.  \u00a0 For additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment, see fedex.com/en-us/sustainability.html. \u00a0 Governance  \u00a0 The FedEx Board of Directors is comprised of a majority of independent directors and is committed to the highest quality corporate governance and accountability to stockholders. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) and our Code of Conduct, in light of best practices and makes whatever changes it deems appropriate to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code of Conduct, which apply to all of our directors, officers, and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available under the ESG heading under \u201cGovernance\u201d on the Investor Relations page of our website at investors.fedex.com. We will post under the ESG heading on the Investor Relations page of our website information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code of Conduct to the extent such disclosure is required.  \u00a0 Business Segments  \u00a0 The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our principal operating segments:  \u00a0 FedEx Express Segment  \u00a0 FedEx Express  \u00a0 Overview  \u00a0 FedEx Express invented express distribution 50 years ago in 1973 and remains the industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-definite delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through an integrated global network.    - 9 - \u00a0 FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight, connecting markets that generate more than 99% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product through door-to-door, customs-cleared service, historically with a money-back guarantee. As of July 13, 2023, the money-back guarantee remains suspended for certain FedEx Express services in order to balance our focus on service and safety. FedEx Express\u2019s unmatched air route authorities and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge information technologies, make it the world\u2019s largest express transportation company. As of May 31, 2023, FedEx Express employed approximately 245,000 employees and had approximately 70,000 drop-off locations (including FedEx Office stores and FedEx OnSite locations, such as nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores), 700 aircraft, and more than 82,000 vehicles in its global network. \u00a0 FedEx Express also provides time-critical shipment services through FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (\u201cFedEx Custom Critical\u201d) and cross-border enablement and technology solutions and e-commerce transportation solutions. \u00a0 Services  \u00a0 FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. FedEx Express offers three U.S. domestic overnight package delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx SameDay service is available 365 days a year throughout all 50 states for urgent shipments up to 150 pounds. FedEx Express also offers U.S. express overnight and deferred freight services to handle the needs of the time-definite freight market.  \u00a0 International express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five business days. FedEx International First provides time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, with delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from more than 90 countries and Caribbean islands in one or two business days, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada, and by 11:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Mexico. FedEx Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Poland, India, China, and South Africa. In addition, FedEx Express offers comprehensive international express and deferred freight services, real-time tracking, and advanced customs clearance. \u00a0 Our FedEx International Priority service provides end-of-day time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 220 countries and territories, and our FedEx International Priority Express service provides midday time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 25 countries and territories. Additionally, FedEx International Connect Plus, a contractual e-commerce service currently available from nearly 60 origin countries to over 195 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically within two to five business days. \u00a0 For information regarding FedEx Express e-commerce tools and solutions, such as FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see \u201cFedEx Services Segment \u2014 Customer-Driven Technology \u2014 E-Commerce Solutions.\u201d  International Expansion  Over the years, FedEx Express has added capabilities in important international markets that have given us more robust transportation networks. Our 2016 acquisition of TNT Express accelerated our European and global growth; substantially enhanced our global footprint through TNT Express\u2019s lower-cost road networks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; and expanded our capabilities and solutions for our customers. The completion of the physical network integration of TNT Express into FedEx Express in 2022 and consolidation of flights into our Paris hub allow us to significantly improve operational efficiency, and the reopening and completion of central European road hubs in Duiven, The Netherlands and Novara, Italy in 2023 have improved our intra-European service.  \u00a0 We also have expanded our capabilities in the Asia-Pacific markets, including through the establishment of our Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China; our North Pacific regional hub at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, which serves as a consolidation point for shipments from northern Asia to the U.S.; and our International Express and Cargo Hub in Shanghai at Shanghai\u2019s Pudong International Airport. During 2020, we added 14 new Asia-Pacific origin markets for FedEx International First service to the U.S. and Canada. These developments allow us to continue to better serve our global customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets. In 2022, FedEx Express entered into a strategic alliance with Delhivery, a leading logistics and supply chain services company in India.  \u00a0 To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements. \u00a0 - 10 - \u00a0 U.S. Postal Service Agreement  \u00a0 Pursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) that expires on September 29, 2024, FedEx Express provides airport-to-airport transportation of USPS First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail within the U.S. FedEx Express also provides transportation and delivery for the USPS\u2019s international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed under a separate agreement. For more information about our relationship with the USPS, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.  \u00a0 Pricing  \u00a0 FedEx Express periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guides. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 2, 2023, FedEx Express implemented a 6.9% average list price increase for U.S. domestic, U.S. export, and U.S. import services.  \u00a0 In order to manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, between April 2020 and November 2020 FedEx Express implemented temporary surcharges on all international package and airfreight shipments. These surcharges continued as peak surcharges beginning in November 2020 and remain in effect. Additionally, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Express has implemented a series of peak surcharges generally applying to U.S. domestic shipments that are oversized or require additional handling, and to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold. Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges were applied during the 2023 holiday peak season. Effective January 16, 2023, the U.S. domestic holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect for residential shipments, and peak surcharges for shipments that are oversized or require additional handling were adjusted downward.  \u00a0 FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. FedEx Express fuel surcharges are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from ten days prior to the week in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine U.S. domestic fuel surcharges at FedEx Express were updated. Effective January 30, 2023, the tables used to determine certain international fuel surcharges at FedEx Express were updated.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information.  \u00a0 Operations  \u00a0 FedEx Express\u2019s primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company\u2019s multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility is located in Indianapolis. We are making investments over multiple years in our facilities to expand and modernize our Indianapolis hub and modernize our Memphis World Hub. See the \u201cFinancial Condition \u2014 Liquidity Outlook\u201d section of \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Fort Worth, Newark, Oakland, and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Chicago and Los Angeles.  \u00a0 Facilities in Anchorage, Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe, and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. The facilities in Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami \u2014 the Miami Gateway Hub \u2014 serves our South Florida, Latin American, and Caribbean markets. A central air hub near Liege, Belgium connects specific large European markets. In addition to its worldwide air network, FedEx Express operates road networks in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and South America. FedEx Express\u2019s unique European road network connects more than 45 countries and territories through 28 transit hubs and more than 700 stations.  \u00a0 Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers, and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station\u2019s service area. In some international areas, independent agents (\u201cGlobal Service Participants\u201d) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see \u201cItem 2. Properties\u201d of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cFedEx Express Segment.\u201d  \u00a0 In connection with our DRIVE initiatives and through collaborations with FedEx Dataworks, we are transforming and optimizing the FedEx Express network to be more agile and efficient, including through the deployment of digital assets that allow us to more effectively balance the use of FedEx aircraft and Global Service Participants and implementation of a single daily dispatch of couriers within the U.S. domestic network. \u00a0 - 11 - \u00a0 FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its retail locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites, including at nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores. Our unstaffed FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, and corporate or industrial parks. \u00a0 Fuel Supplies and Costs  \u00a0 During 2023, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for estimated amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices. We do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See \u201cPricing\u201d above.  \u00a0 The following table sets forth FedEx Express\u2019s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of FedEx Corporation consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years:  \u00a0 Fiscal Year \u00a0 Total JetFuel Cost(in millions) \u00a0 \u00a0 Percentage of ConsolidatedRevenue \u00a0 2023 \u00a0 $ 4,515 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5.0 % 2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 3,867 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4.1 \u00a0 2021 \u00a0 \u00a0 2,065 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.5 \u00a0 2020 \u00a0 \u00a0 2,265 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3.3 \u00a0 2019 \u00a0 \u00a0 2,847 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4.1 \u00a0 \u00a0 Most of FedEx Express\u2019s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts.  \u00a0 Competition  \u00a0 As described in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report, the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, reliability, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, innovative service offerings, and the fit within the customer\u2019s overall supply chain.  \u00a0 Competitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders, and the USPS. FedEx Express\u2019s principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France\u2019s La Poste\u2019s GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and all-cargo airlines. FedEx Express also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, and may be considered competitors. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. Many of FedEx Express\u2019s international competitors are government-owned, -controlled, or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity, and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express. For more information, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report. \u00a0 Employees  \u00a0 John A. Smith is the President and Chief Executive Officer \u2014 U.S. and Canada Ground Operations of FedEx Express and Richard W. Smith is the President and Chief Executive Officer \u2014 Airline and International of FedEx Express. As of May 31, 2023, FedEx Express employed approximately 188,000 permanent full-time and approximately 56,000 permanent part-time employees.    The pilots of FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by ALPA and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect in November 2015. The collective bargaining agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 the NMB began actively mediating the negotiations. In May 2023, FedEx Express reached a tentative successor agreement with ALPA. The tentative agreement was approved by ALPA\u2019s FedEx Express Master Executive Council in June 2023 and is being presented to FedEx Express\u2019s pilots for ratification during the first quarter of 2024. The ongoing ratification process has no effect on our operations.   - 12 - \u00a0 In addition to our pilots at FedEx Express, certain of FedEx Express\u2019s non-U.S. employees are unionized. In June 2022, the Transport Workers Union filed an application with the NMB requesting an election to represent approximately 130 Global Operations Control (\u201cGOC\u201d) specialists who perform flight dispatching functions in FedEx Express\u2019s GOC center. The NMB dismissed the application in December 2022. FedEx Express believes its employee relations are excellent. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for more information.  \u00a0 FedEx Custom Critical  \u00a0 FedEx Custom Critical provides a range of expedited, time-specific freight-shipping services throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Among its services are Surface Expedite, providing exclusive-use shipping and time-definite services; Air Expedite, offering an array of expedited air solutions to meet customers\u2019 critical delivery times; and White Glove Services, for shipments that require extra care in handling, temperature control, or specialized security. Service from FedEx Custom Critical is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. FedEx Custom Critical continuously monitors shipments through an integrated proprietary shipment-control system, including two-way satellite communications on exclusive-use shipments.  \u00a0 FedEx Ground Segment  \u00a0 Overview \u00a0 By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low-cost structure, and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential ground package delivery services. As of July 13, 2023, the money-back guarantee for all FedEx Ground services remains suspended in order to balance our focus on service and safety. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers. FedEx Ground provides seven-day-per-week residential delivery to more than half of the U.S. population. See \u201cOne FedEx and Network 2.0\u201d above for information regarding the transition of all FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024. \u00a0 The company offers FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment, and signature delivery. Sunday delivery is provided for more than half of the U.S. population. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee. FedEx Ground Economy service is available for the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages to any residential address or PO Box in the U.S.  \u00a0 Pricing \u00a0 FedEx Ground periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 2, 2023, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery implemented a 6.9% average list price increase. FedEx Ground Economy average list prices also increased. \u00a0 To manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Ground implemented a series of surcharges generally applying to shipments that are oversized, unauthorized, or require additional handling; to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold; and to FedEx Ground Economy shipments. Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges were applied during the 2023 holiday peak season. Effective January 16, 2023, the holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect for residential shipments, and peak surcharges for shipments that are oversized or require additional handling were adjusted downward.  \u00a0 FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Ground were updated. See the \u201cResults of Operations and Outlook \u2014 Consolidated Results \u2014 Fuel\u201d section of \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report for more information. \u00a0 - 13 - \u00a0 Operations \u00a0 FedEx Ground operates a highly flexible network of over 700 sortation and distribution facilities, including more than 160 fully automated stations, in the U.S. and Canada as of May 31, 2023. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with more than 100,000 vehicles owned or leased by independent service providers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service and FedEx Ground Economy service, FedEx Ground leverages its pickup operation and hub and linehaul network. \u00a0 Following a network expansion in recent years that substantially increased FedEx Ground\u2019s daily capacity through the addition of new facilities featuring the latest automated sorting technology as well as the expansion or relocation of existing hubs and other facilities, in 2023 the company rationalized its operations in response to lower volumes by consolidating sorts and cancelling several planned network capacity projects, continuing to manage staffing levels effectively, and reducing Sunday delivery operations.  \u00a0 FedEx Ground continues to leverage opportunities to maximize utilization of existing facilities and deploy new technologies to enhance operational efficiency. Advanced automated unloading and sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. FedEx Ground yard management systems, which interact with GPS tags on each trailer and create geofences around FedEx Ground facilities, automatically notify the control center when a trailer arrives and departs. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination stations for local delivery.  \u00a0 Through collaboration with FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Ground is implementing dynamic scheduling tools to match sort staffing headcount with volumes and is introducing capabilities to allow certain packages to bypass station sortation and proceed directly to vehicles, which helps to maximize station capacity. Dock modernization efforts enabled by FedEx Dataworks, including a new network operating plan that uses machine learning and algorithms to develop more detailed and accurate volume forecasts, are enhancing productivity at FedEx Ground in furtherance of our DRIVE initiatives. Additionally, the company is testing autonomous, driverless technologies in the handling of large, non-conveyable packages, as well as artificial intelligence-enabled robotic product sortation systems to sort small packages. \u00a0 Advanced route optimization technology leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks provides service providers near real-time data that can be used to plan efficient delivery routes and make decisions about vehicle mix and workforce. Additionally, software systems and internet-based applications are deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx website, fedex.com. For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-commerce tools and solutions, including FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see \u201cFedEx Services Segment \u2014 Customer-Driven Technology \u2014 E-Commerce Solutions.\u201d  \u00a0 FedEx Ground has introduced new vehicle safety technologies and incentives for adoption by its service providers, as well as new eligibility standards for drivers employed by service providers. Additionally, FedEx Ground has made significant operational enhancements to ensure safe and reliable handling of large and heavy items. These changes include designing new facilities, adding equipment to certain facilities, and making other operational adjustments.  \u00a0 FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its retail locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at all FedEx Authorized ShipCenters and other FedEx OnSite locations, including at nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores.  \u00a0 As of May 31, 2023, FedEx Ground employed approximately 56,000 permanent full-time and approximately 136,000 permanent part-time employees. In addition, FedEx Ground contracts with nearly 7,000 independent small businesses to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of these service providers is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers.  \u00a0 FedEx Ground is defending lawsuits in which it is alleged that FedEx Ground should be treated as an employer or joint employer of drivers employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground. We continue to believe that FedEx Ground is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses. The status of the drivers employed by these service providers could be further challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report. \u00a0 - 14 - \u00a0 Scott L. Ray is the President of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, and its primary competitors are UPS, the USPS, and regional delivery carriers. FedEx Ground also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries.

Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report. \u00a0 FedEx Freight Segment \u00a0 Overview \u00a0 FedEx Freight is a leading North American provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity, and reliability to meet the needs of LTL shippers \u2014 FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer\u2019s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-commerce market for delivery of big and bulky products to or through the door for residences and businesses. Through one comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually every U.S. ZIP Code (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freight Priority has the fastest published transit times of any nationwide LTL service. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers FedEx Freight Priority service, serving most points in Canada, as well as FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service between Canada and the U.S. In addition, FedEx Freight serves Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands via alliances.

With the expansion of FedEx electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx Freight, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. These solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers easy access to their account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice feature available on FedEx Freight Priority shipments uses the company\u2019s innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the internet, e-mail, or fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. Customers can also process cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intra-Canada and -Mexico shipments, through FedEx Ship Manager at fedex.com, FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Ship Manager Server, and FedEx Web Services. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Freight also offers LTL Select, a free cloud-based, multi-carrier transportation management system that provides customers with visibility into all available carriers and their pricing in one location, as well as the ability to book service and make payments. FedEx Freight uses radio frequency identification technology and customized software to improve shipment visibility on its docks and enhance custodial control at the handling unit level. \u00a0 FedEx Freight Direct addresses the growing e-commerce market for big and bulky products. It has four delivery service levels to meet customer needs, with basic and basic by appointment to-the-door services available to nearly 100% of the U.S. population and standard and premium through-the-door services available to 90% of the continental U.S. population, as well as flexible delivery windows, end-to-end visibility, proactive notifications, and returns services with flexible pickup windows and label-less options. \u00a0 As of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Freight segment was operating nearly 30,000 vehicles from a network of approximately 390 service centers and had approximately 43,000 employees. The company plans to close and consolidate approximately 30 locations in the first quarter of 2024, and conducted several rounds of furloughs to match staffing with volume levels in 2023. Lance D. Moll is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight\u2019s primary competitors are YRC Worldwide Inc. (which includes YRC Regional Transportation and YRC Freight), XPO Logistics, Inc., Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., ABF Freight (an ArcBest company), SAIA, Inc., and TFI International Inc. \u00a0 We are currently bargaining with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at one FedEx Freight facility.  \u00a0 Pricing \u00a0 FedEx Freight periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its 100 Rules Tariff. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, class, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 2, 2023, FedEx Freight implemented a 6.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF PZONE and FXF EZONE rates and a 7.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF 1000 and FXF 501. These increases apply for shipments within the U.S. and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada.  \u00a0 - 15 - \u00a0 In order to manage demand and capacity constraints, beginning in July 2021 FedEx Freight implemented a peak surcharge applying to specific delivery points within the U.S. The peak surcharge has been adjusted periodically since implementation. Effective November 15, 2021, FedEx Freight increased applicable length surcharges. Effective January 17, 2022, FedEx Freight added a surcharge that applies when a pickup is performed and no shipment is tendered to the carrier. Effective January 16, 2023, FedEx Freight changed the extreme length surcharge to a tier-based length structure. The company continues to explore ways to modernize freight pricing including through dimension-in-motion technology, which more accurately captures freight profile and improves its ability to cost and price shipments. \u00a0 FedEx Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two days prior to the day in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Freight were updated.

Carere and Robert B. Carter each serve as the Co-President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Services, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Services segment had approximately 15,000 employees.  \u00a0 Customer-Driven Technology  \u00a0 FedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith\u2019s vision that \u201cthe information about a package is as important as the delivery of the package itself\u201d remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy. We strive to build technology solutions that will solve our customers\u2019 business problems with simplicity, convenience, speed, and reliability. Additionally, FedEx stands at the nexus of digital and physical networks, a crucial intersection for the success of e-commerce deliveries. We continue to expand our e-commerce convenience network and explore innovative alternatives to help customers and businesses deliver. During 2023 we continued to advance a major information technology transition from traditional mainframe computing to cloud-based systems, which is delivering significant benefits in terms of flexibility, security, speed to market, and resiliency. See \u201cFedEx Dataworks Operating Segment\u201d below for more information on the solutions we are creating to \u201cInnovate for Tomorrow.\u201d \u00a0 Shipping Management and Precision Tracking \u00a0 The fedex.com website is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use, and customer-focused features. The advanced tracking capability within FedEx Tracking provides customers with a consolidated view of inbound and outbound shipments. Additionally, an advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence model developed by FedEx Dataworks has enhanced tracking capabilities on fedex.com, delivering greater estimated delivery date accuracy, including updates for early or delayed shipments. FedEx Virtual Assistant on fedex.com is an artificial-intelligence-enabled service that provides answers to customer shipping questions, allowing our customer service representatives and sales professionals to focus on higher-value customer interactions.  \u00a0 SenseAware, a FedEx innovation currently available in 135 countries worldwide, allows customers to stay connected to their critical shipments by providing real-time updates regarding current location, precise temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure readings, light exposure, and shock events. Additionally, FedEx SenseAware ID is a lightweight sensor-based logistics device that delivers a new level of precision tracking. The enhanced location visibility provided by FedEx SenseAware ID is creating opportunities for FedEx customers to reimagine their supply chains through real-time updates on a package\u2019s location within the FedEx Express network. FedEx is currently expanding access to FedEx SenseAware ID and plans to eventually make FedEx SenseAware ID available for a broad range of premium FedEx Express services. \u00a0 FedEx Mobile is a suite of solutions including the FedEx mobile application, FedEx mobile website, and SMS text messaging. The FedEx Mobile app provides convenience for recipients to track packages and access FedEx Delivery Manager to customize home deliveries.

It is available on Android\u0099 and Apple devices. The FedEx Mobile app has expanded to more than 220 countries and territories and 40 languages. SMS Notifications allows customers to track or follow a package via text messaging, and it is currently available in five countries.  - 16 - \u00a0 \u00a0 Additionally, our FedEx Ship Manager suite of solutions, which was modernized in 2023, offers a wide range of options to help our customers manage their parcel and LTL shipping and associated processes.  \u00a0 E-Commerce Solutions \u00a0 FedEx Delivery Manager allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range of options to schedule dates, locations, and times of delivery. Additionally, FedEx Returns Technology, a comprehensive solution for returns management, provides high-volume merchants and e-tailers complete visibility into returns and an easy way to track shipments, manage inventory, analyze returns trends, and make more informed decisions based on shoppers\u2019 returns behaviors. In 2023 we launched FedEx Consolidated Returns in the U.S., a low-priced, easy e-commerce solution for low-weight returns facilitated through supply chain services offered by FedEx Logistics and FedEx Office. Through FedEx Consolidated Returns, shoppers who purchased from participating merchants can drop off the items they wish to return with no box or label required at approximately 2,000 FedEx Office locations. The returned items will then be consolidated with other returns and processed through FedEx Logistics and sent back to the merchants via a less-than-truckload option. \u00a0 FedEx OnSite, our retail convenience network, utilizes third-party retailers to receive and hold packages for FedEx customers. The FedEx OnSite network has grown to include nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores in addition to our approximately 2,000 FedEx Office locations. In addition to allowing for an easy returns and drop-off experience for shoppers, the FedEx OnSite network is well positioned to serve as a \u201cbuy online, pickup in store\u201d network for small and medium merchants without brick-and-mortar locations. We have also added FedEx Returns Technology to the Walgreens retail network, which allows for in-store printing of return shipping labels and eliminates the need to include a return label in every package. \u00a0 We have expanded e-commerce delivery options for retailers with FedEx Extra Hours, a service that enables participating retailers to fulfill e-commerce orders into the evening and receive late pickups by FedEx Express, with next-day local delivery and two-day shipping to any address in the continental U.S. FedEx Extra Hours, which is currently available to select customers, allows retailers to extend evening order cutoff times by five to eight hours, with some as late as midnight, depending on their current order fulfillment process. \u00a0 In June 2022, FedEx announced the launch of Picture Proof of Delivery for express and ground residential deliveries in the U.S. and Canada that are released without a signature. The capability has expanded to 90% of global residential deliveries. \u00a0 Through innovative partnerships, FedEx Dataworks seeks to open pathways to e-commerce and empower customers with differentiated insights and tools. In 2021, we announced a multi-year collaboration with Adobe, starting with the integration of ShopRunner with Adobe Commerce\u2019s Magento platform. By integrating their online storefronts with ShopRunner, Adobe merchants are able to offer seamless checkout, two-day shipping, easy returns, and exclusive offers to shippers. The collaboration also gives merchants access to FedEx post-purchase logistics intelligence, allowing for better management of supply chains. In 2022, we announced a multi-year partnership with Salesforce that integrates Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Salesforce Order Management with innovative capabilities from FedEx and ShopRunner. In January 2022, FedEx and Microsoft announced a new cross-platform logistics solution for e-commerce aimed at increasing merchant competitiveness in the e-commerce space by improving customer engagement and providing enhanced shipping options, which was made available to customers in the U.S. in 2023. Additionally, in June 2022 FedEx and FourKites announced a strategic alliance to provide businesses with new, more robust real-time supply chain visibility capabilities. In November 2022, we announced a strategic alliance with Cart.com to create integrated solutions that help address some of the biggest e-commerce challenges. \u00a0 Autonomous Solutions \u00a0 FedEx is exploring the use of autonomous delivery technology within its operations. In 2022, we announced a multi-year, multi-phase agreement to test Nuro\u2019s next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle within FedEx operations. The collaboration with Nuro will explore various use cases for on-road autonomous vehicle logistics such as multi-stop and appointment-based deliveries.  \u00a0 In 2022, we began a pilot program with Aurora Innovation, Inc. (\u201cAurora\u201d) and PACCAR Inc. to test Aurora\u2019s autonomous driving technology in PACCAR autonomous vehicle platform-equipped trucks within FedEx linehaul operations. Additionally, FedEx Express is developing plans to test Elroy Air\u2019s autonomous air cargo system within the company\u2019s middle-mile logistics operations, moving shipments between sortation locations. We are also working with major national retailers, fast food restaurants, and drug stores to help assess different customers\u2019 autonomous delivery needs. In 2023, FedEx ended the research and development program for Roxo, the FedEx SameDay Bot, to prioritize these other nearer-term opportunities. - 17 - \u00a0 Marketing The FedEx brand name symbolizes outstanding service, reliability, and speed. Emphasis is continually placed on promoting and protecting the FedEx brand, one of our most important assets. As a result, FedEx is one of the most widely recognized brands in the world. In addition to television, print, and digital advertising, we promote the FedEx brand through sponsorships and special events. For example, FedEx sponsors: \u00a0 \u0095     The UEFA Champions League, which is broadcast in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. \u00a0 \u0095     The season-long FedExCup competition on the PGA Tour, and the FedEx St. Jude Championship, a PGA Tour event that has raised millions of dollars for St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital and is one of three annual FedExCup playoff events. \u00a0 \u0095     The #11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota Camry driven by Denny Hamlin in the NASCAR Cup Series. \u00a0 Additionally, FedEx is the \u201cOfficial Delivery Service Sponsor\u201d and \u201cOfficial Office Services Provider\u201d of the NFL, through which we conduct events and other activities to promote the FedEx brand, such as the \u201cFedEx Air & Ground\u201d NFL Players of the Week and Players of the Year Awards. Information Security \u00a0 FedEx Services has a team of highly qualified professionals dedicated to securing information about our customers\u2019 shipments and protecting our customers\u2019, vendors\u2019, and employees\u2019 privacy, and we strive to provide a safe, secure online environment for our customers. We are committed to compliance with applicable information security laws, regulations, and industry standards. For a description of risks related to information security, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report. \u00a0 FedEx Dataworks Operating Segment \u00a0 The FedEx Dataworks operating segment is focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and our customers\u2019 supply chains, as well as the end-to-end experience of our customers. The size and scale of our global network gives us a bird\u2019s-eye view of global supply chains and trends and provides an immense amount of data. As the digital twin of our physical network and a key enabler of our DRIVE transformation, FedEx Dataworks leverages this information to allow us to work differently through a more technology-enabled, data-driven approach. See \u201cFedEx Express Segment \u2014 FedEx Express \u2014 Operations\u201d and \u201cFedEx Ground Segment \u2014 Operations\u201d above for information regarding how FedEx Dataworks is enabling the transformation and optimization of our physical network at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. FedEx Dataworks is also helping to build out a dynamic pricing infrastructure, which enabled 2023 holiday peak residential surcharges to adjust dynamically based on an individual customer\u2019s weekly peaking factor, and exploring and implementing ways for predictive anomaly detection to improve revenue quality. \u00a0 FedEx Surround allows business customers to enhance visibility into its supply chain by leveraging data to provide near-real-time analytics into shipment tracking, which will drive more precise logistics and inventory management. FedEx Dataworks is helping to facilitate an open and collaborative e-commerce ecosystem that helps merchants provide seamless end-to-end experiences for their customers. ShopRunner is an e-commerce platform that directly connects brands and merchants with online shoppers. ShopRunner\u2019s data-driven marketing and omnichannel enablement capabilities also help brands and merchants acquire high-value customers and accelerate their digital innovation by using ShopRunner\u2019s e-commerce platform. We believe the complementary nature of ShopRunner\u2019s pre-purchase offerings combined with FedEx\u2019s post-purchase logistics intelligence enables brands and merchants to attract and engage consumers at scale by providing innovative online shopping experiences. In November 2022, ShopRunner announced the launch of its new mobile application.

Print & Go solutions allow customers to access files using popular cloud providers Google Drive\u0099, Box, Microsoft OneDrive\u00ae, and from FedEx Office\u2019s own My Online Documents, making printing easy.  \u00a0 FedEx Office has prioritized e-commerce and digital offerings as a growth opportunity for the enterprise/large, medium, and small business customers we serve. FedEx Office has partnered with a content and creative design platform to form a digital design-to-print marketplace offering millions of images and illustrations, an extensive library of templates, and a simple drag-and-drop interface to create custom business materials from fedex.com on any device, with next-day printing on many requests available at FedEx Office stores.

FedEx Office has also made investments in new machines and technology, enhancing capabilities in narrow format color, grand format, large format, color management, enhanced finishing, and other technologies. \u00a0 FedEx Office provides customers convenient access to the full range of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping services. Customers may have their FedEx Express and FedEx Ground packages delivered to any FedEx Office customer-facing location nationwide through the Hold at FedEx Location service, free of charge, and may redirect packages to these locations through Redirect to Hold or AutoRedirect to Hold services. FedEx Office facilitates e-commerce and returns through FedEx Returns Technology, which allows for in-store printing of return shipping labels. Through FedEx Consolidated Returns, which we launched in 2023, shoppers who purchased from participating merchants can drop off the items they wish to return with no box or label required at a FedEx Office location. For information regarding FedEx Consolidated Returns, see \u201cFedEx Services Segment \u2014 Customer-Driven Technology \u2014 E-Commerce Solutions.\u201d We discontinued FedEx SameDay City operations during 2023. \u00a0 FedEx Office also offers packing services, and packing supplies and boxes are included in its retail offerings.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d of this Annual Report. Trademarks \u00a0 The \u201cFedEx\u201d trademark, service mark, and trade name are essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Services, FedEx Office, FedEx Logistics, FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage, FedEx Supply Chain, FedEx Custom Critical, and ShopRunner, among others, are trademarks, service marks, and trade names of Federal Express Corporation or the respective companies for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file, as applicable. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks, and trade names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks, and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.  Regulation  \u00a0 Air. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the \u201cFederal Aviation Act\u201d), both the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) and the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express.  \u00a0 - 20 - \u00a0 The FAA\u2019s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations.  \u00a0 The DOT\u2019s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT\u2019s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis. These certificates will remain in effect as we maintain our economic fitness to perform all-cargo services in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. \u00a0 Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (\u201cTSA\u201d), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.  \u00a0 FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (\u201cCRAF\u201d) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Express\u2019s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights.  \u00a0 See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for discussion of regulations related to pilots, including the proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations, that could affect our business. \u00a0 Ground. The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes, or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.  \u00a0 The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates, routes, and services in interstate freight transportation.  \u00a0 Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those at FedEx Express, are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations. \u00a0 International. FedEx Express\u2019s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOT\u2019s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner, and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by U.S. and foreign governments.  \u00a0 Our operations outside of the U.S., such as FedEx Express\u2019s international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market.  \u00a0 - 21 - \u00a0 Communication. Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) regulates and licenses FedEx Express\u2019s activities pertaining to satellite communications, and also manages the spectrum allocation and licensing process. The FCC recently expanded the use of the 3.7 to 4.2 gigahertz (\u201cGHz\u201d) spectrum band, which has historically been reserved for aviation, to support the implementation of \u201c5G\u201d cellular networks across the U.S. In December 2021, following concerns of potential interference with aircraft radio altimeters by the expanded use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz spectrum band, the FAA issued airworthiness directives prohibiting U.S. aircraft operators from operating at U.S. airports affected by 5G cellular networks without radio altimeter retrofits or other enhancements unless authorized via an alternative means of compliance. FedEx Express\u2019s U.S. air operations continued to operate with minimal interruption due to the FAA\u2019s issuance of alternative means of compliance while the company modified its fleet to comply with the directives. In June 2022, the FAA announced its expectation that U.S. aircraft operators have radio altimeter retrofits or other enhancements in place by July 2023. As of July 1, 2023, FedEx Express\u2019s U.S. air operations are in compliance with the airworthiness directives, and we do not expect any subsequent operational disruptions from \u201c5G\u201d cellular network implementation. \u00a0 Environmental.  \u00a0 Noise: Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Express\u2019s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Express\u2019s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect in any of FedEx Express\u2019s significant markets. Congress\u2019s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express\u2019s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.  \u00a0 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Concern over climate change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (\u201cICAO\u201d) formally adopted a global, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\u201cCORSIA\u201d). This program established a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon neutral growth in international aviation beginning in calendar 2021. Any growth above a global industry emissions baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible carbon offset credits or qualifying sustainable aviation fuel purchases. The baseline was originally set as an average of calendar 2019 and calendar 2020 emissions. In 2023, due to the effects of COVID-19 on the airline industry, the ICAO adopted a new baseline of 85% of calendar 2019 emissions. To date, however, while the U.S. Congress is considering proposals to afford the DOT and FAA full authority to implement the market-based measures of CORSIA, the U.S. has not fully implemented CORSIA. In the interim, we continue to voluntarily report our emissions data to the FAA. \u00a0 Other ICAO member states are moving forward with implementing CORSIA, and have taken additional action to reduce aircraft GHG emissions. For example, both the EU and the United Kingdom have implemented regulations to include aviation in the Emissions Trading Scheme (\u201cETS\u201d). For the EU, under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) is subject to the ETS. Beginning in calendar 2012, airlines including FedEx were required to purchase emissions allowances or, alternatively, purchase qualifying sustainable aviation fuel if they exceeded the number of free allowances allocated under the ETS. While the current scope of ETS has been limited to apply only to flights within the EEA through calendar 2026, the EU adopted legislation in 2023 requiring that a study be conducted in July 2026 reassessing whether the European Commission should propose to expand the scope of ETS to include international flights from the EEA based on CORSIA implementation and performance. \u00a0 We expect compliance with CORSIA and the ETS to increase FedEx operating expenses. The amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including the number of our flights subject to CORSIA and the ETS, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, the average growth of the aviation sector, our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of such fuels, and the price of eligible emission units, offsets, or allowances required to be purchased by FedEx.  \u00a0 - 22 - \u00a0 Additionally, in 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020, but also to new deliveries of currently in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. ICAO established a production cutoff date of January 1, 2028 for aircraft that do not comply with these standards. The standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In 2021, the EPA adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards, and the FAA is advancing its own conforming rulemaking to implement the standards through its aircraft certification process. In the past, the U.S. Congress has also considered bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. In 2021 the U.S. reentered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 197 countries to reduce GHG emissions. The effect of the reentry on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG regulation is uncertain. Additionally, the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business. \u00a0 Hazardous Substances: In calendar 2022, the EPA proposed regulations to categorize certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\u201cPFAS\u201d) as \u201chazardous substances\u201d under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d). Numerous U.S. states, including California, have adopted additional regulations governing these substances. PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, including the firefighting foams approved for use by the FAA to extinguish fuel-based fires at airports and refineries. The EPA\u2019s proposed rule, once finalized, could subject airports, airlines, and refineries to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination. We could incur remediation costs for currently and formerly operated facilities. While the impact of this rulemaking on our business and results of operations cannot currently be predicted, we remain committed to transitioning to PFAS-free materials for fire suppression in accordance with the framework outlined by the FAA in May 2023. \u00a0 We are also subject to international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise, and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. FedEx Express has an environmental management system based on International Standardization 14001 designed to maintain compliance with these regulations and minimize our operational environmental footprint, and certified all U.S. airport locations in 2022.  \u00a0 Export Controls. In recent years, the U.S. government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to U.S. export control regulations. Such regulations can restrict the types of items that FedEx customers are permitted to ship to certain entities, and in some instances may prohibit FedEx from serving certain entities altogether. Violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (the \u201cECRA\u201d) and its implementing regulations, the Export Administration Regulations (the \u201cEARs\u201d), hold carriers such as FedEx strictly liable for shipments that may violate the EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. Violations of the ECRA can result in criminal penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties of $305,000 (or twice the value of the transaction) per individual violation. FedEx is investing in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs. However, the heightened focus on export controls by the U.S. government increases FedEx\u2019s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs.  \u00a0 Customs. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding), and the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.  \u00a0 Labor. All U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the \u201cRLA\u201d), while labor relations within the U.S. at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the \u201cNLRA\u201d). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the NMB before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process.  \u00a0 The RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are now the dominant national transportation systems. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network.  \u00a0 - 23 - \u00a0 The U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. This jurisdiction could be challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the NMB and the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d), have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, and employees of service providers contracting with FedEx Ground, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these and other potential labor law changes, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report. \u00a0 Data Protection. There has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally. For more information regarding data protection regulation, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.  - 24 - \u00a0", "time": "00:00:07"}
