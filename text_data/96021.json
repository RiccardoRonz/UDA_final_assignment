Overview  Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions, is the largest global distributor of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry.\u00a0Our purpose is \u201cConnecting the World to Share Food and Care for One Another.\u201d We provided products and related services to approximately 725,000 customer locations, including restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers during fiscal 2023.   Founded in 1969, Sysco commenced operations as a public company in March 1970 when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged their stock for Sysco common stock.\u00a0Since our formation, we have grown from $115 million to our all-time high of $76.3 billion in annual sales in fiscal 2023, both through internal expansion of existing operations and acquisitions.   Sysco\u2019s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th.\u00a0This resulted in a 52-week year ended July 1, 2023 for fiscal 2023, a 52-week year ended July 2, 2022 for fiscal 2022 and a 53-week year ended July 3, 2021 for fiscal 2021. We will have a 52-week year ending June\u00a029, 2024 for fiscal 2024.   Sysco Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware.\u00a0The address and telephone number of our executive offices are 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077-2099, (281) 584-1390. This annual report on Form 10-K, as well as all other reports filed or furnished by Sysco pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), are available free of charge on Sysco\u2019s website at www.sysco.com as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Reporting Segments  Sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers.\u00a0Our primary operations are in North America and Europe.\u00a0Under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, we have combined certain operations into three reportable segments. \u201cOther\u201d financial information is attributable to our other operations that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.  \u2022U.S. Foodservice Operations \u2013 primarily includes (a) our U.S. Broadline operations, which distribute a full line of food products, including custom-cut meat, seafood, produce, specialty Italian, specialty imports and a wide variety of non-food products and (b) our U.S. Specialty operations, which include our FreshPoint fresh produce distribution business, our Specialty Meats and Seafood Group specialty protein operations, our growing Italian Specialty platform anchored by Greco & Sons, our Asian specialty distribution company and a number of other small specialty businesses that are not material to the operations of Sysco;  \u2022International Foodservice Operations \u2013 includes operations outside of the United States (U.S.), which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products. The Americas primarily consists of operations in Canada, Bahamas, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as our export operations that distribute to international customers. Our European operations primarily consist of operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Ireland and Sweden; \u2022SYGMA \u2013 our U.S. customized distribution operations serving quick-service chain restaurant customer locations; and \u2022Other \u2013 primarily our hotel supply operations, Guest Worldwide.  Foodservice operating sites distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both independent and chain restaurant customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served.\u00a0SYGMA operating sites distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations. Selected financial data for each of our reportable segments, as well as financial information concerning geographic areas, can be found in Note 21, \u201cBusiness Segment Information,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 1 1 1      Customers and Products  Sysco\u2019s customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants, hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, schools and colleges, hotels and motels, industrial caterers and other similar venues where foodservice products are served.  The products we distribute include: \u2022frozen foods, such as meats, seafood, fully prepared entr\u00e9es, fruits, vegetables and desserts; \u2022canned and dry foods; \u2022fresh meats and seafood; \u2022dairy products; \u2022beverage products; \u2022imported specialties; and \u2022fresh produce.

(1)  Our distribution centers, which we refer to as operating sites, distribute branded merchandise, as well as products packaged under our private brands. Products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for Sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team. In addition, our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged, enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements.  We believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders, competitive pricing, customer service and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers. Our operating sites offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice. Through the sales and marketing representatives and support staff, we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services. We also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution, such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data, menu-planning advice, food safety training and assistance in inventory control. Additionally, we provide access to various third-party services designed to add value to our customers\u2019 businesses.  No single customer accounted for 10% or more of Sysco\u2019s total sales for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2023. 2 2 2      We estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows: Type of Customer202320222021Restaurants (1)62\u00a0%63\u00a0%66\u00a0%Education, government8\u00a08\u00a06\u00a0Travel and leisure8\u00a07\u00a05\u00a0Healthcare7\u00a08\u00a09\u00a0Other (2)15\u00a014\u00a014\u00a0Totals100\u00a0%100\u00a0%100\u00a0% Restaurants (1) Other (2) (1)Restaurants returned to a pre-pandemic percentage of total sales in fiscal year 2023.

(2)Other includes cafeterias that are not stand-alone restaurants, bakeries, caterers, churches, civic and fraternal organizations, vending distributors, other distributors and international exports, as well as retail food sales and logistics services. None of these types of customers, as a group, exceeded 5% of total sales in any of the years for which information is presented. (1) Restaurants returned to a pre-pandemic percentage of total sales in fiscal year 2023. For comparability purposes, in both fiscal years 2020 and 2019, restaurants constituted 62% of total sales.  (2) Other includes cafeterias that are not stand-alone restaurants, bakeries, caterers, churches, civic and fraternal organizations, vending distributors, other distributors and international exports, as well as retail food sales and logistics services. None of these types of customers, as a group, exceeded 5% of total sales in any of the years for which information is presented.  We estimate that sales to our customers in the food service management (FSM) sector, which include large customers that service cafeterias in institutions such as universities, hospitals, and sporting venues, accounted for 7% of sales in fiscal 2023, as compared to 6% of sales in fiscal 2022. These sales are reflected within the respective customer types listed in the table above, depending on the type of customer the FSM operator serves.  Sources of Supply  We purchase from thousands of suppliers, both domestic and international, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of our purchases for fiscal 2023.\u00a0These suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise, as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers.\u00a0We also provide specialty and seasonal products from small to mid-sized producers to meet a growing demand for locally sourced products. Our locally sourced products, including produce, meats, cheese and other products, help differentiate our customers\u2019 offerings, satisfy demands for new products, and support local communities. Merchandise is generally purchased through both centrally developed programs, domestically and internationally, and direct programs established by our various operating sites.  We administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop, obtain and ensure consistent quality food and non-food products. The program covers the purchasing and marketing of branded merchandise, as well as products from several national brand suppliers, encompassing substantially all product lines. Some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers to build strategic relationships with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network. We also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and aggregate inventory levels. This reduces future facility expansion needs at our operating sites, while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers.  Working Capital Practices  Our growth is funded through a combination of cash on hand, cash flow from operations, commercial paper issuances and long-term borrowings. See the discussion in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d regarding our liquidity, financial position and sources and uses of funds.   We extend credit terms to some of our customers based on our assessment of each customer\u2019s creditworthiness. We monitor each customer\u2019s account and will suspend shipments if necessary.  A majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of customer order placement. We generally maintain inventory on hand to meet customer demand. The level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelf-life, supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand. We also purchase additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities. We take advantage of suppliers\u2019 cash discounts where appropriate. Otherwise, we pay our suppliers according to our payment terms.  Global Support Center  Our Global Support Center (GSC) provides numerous centralized services to our operating sites and performs support activities for employees, suppliers and customers. GSC team members possess experience and expertise in, among other areas,  3 3 3     customer and vendor contract administration, accounting and finance, treasury, legal, information technology, payroll and employee benefits, risk management and insurance, sales and marketing, merchandising, inbound logistics, human resources, strategy and tax compliance services. The GSC also makes available supply chain expertise in warehousing, distribution, and omni-channel strategic services, which provide assistance in operational best practices, including space utilization, energy conservation, fleet management and workflow.  Capital Improvements  During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, $793.3 million, $632.8 million and $470.7 million, respectively, were invested in facilities, technology, equipment, delivery fleet and other capital asset enhancements. From time to time, we dispose of assets in the normal course of business and we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, were $751.2 million, $608.7 million and $411.5 million, respectively. Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were 1.0%, 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. During the three years ended July 1, 2023, capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds along with bank and other borrowings. We expect our capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, to continue to approximate 1% of sales in fiscal 2024, and we expect to finance these capital expenditures from cash flows from operations and bank and other borrowings.  Human Capital Resources  We believe engaged and empowered colleagues are key to business success. Attracting, developing and retaining the best talent globally drives the company\u2019s long-term value. Our diverse colleagues and inclusive culture create an environment where colleagues can develop their skills and contribute to our success. As of July 1, 2023, we employed approximately 72,000 employees, including 50,000 U.S. employees and 22,000 employees outside the U.S., as compared to approximately 71,000 employees as of July 2, 2022. Also, approximately 99% of our U.S.-based colleagues are classified as full-time, defined as employees who work 30 or more hours per week. Approximately 15% of our employees were represented by unions, primarily the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and unions in France and Sweden. Approximately 8% of our union U.S. employees and 20% of our union international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to renegotiation in fiscal 2024.  Talent Acquisition and Talent Management \u2014 Maintaining a pipeline of talent is critical to our ongoing success and is essential to our succession planning efforts and to growing leaders throughout the organization. Our leadership is responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. Specifically, we promote employee development by cultivating a high-impact learning culture for our colleagues through a variety of enterprise development programs and learning resources, including goal-setting and career development processes. We commit to investing in our employees through on the job training and coaching.  Additionally, through our Sysco Speaks program, we conduct annual, confidential engagement surveys of our global workforce that are administered and analyzed by an independent third party.  Total Rewards \u2014 We are committed to equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider various factors, such as an employee\u2019s role and experience, job location and individual performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay. In fiscal 2023, our hourly colleagues received an average hourly wage of $24.15, and 100% of colleagues in our U.S. distribution facilities received pay above state minimum wage thresholds. Also, some of our full-time colleagues receive paid vacation and sick time benefits, short-term and long-term incentives, retirement plans, training and development, access to career opportunities, paid pregnancy and adoption leave benefits, short-term and long-term disability benefits, health and welfare benefits, and recognition, as well as other programs like employee discounts.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \u2014 Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) team develops global strategic initiatives that are implemented to ensure that the needs specific to each region are addressed. Our vision is to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment that reflects the customers and communities we serve. We use our Global DEI Advisory Council to monitor and enhance our three-year DEI Roadmap and Real Talk Dialogues which provide leaders and colleagues safe forums to have open, honest, two-way and completely voluntary conversations. Our Colleague Resource Groups (CRGs) are voluntary, colleague-led groups organized to foster a diverse, inclusive workplace at Sysco. They are a critical element of our engagement and DEI efforts at both our headquarters and at operating sites.   4 4 4     As of July 1, 2023, our U.S. employee population possessed the gender, ethnic and racial attributes identified below: United States Employee Population (1)MaleFemaleWhiteHispanic or LatinoBlack or African AmericanAsianAmerican Indian or Alaskan NativeNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific IslanderTwo or more racesNot AvailableIndividual Contributors81\u00a0%19\u00a0%42\u00a0%26\u00a0%23\u00a0%4\u00a0%1\u00a0%1\u00a0%2\u00a0%1\u00a0%Management74\u00a026\u00a063\u00a016\u00a012\u00a05\u00a01\u00a01\u00a02\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Senior Management74\u00a026\u00a079\u00a06\u00a06\u00a06\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a02\u00a01\u00a0Officers72\u00a028\u00a066\u00a05\u00a014\u00a05\u00a01\u00a0\u2014\u00a03\u00a06\u00a0Total Sysco80\u00a020\u00a045\u00a025\u00a021\u00a04\u00a01\u00a01\u00a02\u00a01\u00a0 United States Employee Population (1) (1)Information is based on self-reported identification.

Our customers may choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets, including club, cash and carry and grocery stores, online retailers, or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers. We compete with local and regional distributors and some organizations that operate on a multi-region basis. In addition, these local, regional and multi-regional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix, improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities. Our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently. Customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors; specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce, meat or seafood; other wholesale channels; club stores; cash and carry stores; grocery stores; and numerous online retailers. Since switching costs are very low, customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts, the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis, and competitive prices. There are few barriers to market entry.   We estimate we serve more than 17% of the approximately $350 billion annual foodservice market in the U.S., as estimated by Technomic, Inc., for calendar year 2022. Technomic projects the market size to increase to approximately $370\u00a0billion by the end of calendar 2023. We also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share. We believe, based upon industry trade data, our sales to the U.S. and Canada food-away-from-home industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2023. While comprehensive industry statistics are not available, we believe that, in most instances, our operations in the U.S. and Canada are among the leading distributors of food and related non-food products to foodservice customers in those trade areas.\u00a0We believe our competitive advantages include our sales consultants; our diversified product base, which includes quality-assured Sysco brand products; our service reliability; the ancillary services we provide to our customers, such as business reviews and menu analysis; and our multi-regional presence in North America and Europe. These advantages combined with a large geographical footprint of multi-temperature warehouses, mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time.  Government Regulation  Our company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business.  In the U.S., as a marketer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates, including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods; prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels; regulates food contact packaging and materials; and maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry  5 5 5     inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of these products and establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal consumption.  The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) has significantly expanded our food safety requirements. The FDA has finalized regulations implementing the FSMA, recognizing that ensuring the safety of the food supply is a shared responsibility among many different points in the global supply chain. The FSMA rules are designed to identify specific actions that must be taken at each of these points to prevent contamination. We have established and continue to maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated, as required by FDA regulations implementing FSMA. The FSMA further imposes requirements for food products imported into the U.S. and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority.   We and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute. We are also subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which governs the process for collective bargaining between employers and employees and protects the rights of both employers and employees in the workplace.  Our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by the FDA and USDA. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. We also must comply with Federal Trade Commission standards with respect to any claims made about our food products in advertising and marketing materials.  Our customers include several departments of the federal government, including the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, as well as certain state and local entities. These customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors.  We are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers. We are also subject to regulations by the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which collectively regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of service. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations. We are subject to regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration covering items transported by air. In addition, we are subject to the federal False Claims Act, and similar state statutes, which prohibit knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government and the knowing and improper retention of overpayments.   The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized and recorded. We have implemented and continue to develop an anti-corruption compliance program applicable to our global operations intended to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anti-corruption laws in countries where we operate.  Our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the U.S. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. In many jurisdictions, compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us. Our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.  Outside the U.S., our business is subject to numerous similar statutes, regulations, and other regulatory requirements. For example, we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the European Union (EU), as well as those of EU countries, where we conduct business (including Ireland, France and Sweden). Those requirements relate to, among other things,  6 6 6     competition, product composition, packaging, labeling, advertisement (including nutrition and health claims) and the safety of food products, as well as the health, safety and working conditions of employees. We are subject to privacy laws in the EU, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data. In addition, our business is subject to the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015, which requires certain companies that operate in the U.K. to prepare a report describing steps that they have taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in their supply chain or business. Our business is also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, an anti-corruption law that criminalizes the failure by a company to prevent persons associated with that company from offering or paying bribes to government officials or non-government persons in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company, as well as restricting the offer, payment or receipt of bribes to or from governmental officials and non-governmental persons.  All of our company\u2019s facilities and other operations in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU, relating to: (1) the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater; (2) the discharge of pollutants into the air, including vehicle emissions; (3) proper handling, treatment and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes; and (4) protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases. Further, most of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks (including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks). See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operational Risks - We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and we may be subject to substantial fines, penalties, or third-party claims for non-compliance.\u201d  General  We have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance, including the SYSCO\u00ae and Brakes\u00ae trademarks, in addition to our privately branded product trademarks that include these trademarks. These trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry. Both our U.S. and European trademarks are effective for a ten-year period, and we generally renew our trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use. We believe the loss of the SYSCO\u00ae trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We do not have any material patents or licenses.  We are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products.  Our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis; therefore, our business is not deemed to be seasonal.  As of July 1, 2023, we operated 334 distribution facilities throughout North America and Europe.  ", "time": "00:00:04"}
