Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited in September 1997.  Business Segments The Company\u2019s business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters and TA. The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instrument systems, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company\u2019s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes.  Information concerning revenues and long-lived assets attributable to each of the Company\u2019s products, services and geographic areas is set forth in Note\u00a018 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.  \u00a0 1    \nWaters Products and Markets High-Performance and Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes that HPLC\u2019s performance capabilities enable it to separate, identify and quantify a high proportion of all known chemicals. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes, quality control and process engineering applications.  The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these markets, HPLC is used extensively to understand diseases, identify new drugs, develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations and the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as chemical and consumer products. Waters also has in vitro diagnostic labelled products that are used as general-purpose instruments for clinical diagnostic applications, such as newborn screening and therapeutic drug management, in countries where these products are registered. HPLC is also used by universities, research institutions and governmental agencies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and their foreign counterparts that mandate safety and efficacy testing.  In 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company describes as ultra-performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY UPLCTM, to accommodate the increased pressure and narrower chromatographic bands that are generated by these small and tightly packed particles. By using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses previously performed by HPLC. In addition, in using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information. While offering significant performance advantages, the ACQUITY UPLC is also compatible with the Company\u2019s software products and the general operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the Company\u2019s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this innovative technology and instrument. In 2018, the Company introduced the ACQUITY ARCTM\u00a0Bio System, a versatile, iron-free,\u00a0bio-inert,\u00a0quaternary liquid chromatograph specifically engineered to improve bioseparation analytical methods.

MaxPeakTM HPS technology, which was first introduced with  \u00a0 2    \n\nthe Company\u2019s introduction of ACQUITYTM PREMIER Columns in 2020, is a surface technology that forms a barrier between the sample and the metal surfaces of both the system and column, eliminating the need for system passivation, mitigating the loss of metal-sensitive analytes and yielding higher quality data in less time and effort. The primary consumable products for LC instruments are chromatography columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in the LC testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals. The chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from silica or polymeric resins. As a pressurized sample is introduced to the column inlet and permeates through the packed column, it is separated into its constituent components.  Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and competitors\u2019 LC systems. The Company believes that it is one of a few suppliers in the world that manufactures silica and polymeric resins, packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and can react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company believes that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used primarily on its ACQUITY UPLC instrument systems and, furthermore, that its ACQUITY UPLC instruments primarily use ACQUITY UPLC columns. In 2019, the Company introduced the\u00a0BioResolv SCX mAb Columns and VanGuardTM FIT Cartridge technologies. These new cation exchange column lines with specialized consumables are designed to simplify and improve the characterization and monitoring of monoclonal antibody (\u201cmAb\u201d) therapeutics, as well as enable mAb charge-variant analyses as required by the World Health Organization, the FDA and the International Conference on Harmonization for confirming the efficacy and safety of biologics and biosimilars with discovery, development and manufacturing applications. In 2020, Waters introduced ACQUITYTM PREMIER Columns, a new family of premium sub-2-micron columns featuring MaxPeakTM HPS technology. The columns are for use with any brand of UPLC system and can measurably improve data quality by mitigating the loss of sample analytes due to analyte-to-surface interactions.  The Company\u2019s precision chemistry consumable products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products, including Certified Reference Materials and Proficiency Testing products. Laboratories around the world and across multiple industries use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis.  In 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Andrew Alliance, S.A. and its two operating subsidiaries, Andrew Alliance USA, Inc. and Andrew Alliance France, SASU (collectively, \u201cAndrew Alliance\u201d), for $80\u00a0million, net of cash acquired. Andrew Alliance offers lab workflow automation solutions with the combination of its software platform and smart, connected laboratory equipment and accessories. The Company anticipates that full integration of Andrew Alliance will allow us to positively impact our customers\u2019 workflows by improving the repeatability, performance and speed of laboratory operations and chemistry workflows.   Mass Spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry MS is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of molecules that have been converted into ions.  The Company is a technology and market leader in the development, manufacture, sale and service of MS instruments and components. These instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems, such as LC, chemical electrophoresis and gas chromatography.

These instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development, as well as for environmental, clinical and nutritional safety testing. The overwhelming majority of mass spectrometers sold by the Company are designed to utilize an LC system and a liquid compatible interface (such as an electrospray ionization source) as the sample introduction device. These products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the pharmaceutical, biomedical, clinical, food and beverage and environmental market segments worldwide.  MS is an increasingly important detection technology for LC. The Company\u2019s smaller-sized mass spectrometers, such as the single quadrupole detector and the tandem quadrupole detector (\u201cTQD\u201d), are often referred to as LC \u201cdetectors\u201d and are typically sold as part of an LC system or as an LC system upgrade. Larger quadrupole systems, such as the XevoTM TQ and Xevo TQ-S instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for late-stage drug development, including clinical trial testing. Quadrupole time-of-flight (\u201cQ-Tof\u201d) instruments, such as the Company\u2019s SYNAPTTM G2-S, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes, an application sometimes referred to as \u201cproteomics\u201d.  LC and MS are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general-purpose analytical device. An increasing percentage of the Company\u2019s customers are purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it has become common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user. The descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly in today\u2019s instrument market, this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS technologies as part of a single device. In response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters operating segment to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated LC-MS systems.  In 2019, the Company introduced the BioAccordTM system, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry solution that expands access to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry capabilities. The system provides new levels of user experience with automated setup and self-diagnosis delivered through an intuitive user interface. Also in 2019, the Company introduced the Cyclic IMS system, which seamlessly integrates cyclic ion mobility technology into a high-performance research-grade time-of-flight mass spectrometer. In addition, the Company introduced the SYNAPT XS, a new highly flexible, high-resolution mass spectrometer for research and development labs focused on discovery applications. The Company also reinforced its tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry portfolio during the current year with upgrades to the\u00a0Xevo TQ-S micro\u00a0and the introduction of the new\u00a0Xevo TQ-S cronos.

Quadrupole time-of-flight (\u201cQ-Tof\u201d) instruments, such as the Company\u2019s SYNAPTTM G2-S, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes, an application sometimes referred to as \u201cproteomics\u201d.  LC and MS are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general-purpose analytical device. An increasing percentage of the Company\u2019s customers are purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it has become common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user. The descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly in today\u2019s instrument market, this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS technologies as part of a single device. In response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters operating segment to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated LC-MS systems.  In 2019, the Company introduced the BioAccordTM system, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry solution that expands access to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry capabilities. The system provides new levels of user experience with automated setup and self-diagnosis delivered through an intuitive user interface. Also in 2019, the Company introduced the Cyclic IMS system, which seamlessly integrates cyclic ion mobility technology into a high-performance research-grade time-of-flight mass spectrometer.

During 2022, 59% of the Company\u2019s net sales were to pharmaceutical accounts, 31% to other industrial accounts and 10% to academic institutions and governmental agencies. Although the Company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.  The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of many customers who tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year-end. The Company does not rely on any single customer for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of the Company\u2019s net sales.  Sales and Service The Company has one of the largest direct sales and service organizations focused exclusively on the analytical workflows offered by the Company. Across these product technologies, using respective specialized sales and service workforces, the Company serves its customer base with 83 sales offices throughout the world as of December\u00a031, 2022 and approximately 4,500, 4,300 and 4,000 field representatives in 2022, 2021 and 2020, \n\u00a0 7 \n \nIn 2021, TA introduced the TRIOS AutoPilot software for its thermal analyzer product line. This software helps laboratory staff using TA\u2019s thermal analyzers create routine and streamlined standard operating procedures improving the speed and productivity of thermal analysis measurements.  In 2022, TA introduced the Powder Rheology Accessory, which enables our Discovery Hybrid Rheometers to characterize the behavior of powders during storage, dispensing, processing and end-use. The Powder Rheology Accessory provides relevant property and processing measurements for battery electrode coatings to prevent defects that cause cell failure and pharmaceutical tablets to prevent instabilities of API blends.  In 2022, TA introduced Polymer Workflow Guided Methods, which provides walk up and use functionality by codifying polymer workflows. Guided Methods leverages the power of AutoPilot and enables novice users to quickly learn and use the instrument to set up test methods, run tests, and execute analyses across our Thermal Analysis and Rheology product lines.  TA Service Similar to Waters, the servicing and support of TA\u2019s instruments is an important source of revenue and represented more than 25% of sales for TA in 2022. TA operates independently from the Waters operating segment, though many of its overseas offices are jointly occupied with Waters to achieve operational efficiencies. TA has dedicated field sales and service operations. Service sales are primarily derived from the sale of support plans, replacement parts and billed labor fees associated with the repair, maintenance and upgrade of installed systems.  Global Customers The Company typically has a broad and diversified customer base that includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts, universities and governmental agencies. Purchase of the Company\u2019s instrument systems is often dependent on its customers\u2019 capital spending, or funding as in the cases of academic, governmental and research institutions, which often fluctuate from year to year. The pharmaceutical segment represents the Company\u2019s largest sector and includes multinational pharmaceutical companies, generic drug manufacturers, contract research organizations (\u201cCRO\u201ds) and biotechnology companies. The Company\u2019s other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers, polymer manufacturers, food and beverage companies and environmental testing laboratories. The Company also sells to universities and governmental agencies worldwide. The Company\u2019s technical sales and support staff members work closely with its customers in developing and implementing applications that meet their full range of analytical requirements.

In 2021, the Company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products. However, the Company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The Company is in the process of evaluating its 2022 supply chain, and the Company plans to file its 2022 Form SD with the SEC in May\u00a02023. The results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the Company\u2019s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products.  In addition, the Company continues to monitor environmental, health and safety regulations in countries in which it operates throughout the world, in particular, European Union and China Restrictions on the use of certain Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment and European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. Further information regarding these regulations is available on the Company\u2019s website, www.waters.com, under the caption \u201cAbout Waters / Corporate Governance\u201d.  Research and Development The Company maintains an active research and development program focused on the development and commercialization of products that extend, complement and update its existing product offering. The Company\u2019s research and development expenditures for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $176\u00a0million, $168\u00a0million and $141\u00a0million, respectively.  Nearly all of the Company\u2019s LC products have been developed at the Company\u2019s main research and development center located in Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the Company\u2019s extensive field organizations and customers. The majority of the Company\u2019s MS\u00a0products are developed at facilities in England and most of the Company\u2019s current materials characterization products are developed at the Company\u2019s research and development center in New Castle, Delaware. At December\u00a031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were approximately 1,233, 1,150 and 1,112 employees, respectively, involved in the Company\u2019s research and development efforts. The Company has increased research and development expenses from its continued commitment to invest significantly in new product development and existing product enhancements, and as a result of acquisitions. Despite the Company\u2019s active research and development programs, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s product development and commercialization efforts will be successful or that the products developed by the Company will be accepted by the marketplace.  \u00a0 9    \nIn 2020, the Company opened a new research laboratory in Cambridge, MA, which serves as a strategic, collaborative space in the community, where Waters can partner with academia, research and industry to accelerate the next generation of scientific advancements.  Human Capital We believe that our people differentiate our business and are vital to our continued success. As a result, we have made important investments in our workforce through initiatives and programs that support talent development and inclusion and enhance our Total Rewards programs.  Employees The Company employed approximately 8,200, 7,800 and 7,400 employees at December\u00a031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with approximately 39% of the Company\u2019s employees located in the United States. The Company believes its employee relations are generally good. The Company\u2019s employees are not unionized or affiliated with any internal or external labor organizations.  Talent Development We believe that our future success depends in a significant part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees and then contribute to the growth and development of these employees.  We further the growth and development of our employees by investing in various programs, digital platforms and workshops that build professional and technical skills. In addition, management periodically assesses succession planning for certain key positions and reviews our workforce to identify high potential employees for future growth and development.  Inclusion\u00a0& Diversity We believe inclusion is a core tenet of organizational success and that fostering a sense of inclusivity allows our employees to maximize their performance contribution to our business. In 2021, we hired our first Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to help strategize and focus Waters\u2019 inclusivity efforts. We celebrate difference and diversity in our Employee Circles, which are composed of employees from throughout the Company, which provide a forum in which to promote topics related to diversity and inclusion focusing on gender, people of color, veterans, disability and LGBTQ+ employees and allies. All employees are encouraged to participate in these Employee Circles at the local and global levels. We have also rolled out training to all employees to support an inclusive culture that values diverse perspectives.  We believe that part of fostering an inclusive and increasingly racially and ethnically diverse workforce requires understanding the makeup of our current employees. As of December\u00a031, 2022, our workforce is:  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n 32% female, with women occupying 34% of company leadership roles (defined as Senior Director or above) compared with 22% in 2017, a 12% increase; and  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n 23% racially and/or ethnically diverse, with 11% of our workforce identifying as Asian, 4% as Black or African American, 7% identifying as Hispanic/Latinx and 1% identifying as two or more races.  Recruitment Waters has focused on expanding diversity in our recruitment processes. We have developed hiring partnerships with agencies such as the National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers, the National Society of Black Engineers, Recruit Military, Out in Tech and Fairygodboss to expand the pipeline of strong candidates. \n\u00a0 10 \n \nIn 2020, the Company opened a new research laboratory in Cambridge, MA, which serves as a strategic, collaborative space in the community, where Waters can partner with academia, research and industry to accelerate the next generation of scientific advancements.

Through online and in-person training programs, we believe that we foster a safe workplace and ensure that all employees are empowered to prevent accidents and injuries.  We manufacture products deemed essential to critical infrastructure, including health and safety, food and agriculture, and energy, and as a result, the majority of our production sites continued operating during the COVID-19 pandemic.  During the pandemic, we invested in maintaining safe work environments for our employees. We responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by, among other things:  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n Adding work from home flexibility;  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n Adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n Increasing cleaning protocols across all work locations;  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n Initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n Establishing new physical distancing and safety procedures for employees who need to be onsite;  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n Modifying workspaces as appropriate;  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n Implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure; and  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n Continuing to modify and evolve our COVID-19 response plan as governments issue new recommendations and guidelines.  Competition The analytical instrument systems, supplies and services market is highly competitive. The Company encounters competition from several worldwide suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets for each of its three primary technologies. The Company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of product performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser extent, price. Competitors continuously introduce new products and have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company\u2019s business. Some competitors have greater financial resources and broader distribution than the Company\u2019s.  In the markets served by Waters, the Company\u2019s principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Bruker Corporation, Danaher Corporation and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. In the markets served by TA, the Company\u2019s principal competitors include: PerkinElmer, Inc., NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern PANalytical Ltd., a subsidiary of Spectris plc, Anton-Paar GmbH and others not identified here.  The market for consumable LC products, including separation columns, is highly competitive and generally more fragmented than the analytical instruments market. The Company encounters competition in the consumable columns market from chemical companies that produce column sorbents and small specialized companies that primarily pack purchased sorbents into columns and subsequently package and distribute columns. The Company believes that it is one of the few suppliers that processes silica and polymeric resins, packs columns and distributes its own products. The Company competes in this market on the basis of performance, reproducibility, reputation and, to a lesser extent, price. In recent years, the Company\u2019s principal competitors for consumable products have included: Danaher Corporation; Merck KGaA; Agilent Technologies, Inc.; General Electric Company and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to offer a predictable level of performance when used with ACQUITY UPLC columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the ACQUITY UPLC instrument base will enhance its chromatographic column business because of the high level of synergy between ACQUITY UPLC columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instruments. \n\u00a0 11 \n \nHealth and Safety The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority.

Certain technology and software has been acquired or is licensed from third parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The Company\u2019s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is, in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss would materially affect the Company\u2019s business as a whole.  Environmental Matters and Climate Change The Company is subject to foreign and U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances that (i)\u00a0govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii)\u00a0impose liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations and has operated its business in the past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. From time to time, Company operations have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its operations, financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws.  The Company is sensitive to the growing global debate with respect to climate change. An internal sustainability working group develops increasingly robust data with respect to the Company\u2019s utilization of carbon producing substances in an effort to continuously reduce the Company\u2019s carbon footprint. In 2019, the Company published a sustainability report identifying the various actions and behaviors the Company adopted in 2018 concerning its commitment to both the environment and the broader topic of social responsibility. The Company has continued to annually publish a sustainability report, including the now-renamed ESG Report that the Company published on November\u00a010, 2022, detailing the Company\u2019s efforts to address its environmental impact and uphold its social responsibilities. See Item 1A, Risk Factors \u2013 The effects of climate change could harm the Company\u2019s business, for more information on the potential significance of climate change legislation.

The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations and has operated its business in the past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. From time to time, Company operations have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its operations, financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws.  The Company is sensitive to the growing global debate with respect to climate change. An internal sustainability working group develops increasingly robust data with respect to the Company\u2019s utilization of carbon producing substances in an effort to continuously reduce the Company\u2019s carbon footprint. In 2019, the Company published a sustainability report identifying the various actions and behaviors the Company adopted in 2018 concerning its commitment to both the environment and the broader topic of social responsibility. The Company has continued to annually publish a sustainability report, including the now-renamed ESG Report that the Company published on November\u00a010, 2022, detailing the Company\u2019s efforts to address its environmental impact and uphold its social responsibilities. See Item 1A, Risk Factors \u2013 The effects of climate change could harm the Company\u2019s business, for more information on the potential significance of climate change legislation.

Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  Item\u00a01A:\u00a0Risk Factors  The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:  RISKS RELATED TO MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS The Company\u2019s international operations may be negatively affected by political events, wars or terrorism, economic conditions and regulatory changes, related to either a specific country or a larger region. These potential political, currency and economic disruptions, as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. Approximately 70% and 72% of the Company\u2019s net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively, were outside of the United States and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies. During 2022, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against all other major currencies in the world, which resulted in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacting the Company\u2019s sales growth by 5% and earnings per diluted share growth by 9% or $1.00. In addition, the Company has considerable manufacturing operations in Ireland and the U.K., as well as significant subcontractors located in Singapore. As a result, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s sales and operations are subject to certain risks, including adverse developments in the political, regulatory and economic environment, in particular, uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic trade policy; the effect of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of European countries; impact and costs of terrorism or war, in particular as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the possibility of further escalation resulting in new geopolitical and regulatory instability; the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency; sudden movements in a country\u2019s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country\u2019s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices; trade protection measures including embargoes, sanctions and tariffs; differing tax laws and changes in those laws; restrictions on investments and/or limitations regarding foreign ownership; nationalization of private enterprises which may result in the confiscation of assets; credit risk and uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; the impact of global health pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19; difficulties in protecting intellectual property; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and associated adverse operational, contractual and tax consequences. \n\u00a0 14 \n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n risks associated with cybersecurity and technology, including attempts by third parties to defeat the security measures of the Company and its third-party partners;  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n increased regulatory burdens as the Company\u2019s business evolves, especially with respect to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, among others, and in connection with government contracts;  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company\u2019s products, completion of purchase order documentation and the ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives;  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n risks associated with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings; and  \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\n\u00a0\n the impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) in the U.S.; and shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates.
