MiFID II also significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction reporting and investor protection, and introduced a position limits and reporting regime for commodities. In November 2021, the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) published a draft legislative proposal for amendments to MiFID II focused on changes to rules related to transparency and market structure, including the proposed creation of a consolidated tape intended to increase transparency into trading across the EU by providing a centralized source of market data. This legislation remains subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council.  In the U.K., MiFID II is being amended through the \u201cWholesale Markets Review\u201d, a set of proposals designed to streamline and improve regulation of the U.K. secondary markets following the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU. Some of the changes, such as the removal of the requirement to execute trades in shares on certain trading venues, have been introduced through the Financial Services and Markets Bill (\u201cFSMB\u201d), which is expected to be passed by the U.K. Parliament in the first half of 2023. Other changes, such as amendments to MiFID II rules related to transparency, will be subject to further consultation, which is expected during 2023.  7 7 7 7 Part I Part I In December 2022, the EC published a legislative proposal to amend EMIR to increase the competitiveness of the EU central clearing framework and to enhance supervision of EU central counterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d). These proposals are subject to further review by the European Parliament and European Council. The EU has adopted mandatory buy-in rules under the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (\u201cCSDR\u201d) which will impose requirements relating to sourcing of securities in the event of a settlement fail. In June 2022, EU regulators proposed an amendment to postpone the application of these rules until November 2025. The amendment remains subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council.In December 2022, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an extensive package of reforms to U.K. financial services regulation known as the \u201cEdinburgh Reforms\u201d. These reforms aim to drive growth and competitiveness in the U.K. financial services sector following the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU. The reform package includes initiatives relating to a number of areas of financial services policy, including retail banks, payments, markets, digital assets and sustainable finance. The U.K. Government and regulators are expected to release further consultations and announcements related to these reforms in 2023.EU and U.K. regulators are expected to finalize the rules implementing the Basel III framework during 2023. The Firm\u2019s banking entities in the EU and the U.K. will be required to comply with the Basel III final rules by January 2025, allowing for certain transitional arrangements until 2030 and 2032, respectively. The main changes implemented by the Basel III final rules will be revisions to the credit risk and operational risk calculation methods to reduce the use of and reliance on internal modelling approaches and introduce internationally-agreed changes to the market risk framework. The EU Basel III final rules also strengthen enforcement tools for supervisors overseeing EU banks and require EU banking entities to systematically identify, disclose and manage environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) risks as part of their risk management practices. In addition, in December 2022, the European Banking Authority (\u201cEBA\u201d) announced that it will publish rules and technical standards between 2023 and 2025 related to sustainable finance, which will be applicable to EU banks. The Firm\u2019s banking entities in the U.K. will be required to comply with regulatory policies and standards related to climate risk being developed by the PRA. In addition, EU legislation requires that certain non-EU banks operating in the EU establish an intermediate parent undertaking (\u201cIPU\u201d) located in the EU. The IPU legislation allows a second IPU to be established if a single IPU would conflict with \u201chome country\u201d bank separation rules or impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to comply with the EU\u2019s IPU requirements by December 30, 2023.The Firm\u2019s banking entities in the EU and U.K. are also subject to supervisory expectations published by the ECB and the PRA, respectively, for management of financial risks arising from climate change and the increasing operational reliance on IT systems, third-party services and innovative technologies, as well as supervisory expectations for operational resilience and resilience from macro-financial and geopolitical shocks. These expectations address bank strategy, governance, risk management, scenario analysis, risk reporting and disclosure. Policymakers in the EU have continued to implement sustainability-related initiatives. In December 2022, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (\u201cCSRD\u201d) was published in the Official Journal of the EU. The CSRD will replace and significantly expand the scope and content of ESG reporting requirements under the EU\u2019s existing ESG reporting rules. CSRD reporting requirements will be phased in beginning in 2024. In addition, the EC published its legislative proposal on the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (\u201cCSDDD\u201d) in February 2022. The draft directive sets mandatory due diligence obligations for companies to address actual and potential human rights violations and environmental adverse impacts stemming from their own operations and business relationships, including the activities of companies with which they have established business relationships. The proposed legislation may also require the adoption of company-specific climate-related transition plans. The CSDDD is currently subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council. Both the CSRD and CSDDD will apply to certain of the Firm\u2019s EU entities as well as to certain non-EU entities.
