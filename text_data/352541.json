The following includes the primary regulations impacting Alliant Energy\u2019s, IPL\u2019s and WPL\u2019s businesses.  FERC - Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 - Alliant Energy is registered with FERC as a public utility holding company, pursuant to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, and is required to maintain certain records and to report certain transactions involving its public utilities, service company and other entities regulated by FERC.  Corporate Services, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 for various matters including, but not limited to, affiliate transactions, public utility mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, and books, records and accounting requirements.  5 5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Energy Policy Act of 2005 - The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires creation of an Electric Reliability Organization to provide oversight by FERC.  FERC designated North American Electric Reliability Corporation as the overarching Electric Reliability Organization.  Midwest Reliability Organization, which is a regional member of North American Electric Reliability Corporation, has direct responsibility for mandatory electric reliability standards for IPL and WPL.  Federal Power Act of 1935 - FERC also has jurisdiction, under the Federal Power Act of 1935, over certain electric utility facilities and operations, electric wholesale sales, interstate electric transmission rates, dividend payments, issuance of IPL\u2019s securities, and accounting practices of Corporate Services, IPL and WPL.  Electric Wholesale Rates - FERC has authority over IPL's and WPL's wholesale electric market-based rates.  Market-based rate authorization allows for wholesale sales of electricity within FERC\u2019s wholesale markets, including the MISO market, and in transactions directly with third parties, based on the market value of the transactions.  IPL and WPL also have FERC-approved cost of service formula-based rates related to the provision of firm full- and partial-requirement wholesale electric sales, which allow for true-ups to actual costs, including fuel costs.  Electric Transmission Rates - FERC regulates the rates charged for electric transmission facilities used in interstate commerce.  IPL and WPL do not own or operate FERC-regulated electric transmission facilities; however, both IPL and WPL pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system based upon FERC-regulated rates.  IPL and WPL rely primarily on the use of the ITC and ATC transmission systems, respectively.  Natural Gas Act - FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act.  Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over certain natural gas facilities and operations of IPL and WPL.  IUB - IPL is subject to regulation by the IUB for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, the construction of EGUs, and the acquisition, sale or lease of assets with values that exceed 3% of IPL\u2019s revenues.  In 2021, legislation was enacted in Iowa prohibiting counties and cities from regulating the sale of natural gas and propane, which supports IPL\u2019s ability to provide gas utility service to a diversified base of retail customers and industries.  Retail Utility Base Rates - IPL files periodic requests with the IUB for retail rate changes and may base those requests on either historical or forward-looking test periods.  The IUB must decide on requests for retail rate changes within 10 months of the date of the application for which changes are filed.  The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain known and measurable changes to capital investments, cost of capital and operating and maintenance expenses consistent with IUB rules and regulations.  In 2021, the IUB adopted rules that establish minimum filing requirements for rate reviews using a forward-looking test period, and a related subsequent proceeding review after the close of the forward-looking test period.  The rules provide that in the subsequent proceeding review, a utility\u2019s actual costs and revenues will be presumed to be reasonably consistent with the forward-looking test period if the utility\u2019s actual return on common equity falls within a standard of reasonableness of 50 basis points above to 50 basis points below the authorized return on common equity.  If the utility\u2019s actual return on common equity is outside of this range, future rates could be adjusted.  In addition, the rules require that IPL must receive an order from the IUB related to the subsequent proceeding review before it can file another rate review.  Energy Efficiency - In accordance with Iowa law, IPL is required to file an EEP every five years with the IUB.  An EEP provides a utility\u2019s plan and related budget to achieve specified levels of electric and gas energy savings.  IUB approval demonstrates that IPL\u2019s EEP is reasonably expected to achieve cost-effective delivery of the energy efficiency programs.  Refer to Note 1(g) for discussion of the recovery of these costs from IPL\u2019s retail electric and gas customers.  Electric Generating Units - IPL must obtain a certificate of public convenience, use and necessity (GCU Certificate) from the IUB in order to construct a new, or significantly alter (including fuel switching) an existing, EGU located in Iowa with 25 MW or more of nameplate generating capacity.  IPL\u2019s ownership and operation of EGUs (including those located outside the state of Iowa) to serve Iowa customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the IUB.  Gas Pipeline Projects - IPL must obtain a pipeline permit from the IUB related to the siting of utility gas pipelines in Iowa that will be operated at a pressure over 150 pounds per square inch and will transport gas to a distribution system or single, large volume customer.  Advance Rate-making Principles - Iowa law allows Iowa utilities to request rate-making principles prior to making certain generation investments in Iowa.  As a result, IPL may file for, and the IUB must render a decision on, rate-making principles for certain new EGUs located in Iowa, including any alternative energy production facility (such as a wind or solar facility, as well as battery storage constructed in combination with these facilities), combined-cycle natural gas-fired EGU, and certain base-load EGUs with a nameplate generating capacity of 300 MW or more (such as nuclear-fired generation).  Stand-alone battery storage facilities will be considered for advance rate-making principles on a case-by-case basis.  Advance rate-making principles are also available for the repowering of an alternative energy production facility or certain significant alterations of an existing EGU.  Upon approval of rate-making principles by the IUB, IPL must either construct the EGU or repower the alternative energy production facility under the approved rate-making principles, or not at all.  If rate-making principles are not  6 6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents approved by the IUB, IPL may construct the facility, subject to other applicable approvals (such as a GCU Certificate), subject to recovery in future rate reviews.  Electric Generating Unit Environmental Controls Projects - IPL is required to submit an updated emissions plan and budget biennially to the IUB setting out a multi-year plan and budget for managing regulated emissions from its coal-fired EGUs in a cost-effective manner.  IPL must simultaneously submit this plan and budget to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources for a determination of whether the plan and budget meet state environmental requirements for regulated emissions.  The reasonable and prudent costs associated with implementing the approved plan are expected to be included in IPL\u2019s future retail electric rates.  PSCW - WPL is subject to regulation by the PSCW related to its operations in Wisconsin for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities, affiliate transactions, approval of the location and construction of EGUs and certain other additions and extensions to facilities.  In addition, Alliant Energy is subject to regulation by the PSCW for the type and amount of Alliant Energy\u2019s holdings in non-utility businesses and other affiliated interest activities, among other matters.  Retail Utility Base Rates - WPL files periodic requests with the PSCW for retail rate changes, which are based on forward-looking test periods.  There is no statutory time limit for the PSCW to decide on retail base rate requests.  However, the PSCW attempts to process retail base rate reviews in approximately 10 months and has the ability to approve interim retail rate relief, subject to refund, if necessary.  Currently, WPL is required to defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds certain levels.  Through 2023, any such deferral is required to be offset against the remaining net book value of Edgewater Unit 5, which is currently expected to be retired by June 1, 2025.  Public Benefits - WPL contributes 1.2% of its annual retail utility revenues to help fund Focus on Energy, Wisconsin\u2019s state-wide energy efficiency and renewable energy resource program.  In addition, WPL contributes to a program that provides assistance to income-eligible residents in Wisconsin.  These contributions are recovered from customers through a monthly bill surcharge of the lesser of 3% of customers\u2019 utilities bills or $750.  Refer to Note 1(g) for discussion of the recovery of these costs from WPL\u2019s retail electric and gas customers.  New Electric Generating Units - A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any new EGU (including battery storage) with a capacity of less than 100 MW and a project cost of $12.4 million or more.  WPL must obtain a CPCN from the PSCW in order to construct a new EGU in Wisconsin with a capacity of 100 MW or more.  In addition, WPL\u2019s ownership and operation of EGUs (including those located outside the state of Wisconsin) to serve Wisconsin customers are subject to retail utility rate regulation by the PSCW.  Electric Generating Unit Upgrades and Electric Distribution Projects - A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any additions to EGUs, including environmental controls projects, as well as electric distribution projects, with estimated project costs of $12.4 million or more.  Gas Distribution Projects - A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of gas projects with an estimated project cost of $5.9 million or more and at any time that WPL requests to extend gas service to a new portion of its service territory.  Advance Rate-making Principles - Wisconsin law provides Wisconsin utilities with the opportunity to request rate-making principles prior to the purchase or construction of any EGU utilized to serve Wisconsin customers.  WPL is not obligated to file for or accept authorized rate-making principles under Wisconsin law.  WPL can proceed with an approved project under traditional rate-making terms or accept authorized rate-making principles under Wisconsin law.  Department of Homeland Security Transportation Security Administration - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation for physical and cyber security of their natural gas pipeline systems, and are applying, and monitoring for changes to, these requirements to their pipeline systems.  Environmental - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation of environmental matters by federal, state and local authorities as a result of their current and past operations.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL monitor these environmental matters and address them by installing controls that reduce emissions and by implementing operational modifications or other measures to address compliance obligations.  There is currently significant regulatory uncertainty with respect to environmental rules and regulations discussed below.  Given the evolving nature of environmental regulations and other related regulatory requirements, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL develop and periodically update their compliance plans to address these environmental obligations.  Prudent expenditures incurred by IPL and WPL to comply with environmental requirements are eligible to be recovered in rates from their customers.  The following are major environmental matters that could potentially have a significant impact on financial condition and results of operations.  7 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Air Quality - Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Regulations - In 2007, the Supreme Court provided direction on the EPA\u2019s authority to regulate GHG and ruled that these emissions are covered by the CAA.  In 2009, the EPA issued a ruling that found GHG emissions contribute to climate change, and therefore, threaten public health and welfare, which was the prerequisite for implementing CO2 reduction standards under the CAA.  While the EPA\u2019s rules to regulate GHG issued under the authority of the CAA remain subject to further review, growing emphasis on climate change and evolving energy technologies are driving efforts to decarbonize the environment through voluntary emissions reductions.  The primary GHG directly emitted from Alliant Energy\u2019s utility operations is CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels at its EGUs.  Clean Air Act Section 111(d) - In 2015, the EPA issued the Clean Power Plan under Section 111(d) of the CAA to reduce CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled EGUs through broad electricity system-wide measures.  This was replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy rule in 2019, to reduce CO2 emissions from existing coal-fueled EGUs through heat rate improvements.  In 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the Affordable Clean Energy rule to the EPA for reconsideration.  In 2022, the Supreme Court issued a ruling limiting the extent of the EPA\u2019s authority under Section 111(d) to emissions reduction technologies and operational improvements.  The EPA is working on a new set of Section 111(d) emission guidelines for states to implement Best System of Emission Reduction standards for GHG emissions from existing fossil-fueled EGUs, and has stated that it intends to issue a proposed rule in 2023 and a final rule in 2024, although a timeline cannot be predicted with certainty.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these matters.  Clean Air Act Section 111(b) - In 2015, the EPA published final standards under Section 111(b) of the CAA, which establish CO2 emissions limits for certain new fossil-fueled EGUs.  Marshalltown and West Riverside are subject to the EPA\u2019s Section 111(b) regulation and have been designed to achieve compliance with these standards.  The EPA is reviewing the Section 111(b) standards, and has stated it intends to issue a proposed rule in 2023 and a final rule in 2024, although a timeline cannot be predicted with certainty.  Litigation related to Section 111(b) is suspended while the EPA revises its Section 111(b) regulations, and Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of these standards.  Cross-State Air Pollution Rule - CSAPR is a regional sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides cap-and-trade program, where compliance with emission limits may be achieved by purchasing emission allowances and/or reducing emissions through changes in operations or the additions of environmental controls.  CSAPR emission allowances may be banked for future year compliance.  CSAPR establishes state-specific annual sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emission caps and ozone season nitrogen oxides emission caps.  In 2022, the EPA proposed revisions to the CSAPR state-specific ozone season nitrogen oxides emission caps and utility-specific emission allowances for certain states, including Wisconsin, beginning in 2023.  The proposed rule does not apply to Iowa; however, Iowa could be included in the final rule, which is currently expected in 2023.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these matters.  Water Quality - Effluent Limitation Guidelines - In 2015, the EPA published final effluent limitation guidelines, which required changes to discharge limits for wastewater from certain IPL and WPL steam EGUs.  In 2020, revised effluent limitation guidelines (2020 Reconsideration Rule) became effective, which incorporated flexibility to the 2015 rule, including a new subcategory for coal-fired EGUs that will be retired or converted to no longer burn coal before 2028.  Compliance for existing steam-electric generating facilities is determined by each facility\u2019s wastewater discharge permit and will generally be required by December 31, 2025.  Projects required for compliance are facility-specific.  In 2021, the current Presidential Administration issued an Executive Order requiring the review and possible revision of environmental regulations issued during the prior Administration.  As a result, the EPA expects to undertake a supplemental rule-making to revise the guidelines for steam-electric generating facilities.  As part of the rule-making process, the EPA is expected to determine whether more stringent limitations and standards are appropriate.  The 2020 Reconsideration Rule will remain in effect while the EPA undertakes this new rule-making.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of the anticipated supplemental rule-making.  Land and Solid Waste - Coal Combustion Residuals Rule - The CCR Rule, which became effective in 2015, regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste.  IPL and WPL have coal-fired EGUs with coal ash ponds and active CCR landfills that are impacted by this rule.  Compliance obligations associated with the CCR Rule may be subject to change due to future EPA CCR Rule updates, on-going litigation related to the CCR Rule, and any actions taken to-date that may be challenged.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of these updates.  Manufactured Gas Plant Sites - Refer to Note 17(e) for discussion of IPL\u2019s and WPL\u2019s MGP sites.  Renewable Energy Standards - Iowa and Wisconsin have renewable energy standards, which establish the minimum amount of energy IPL and WPL must supply from renewable resources.  IPL primarily relies upon renewable energy generated from the wind resources it owns and renewable energy acquired under PPAs to meet these requirements.  WPL utilizes its current renewable portfolio, which primarily consists of wind, solar and hydro energy, both owned and acquired under PPAs, to meet these requirements.  IPL and WPL currently exceed their respective renewable energy standards requirements.  8 8 8 8  Table of Contents Table of Contents 3) STRATEGY - Refer to \u201cOverview\u201d in MDA for discussion of Alliant Energy\u2019s strategy, which supports its mission to deliver energy solutions and exceptional service that its customers and communities count on - affordably, safely, reliably and sustainably.   C. INFORMATION RELATING TO UTILITY OPERATIONS Alliant Energy\u2019s utility business (IPL and WPL) has three segments: a) electric operations; b) gas operations; and c) other, which includes IPL\u2019s steam operations and the unallocated portions of the utility business.  IPL\u2019s and WPL\u2019s electric, gas and other revenues as a percentage of total revenues were as follows: IPLWPL   1) ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS General - Electric utility operations represent the largest operating segment for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.  Alliant Energy\u2019s electric utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL providing retail electric service in Iowa and WPL providing retail and wholesale electric service in Wisconsin.  IPL also sells electricity to wholesale customers in Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa.  Refer to the \u201cElectric Operating Information\u201d tables for additional details regarding electric utility operations.  Customers - IPL and WPL provide electric utility service to a diversified base of retail customers in several industries, with the largest concentrations in the farming, agriculture, industrial manufacturing, chemical (including ethanol), packaging and food industries.  IPL and WPL also sell electricity to wholesale customers, which primarily consist of municipalities and rural electric cooperatives.  Seasonality - Electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning requirements.  Electric sales are also impacted to a certain extent in the winter months due to heating requirements.  Competition - Retail electric customers in Iowa and Wisconsin currently do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier, and IPL and WPL have obligations to serve all their retail electric customers.  Although electric service in Iowa and Wisconsin is regulated, IPL and WPL still face competition from self-generation by large industrial customers, customer- and third party-owned generation (e.g. solar panels), alternative energy sources, and petitions to municipalize (Iowa) as well as service territory expansions by municipal utilities through annexations (Wisconsin).  In addition, the wholesale power market is competitive and IPL and WPL compete against independent power producers, other utilities and MISO market purchases to serve wholesale customers for their electric energy and capacity needs.  Alliant Energy\u2019s strategy includes actions to retain current customers and attract new customers into IPL\u2019s and WPL\u2019s service territories in an effort to keep energy rates low for all of their customers.  Refer to \u201cOverview\u201d in MDA for discussion of the strategy element focusing on growing customer demand.  Electric Supply - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have met, and expect to continue meeting, customer demand of electricity through a mix of electric supply, including owned EGUs, PPAs and additional purchases from wholesale energy markets.  Alliant Energy expects its mix of electric supply to change in the next several years with its planned transition away from coal-fired EGUs by considering additional renewable energy such as solar generation, repowering of existing wind farms and distributed energy resources, including community solar and energy storage systems, natural gas resources, and the actual and potential sale of partial interests in West Riverside to neighboring utilities.  Long-term generation plans are intended to meet customer demand, reduce air emissions and water impacts, reduce reliance on wholesale market purchases and mitigate the impacts of future EGU retirements while maintaining compliance with long-term electric demand planning reserve margins, renewable energy standards established by regulators and other various requirements.  Electric Demand Planning Reserve Margin - IPL and WPL are required to maintain a planning reserve margin above their load at the time of the MISO-wide peak to ensure reliability of electric service to their customers.  IPL and WPL utilize accredited capacity from EGUs they own, and have rights to through PPAs, to meet a substantial portion of their current MISO planning reserve margin requirements and periodically rely on short-term market capacity purchases to supplement the accredited capacity from such EGUs.  Refer to \u201cCustomer Investments\u201d in MDA for discussion of MISO\u2019s new seasonal resource adequacy process establishing capacity planning reserve margin and capacity accreditation requirements effective with the June 1, 2023 through May 31, 2024 MISO Planning Year.

Refer to \u201cProperties\u201d in Item 2 for details of IPL\u2019s and WPL\u2019s EGUs.  The average cost of delivered fuel per million British Thermal Units used for electric generation was as follows: IPLWPL202220212020202220212020All fuels$4.37$2.10$2.22$4.47$2.62$2.36Natural gas (a)5.762.542.546.023.312.51Coal2.311.811.842.432.072.19  (a)The average cost of natural gas includes commodity and transportation costs, as well as realized gains and losses from swap and option contracts used to hedge the price of natural gas volumes expected to be used by IPL\u2019s and WPL\u2019s natural gas-fired EGUs.  Natural Gas - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL own several natural gas-fired EGUs, and WPL also has exclusive rights to the output of AEF\u2019s Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility under an affiliated lease agreement.  These facilities help meet customer demand for electricity when natural gas prices are low enough to make natural gas-fired generation economical compared to other fuel sources.  Alliant Energy manages the gas supply to these gas-fired EGUs and helps ensure an adequate supply is available at known prices through a combination of gas commodity, pipeline transportation and storage agreements held by IPL and WPL for numerous years.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they are reasonably insulated against gas price volatility for these EGUs given their use of forward contracts and hedging practices, as well as their regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms.  Coal - Coal is one of the fuel sources for owned EGUs.  Coal contracts entered into with different entities help ensure that a specified supply of coal is available, and delivered, at known prices for IPL\u2019s and WPL\u2019s coal-fired EGUs.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe their coal supply portfolio represents a reasonable balance between the risks of insufficient supplies and those associated with being unable to respond to future coal market changes.  Remaining coal requirements are expected to be met from either future term contracts or purchases in the spot market.  Currently, all of the coal utilized by IPL and WPL is from the Wyoming Powder River Basin.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they are reasonably insulated against coal price volatility given their current coal procurement process, the specific coal market in their primary purchase region and regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms.  The coal procurement process supports periodic purchases, staggering of contract terms, stair-stepped levels of supply going forward and supplier diversity.  Similarly, given the term lengths of their transportation agreements and strategic alignment of agreement expirations for negotiation purposes, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they are reasonably insulated against future higher coal transportation rates from the major railroads.  Purchased Power - IPL and WPL periodically enter into PPAs and purchase electricity from wholesale energy markets to meet a portion of their customer demand for electricity.  Electric Transmission - IPL and WPL do not own electric transmission service assets and currently receive transmission services from ITC and ATC, respectively.  ITC and ATC are independent, for-profit, transmission-only companies and are transmission-owning members of the MISO Regional Transmission Organization, Midwest Reliability Organization and Reliability First Corporation Regional Entities.  The annual transmission service rates that ITC or ATC charges their customers are calculated each calendar year using a FERC-approved cost of service formula rate.  As a result, ITC and ATC can implement new rates each calendar year without filing a request with FERC.  However, new rates are subject to challenge by either FERC or customers.  If the rates proposed by ITC or ATC are determined by FERC to be unjust or unreasonable, or another mechanism is determined by FERC to be just and reasonable, ITC\u2019s or ATC\u2019s rates would change accordingly.  Refer to Note 1(g) for discussion of a transmission cost rider utilized by IPL for recovery of its electric transmission service expense, and discussion of WPL\u2019s escrow for recovery of electric transmission service expense, which is recovered from its retail electric customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings.  Refer to Note 17(g) for discussion of a court decision, which is currently expected to reduce the base return on equity authorized for MISO transmission owners, including ATC.  10 10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents MISO Markets - IPL and WPL are members of MISO, a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Organization, which is responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the transmission system in their footprint.  IPL and WPL participate in the wholesale energy and ancillary services markets operated by MISO, which are discussed in more detail below.  As agent for IPL and WPL, Corporate Services enters into energy, capacity, ancillary services, and transmission sale and purchase transactions within MISO.  Corporate Services assigns such sales and purchases between IPL and WPL based on statements received from MISO.  Wholesale Energy Market - IPL and WPL sell and purchase power in the day-ahead and real-time wholesale energy markets operated by MISO.  MISO\u2019s bid/offer-based markets compare the cost of IPL and WPL generation against other generators, which affects IPL and WPL generation operations, energy purchases and energy sales.  MISO generally dispatches the lowest cost generators, while recognizing current system constraints, to reduce costs for purchasers in the wholesale energy market.  In addition, MISO may dispatch generators that support reliability needs, but that would not have operated based on economic needs.  In these cases, MISO\u2019s settlement assures that these generators are made whole financially for their variable costs.  Ancillary Services Market - IPL and WPL also participate in MISO\u2019s ancillary services market, which integrates the procurement and use of regulation and contingency reserves with the existing wholesale energy market to ensure reliability of electricity supply.  MISO\u2019s ancillary services market has had the overall impact of lowering ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint.  Financial Transmission Rights and Auction Revenue Rights - In areas of constrained transmission capacity, energy costs could be higher due to congestion and its impact on locational marginal prices.  FTRs provide a hedge for certain congestion costs that occur in the MISO energy market.  MISO allocates auction revenue rights to IPL and WPL annually based on a fiscal year from June 1 through May 31 and historical use of the transmission system.  The allocated auction revenue rights are used by IPL and WPL to acquire FTRs through the FTR auctions operated by MISO.  Resource Adequacy - MISO has resource adequacy requirements to help ensure adequate resources to meet forecasted peak load obligations plus a reserve margin.  Only accredited capacity assigned to EGUs is available to meet these requirements.  In order for an EGU to receive accredited capacity, it must meet MISO capacity accreditation requirements, which can include satisfying transmission requirements identified in its interconnection agreement prior to the MISO planning year.  Refer to \u201cCustomer Investments\u201d in MDA for discussion of MISO\u2019s new seasonal resource adequacy process establishing capacity planning reserve margin and capacity accreditation requirements effective with the 2023/2024 MISO Planning Year.  11 11 11 11  Table of Contents Table of Contents Electric Operating Information - Alliant Energy202220212020Revenues (in millions):Residential$1,233\u00a0$1,115\u00a0$1,093\u00a0Commercial821\u00a0763\u00a0718\u00a0Industrial965\u00a0893\u00a0841\u00a0Retail subtotal3,019\u00a02,771\u00a02,652\u00a0Sales for resale:Wholesale233\u00a0187\u00a0168\u00a0Bulk power and other111\u00a056\u00a036\u00a0Other58\u00a067\u00a064\u00a0Total$3,421\u00a0$3,081\u00a0$2,920\u00a0Sales (000s MWh):Residential7,479\u00a07,353\u00a07,294\u00a0Commercial6,436\u00a06,383\u00a06,107\u00a0Industrial11,494\u00a011,696\u00a011,134\u00a0Retail subtotal25,409\u00a025,432\u00a024,535\u00a0Sales for resale:Wholesale2,866\u00a02,787\u00a02,525\u00a0Bulk power and other3,734\u00a03,018\u00a03,521\u00a0Other62\u00a071\u00a071\u00a0Total32,071\u00a031,308\u00a030,652\u00a0Customers (End of Period):Retail989,369\u00a0981,570\u00a0974,144\u00a0Other2,903\u00a02,878\u00a02,841\u00a0Total992,272\u00a0984,448\u00a0976,985\u00a0Other Selected Electric Data:Maximum summer peak hour demand (MW)5,629\u00a05,486\u00a05,496\u00a0Maximum winter peak hour demand (MW)4,415\u00a04,413\u00a04,158\u00a0Cooling degree days (a):Cedar Rapids, Iowa (IPL) (normal - 807)908\u00a0974\u00a0800\u00a0Madison, Wisconsin (WPL) (normal - 695)787\u00a0845\u00a0736\u00a0Sources of electric energy (000s MWh):Gas11,438\u00a010,055\u00a010,440\u00a0Purchased power:Wind (b)4,422\u00a03,529\u00a03,683\u00a0Nuclear\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a02,347\u00a0Other (b)2,803\u00a02,642\u00a02,521\u00a0Wind (b)6,424\u00a05,231\u00a04,872\u00a0Coal7,416\u00a010,218\u00a07,021\u00a0Other (b)239\u00a0226\u00a0254\u00a0Total32,742\u00a031,901\u00a031,138\u00a0Revenue per KWh sold to retail customers (cents)11.88\u00a010.90\u00a010.81\u00a0 (a)Cooling degree days are calculated using a simple average of the high and low temperatures each day compared to a 65 degree base.

Alliant Energy\u2019s gas utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL providing gas service in Iowa and WPL providing gas service in Wisconsin.  Refer to the \u201cGas Operating Information\u201d tables for additional details regarding gas utility operations.  Refer to Note 1(g) for information relating to utility natural gas cost recovery mechanisms and Note 17(b) for discussion of natural gas commitments.  Customers - IPL and WPL provide gas utility service to a diversified base of retail customers and industries, including research, education, hospitality, manufacturing and chemicals (including ethanol).  In addition, IPL and WPL provide transportation service to commercial and industrial customers by moving customer-owned gas through Alliant Energy\u2019s distribution systems to the customers\u2019 meters.  Seasonality - Gas sales follow a seasonal pattern with an annual base-load of gas and a large heating peak occurring during the winter season.  Natural gas obtained from producers, marketers and brokers, as well as gas in storage, is utilized to meet the peak heating season requirements.  Storage contracts generally allow IPL and WPL to purchase gas in the summer and inject it into underground storage fields, and remove it from storage fields in the winter to deliver to customers.  Competition - Gas customers in Iowa and Wisconsin currently do not have the ability to choose their gas distributor, and IPL and WPL have obligations to serve all their gas customers.  While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a regulated function, sales of the natural gas commodity and related services are subject to competition from third-parties who provide alternative fuel sources (e.g. propane).  However, when natural gas service is available for a given area, customers in such area have generally selected natural gas over propane as a more cost competitive solution for their fuel needs.  Refer to \u201cCustomer Investments\u201d in MDA for discussion of plans to expand gas distribution systems.  Gas Supply - IPL and WPL maintain purchase agreements with numerous suppliers of natural gas from various gas producing regions of the U.S. and Canada.  In providing gas commodity service to retail customers, Corporate Services administers a diversified portfolio of transportation and storage contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL.  The tariffs for IPL\u2019s and WPL\u2019s retail gas customers provide for subsequent adjustments to their rates for the cost of gas sold to these customers.  As a result, natural gas prices do not have a material impact on IPL\u2019s or WPL\u2019s gas margins.  Gas Demand Planning Reserve Margin - IPL and WPL are required to maintain adequate pipeline capacity to ensure they meet their customers\u2019 maximum daily system demand requirements.
