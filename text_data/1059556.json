As part of this effort, Moody\u2019s advances sustainability by considering environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors in its operations, products and services. The Company uses its expertise and assets to make a positive difference through technology tools, research and analytical services that help other organizations and the investor community better understand the links between sustainability considerations and the global markets. Moody\u2019s efforts to promote sustainability-related thought leadership, assessments and data to market participants include adhering to the policies of recognized sustainability organizations that develop standards or frameworks and/or evaluate and assess performance, including: the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB); and the World Economic Forum (WEF)\u2019s Stakeholder Capitalism metrics. Moody's also issues an annual report on Stakeholder Sustainability and its implementation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) recommendations. Moody\u2019s sustainability-related achievements in 2022 included the following: \u2013Validated Moody\u2019s long-term net-zero targets with SBTi; \u2013Rolled out an all-employee training on Sustainability and ESG; \u2013Received the following awards/recognition: i) featured on the 2022 CDP \u2018A List\u2019 for Climate Action for third consecutive year; ii) included in FTSE4Good Index Series for the fourth consecutive year; iii) received \u2018Net Zero Transition\u2019 award from Reuters Responsible Business; iv) named \u2018Climate Leader\u2019 by the Finance of the Future Awards; v) awarded 'Best ESG Reporting (large-cap)' from IR Magazine U.S. 2022; vi) received \u2018Sustainability reporting of the year \u2013 Americas\u2019 from Environmental Finance Company Awards 2022; and vii) included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time; \u2013Published Moody\u2019s 2021 Stakeholder Sustainability report and 2021 TCFD report; and \u2013Issued a global tax policy. The Board oversees sustainability matters, with assistance from the Audit, Governance & Nominating and Compensation & Human Resources Committees, as part of its oversight of management and the Company\u2019s overall strategy. The Audit Committee oversees financial, risk and other disclosures made in the Company\u2019s annual and quarterly reports related to sustainability and has overseen the expanded voluntary disclosures the Company has made in its periodic filings. The Governance & Nominating Committee oversees sustainability matters, including significant issues of corporate social and environmental responsibility, as they pertain to the Company\u2019s business and to long-term value creation for the Company and its stockholders, and makes recommendations to the Board regarding these issues. This has helped to develop the Company\u2019s robust ESG strategy. Finally, the Compensation & Human Resources Committee oversees inclusion of sustainability-related performance goals for determining compensation of all senior executives. This oversight has resulted in the Company more fully integrating sustainability-related performance metrics into the strategic & operational compensation metric of all senior executives. The Board also oversees Moody\u2019s policies for assessing and managing the Company's exposure to risk, including climate-related risks such as business continuity disruption and reputational or credibility concerns stemming from incorporation of climate-related risks into the credit methodologies and credit ratings of MIS.

As a global integrated risk assessment firm, attracting, supporting and retaining skilled talent is essential to the Company\u2019s success. Moody\u2019s addresses these goals by: \u2013championing DE&I among employees;  \u2013providing market-competitive compensation, benefits and wellness programs; and   \u2013advancing employee engagement, including supporting employee learning, development and skills enhancement.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) Moody's believes it is imperative to be visible champions of DE&I because differing thoughts and perspectives help to enrich the Company\u2019s offerings to its many stakeholders and improve performance and retention. The key objectives for which the Company focuses with respect to these items include:  \u2013incorporating DE&I into Moody\u2019s business strategy;  \u2013establishing leadership accountability with respect to diversity, including through executive compensation programs;  \u2013working to increase diverse representation (e.g., women and underrepresented groups);  \u2013continuing to advance women and underrepresented employees in leadership roles;  \u2013enhancing employee training in DE&I matters;  \u2013promoting equal employment opportunities in all aspects of employment;  \u2013designing the Company\u2019s compensation practices to provide equal pay for equal work; and  \u2013incorporating market standards, role, experience and performance into compensation decisions.  The executive leadership team\u2019s focus on these items is vital to attract, support and retain its skilled talent. Additionally, an Executive Diversity Council is tasked with overseeing the implementation and progression of the DE&I strategy and goals across our business. Chaired by our CEO and composed of senior leaders who are committed to DE&I best practices, the members of the council meet quarterly so that DE&I policies are an ongoing focus throughout the company.  14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MOODY'S 2022 10-K 14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MOODY'S 2022 10-K 14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MOODY'S 2022 10-K Table of Contents Table of Contents Moody\u2019s has numerous diversity programs and eleven active business resource groups (\u201cBRGs\u201d) that contribute to a more effective and inclusive work environment by fostering the recruitment, development and retention of diverse and talented individuals. The BRGs represent 53 chapters and more than 3,600 employees participating globally as of December\u00a031, 2022. The Company\u2019s diversity programs are designed to expand Moody\u2019s talent pipeline and include the TIDE program (Talent Aspirations & Alignment, Insights, Development & Career Planning and Exposure & Expansion), which is a high potential employee diversity initiative aimed at elevating women and ethnically diverse employees at the Senior Vice President/Senior Director level and above; and RISE, a global program for women at the Vice President/Director level focused on addressing the unique challenges of women in the workplace.  The Company provides and periodically updates information on its BRGs and other diversity, inclusion and equity programs in its various sustainability and stakeholder reports and on its DE&I microsite.

Compensation, Health and Wellness Moody\u2019s compensation programs are designed to foster and maintain a strong, capable, experienced and motivated global workforce. An important element of the Company\u2019s compensation philosophy is aligning compensation to local market standards so that Moody's can attract and retain the highly-skilled talent needed to thrive. The Company\u2019s compensation packages include market-competitive salaries, annual bonuses and equity grants for certain employees. With respect to benefits, the Company views investments in benefits as an investment in its people.

Beyond delivering health, welfare, retirement benefits, and paid vacation and sick days, Moody\u2019s extends other benefits to support its employees and their families, such as parental leave and educational support. The Company also promotes flexible work arrangements, which support the Company\u2019s efforts to create a work atmosphere in which people feel valued and inspired to give their best. To balance the needs of Moody's employees and business, the Company has implemented a \"PurposeFirst\" framework, which fosters purpose-driven decisions relating to how and where Moody's teams work.  Talent Management, Employee Engagement and Retention Moody\u2019s talent management framework includes learning and development, talent acquisition, performance management, total rewards, succession planning and leadership development. Each of these areas supports the Company\u2019s business strategy and Moody\u2019s culture as a diverse, equitable and inclusive place to work. Moody's views learning and development as an investment in its people that aligns their professional goals and interests with the success of the Company and helps to retain talent over the longer-term. A number of training programs are available, including leadership development, professional skills development, and technical skills. The Company measures employee engagement via multiple channels, including a Business Engagement Survey (BES) for employees to provide anonymous and candid feedback to management. This periodic survey helps Moody's management understand our employees\u2019 level of engagement in critical areas, which include, but are not limited to: company strategy; opportunities for employee development; and work/life balance. Managers are accountable for identifying opportunity areas and taking targeted actions based on survey results. The feedback received through the BES is used as a vital input into making decisions to improve employee experience and retention. Management monitors employee turnover rates as presented in the chart below:    The increase in the Company's voluntary turnover rates in 2022 compared to 2021 is likely due to the overall strength of the global labor market for much of 2022, especially for technology-related jobs. The increase in the Company's involuntary turnover rates in 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily due to the 2022-2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program, which resulted in a reduction in staff, including the relocation of certain job functions.   CLIMATE CHANGE Climate change is a defining issue of our time, and while Moody\u2019s has a limited direct environmental impact, we do nonetheless have an important role to play in demonstrating proactive corporate responsibility and best practices when it comes to climate change mitigation. As such, the Company is taking steps to achieve its commitment to net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2040 by publishing its TCFD report on an annual basis, issuing its decarbonization plan and taking actions to achieve its near and long-term net-zero targets. Moody\u2019s Decarbonization Plan outlines tangible strategies for realizing its climate ambitions, including the procurement of 100% of renewable electricity in the Company\u2019s office spaces and optimizing efficiencies in its operations through its hybrid work program. The costs associated with the implementation of the Decarbonization Plan are not expected to be material.  Furthermore, Moody\u2019s has invested in acquisitions, including RMS, that expand its climate data and analytics capabilities further. To integrate these capabilities into existing offerings, Moody\u2019s is enhancing its technology infrastructure to provide its analysts and researchers with streamlined access to consistent and high-quality climate insights. These enhancements will allow Moody\u2019s to seamlessly integrate climate considerations into its solutions to enable sustainable decision-making. 16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MOODY'S 2022 10-K 16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MOODY'S 2022 10-K 16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MOODY'S 2022 10-K  Table of Contents Table of Contents MOODY\u2019S STRATEGY Moody's is a global integrated risk assessment firm that empowers organizations to make better decisions.

Moody\u2019s expects that these developments will support continued long-term demand for high quality, independent credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services. Moreover, pricing opportunities aligned with customer value creation and advances in information technology present growth opportunities for Moody\u2019s. Moody\u2019s operations are subject to various risks, as more fully described in Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d inherent in conducting business on a global basis.

Therefore, a substantial portion of MIS\u2019s revenue is dependent upon the dollar-equivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets. However, annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers, annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and medium-term note programs, bank deposit ratings, insurance company financial strength ratings, mutual fund ratings, and other areas partially mitigate MIS\u2019s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixed-income markets. MA Prospects for Growth As an integrated risk assessment business, MA helps customers build resilience by providing tools to measure the financial implications of risk and capitalize on related opportunities. Growth in MA is likely to be driven by expansion across customer sectors fostered by a broadening of MA's data, analytics and software solutions to meet an expanded set of customer use cases. MA\u2019s business growth is driven by a number of factors, including: STRONG CUSTOMER RETENTION RATESCROSS-SELLING, UPGRADES & PRICINGCONTINUED SAAS TRANSITION INCREASED DISTRIBUTION CAPACITYNEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT      Moody\u2019s expects that MA products and services that measure and manage risk, provide business insights, and enable compliance with financial regulation, including AML, KYC, and accounting standards, will continue to be in demand from institutions worldwide. To respond to other sources of demand and drive growth, MA is actively investing in new product innovation, enhanced data sets and improved delivery services (e.g., software-as-a-service). These efforts should support broader distribution of MA\u2019s capabilities, deepen relationships with existing customers and drive new customer acquisition.   Competition MIS competes with other CRAs and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research. Many users of MIS\u2019s ratings also have in-house credit research capabilities. There are also some rating markets, based on industry, geography and/or instrument type, in which Moody\u2019s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to its competitors, while in other markets, the reverse is true. MA competes broadly in the financial information and enterprise risk software industries against various diversified competitors. MA\u2019s main competitors within Decision Solutions are providers of software and analytic solutions. In Research & Insights, MA faces competition from providers of economic data, financial research and analysis. MA's main competitors within Data & Information are providers of commercial and financial data.  Regulation MIS, certain of the Company's credit rating affiliates and many of the issuers and/or securities that MIS and the affiliates rate, are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., EU and in other countries (including by state and local authorities). In addition, some of the services offered by MA and its affiliates are subject to regulation in a number of countries. MA also derives a significant amount of its sales from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight and who are required to pass through certain regulatory requirements to key suppliers such as MA. Existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company\u2019s operations, products and the markets in which the Company operates. Additional laws and regulations have been proposed or are being considered. Each of the existing, adopted, proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the Company\u2019s operations, including the issuance of credit ratings, and may negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability and ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for the Company's products and services, in the manner in which the Company's products and services are utilized and in the manner in which the Company operates.

The Reform Act added Section 15E to the Exchange Act and provided the SEC with the authority to establish a registration and oversight program for CRAs registered as NRSROs. The Dodd-Frank Act added additional provisions to Section 15E.  In the EU, the CRA industry is registered and supervised through a pan-EU regulatory framework. ESMA has direct supervisory responsibility for registered CRAs throughout the EU. MIS\u2019s EU CRA subsidiaries are registered and are subject to CRA regulation in the EU and periodic inspection by ESMA. From time to time, ESMA publishes interpretive guidance, or thematic reports regarding various aspects of the CRA regulation and, annually, sets out its work program for the forthcoming year. The Commission is moving forward with their sustainable finance strategy which was released in July 2021. This includes further assessments in respect of both CRAs and sustainability ratings and research, which might lead to legislative action.  On December 31, 2020, the MIS U.K. registered CRA ceased to be registered with and regulated by ESMA and became subject to regulation by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Regulatory arrangements also came into effect in both the U.K. and the EU to allow credit ratings to be available for regulatory use in both the EU and the U.K. MIS has put arrangements in place to endorse its U.K. credit ratings into the EU and its EU credit ratings into the U.K. The FCA has recently stated that it intends to launch a review of competition in the market for credit rating data feeds during the first quarter of 2023. The U.K. Government is also considering bringing ESG data and ratings firms within the scope of FCA authorization and regulation.
