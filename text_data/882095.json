Revenue Share and Other Revenues We also generate revenues from other activities, including revenue share from combination products, royalties for outbound licenses of our intellectual property and other payments received from our collaborations with third-party partners. For example, pursuant to our collaboration with Janssen, we receive revenue share from cobicistat, FTC and TAF that are components of Symtuza (darunavir/cobicistat/FTC/TAF), a fixed-dose combination product commercialized by Janssen. We include our revenue share from Symtuza in our Product sales. For a description of our collaborations with Janssen and other partners, see Note 10. Collaborations and Other Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 4 4 4    Commercialization and Distribution We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in more than 35 countries. Our products are marketed through our commercial teams and/or in conjunction with third-party distributors and corporate partners. Our commercial teams promote our products through direct field contact with physicians, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare providers. We generally grant our third-party distributors the exclusive right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. Most of our agreements with these distributors provide for collaborative efforts between the distributor and Gilead in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the product in the specified territory. We sell and distribute most of our products in the U.S. exclusively through the wholesale channel. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, approximately 89% of our product sales in the U.S. and approximately 63% of our total worldwide revenues were from three large wholesalers: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. We sell and distribute our products in Europe and countries outside the U.S. where the product is approved, either through our commercial teams, third-party distributors or corporate partners. Competition We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other commercially available products based primarily on efficacy, safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease of use, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, distribution and marketing. We also face significant competition as third parties pursue the development of products and technologies that may be competitive with our existing products or research programs. These third parties include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialized pharmaceutical firms acting either independently or together with other such companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection or may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs. In addition, as our products mature, pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers often result in a reduction of the net product prices. Further, as new branded or generic products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected.  Research and Development Our research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) mission is to discover and develop transformational therapies in areas of high unmet medical need. Our product development efforts are focused primarily in viral diseases, oncology and inflammatory diseases. Our team of research scientists is engaged in the discovery and development of new molecules and technologies that we hope will lead to the approval of innovative medicines and therapies that will transform care for people around the world. We intend to continue committing significant resources to internal R&D opportunities and external business development activity to drive innovation and growth of our business.  The development of product candidates and investigational therapies in our pipeline is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include challenges in clinical trial protocol design, our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable or inadequate trial results to support further development of our product candidates, including failure to meet a trial\u2019s primary endpoint, safety issues arising from our clinical trials, and the need to modify or delay our clinical trials or to perform additional trials. As a result, we may be unable to successfully complete our clinical trials on our anticipated timelines, or at all. Based on trial results, it is possible that FDA and other regulatory authorities do not approve our product candidates, or that any market approvals include significant limitations on the products\u2019 use. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidates if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. Therefore, our product candidates may never be successfully commercialized, and we may be unable to recoup the significant R&D and clinical trial expenses incurred. We expect to expend significant time and resources on our R&D activities without any assurance that we will recoup our investments or that our efforts will be commercially successful. Drug development is inherently risky, and many product candidates and investigational therapies fail during the development process. In 2022, we continued to invest in and advance our R&D pipeline across our therapeutic areas. Below is a summary of our product candidates that are in Phase 3 or registrational Phase 2 clinical trials or pending marketing authorization review by FDA or European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d). 5 5 5    Product Candidates in Viral Diseases Product CandidatesDescriptionRegulatory FilingsBulevirtideA Biologics License Application (\u201cBLA\u201d) has been filed with FDA for bulevirtide for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus (\u201cHDV\u201d) infection.

(4) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2018, Gilead and Mylan Pharmaceuticals reached an agreement to settle the patent litigation concerning patents that protect cobicistat in our Stribild and Genvoya products. (5) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. expires in 2032. Patent Protection and Certain Challenges  Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. If we have a properly drafted and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our competitors to use our technology to create competitive products and more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we create. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the U.S. and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology. Patents covering certain of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPI\u201d) of some of our products are held by third parties. We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.  We may obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval. Similar patent term extensions may be available for other products we are developing, but we cannot be certain we will obtain them in some countries. 9 9 9    It is also important that we do not infringe the valid patents of third parties. If we infringe the valid patents of third parties, our reputation may be harmed and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages, we may be prevented from commercializing products or we may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. For example, we are aware of patents and patent applications owned by other parties that such parties may claim to cover the use of our products and research activities. Because patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing, we may not know if our competitors have filed applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our products. In addition, if competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in litigation, post-grant proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other proceedings to determine the right to a patent or validity of any patent granted. Such litigation and proceedings are unpredictable and expensive, and could divert management attention from other operations, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, we may be adversely impacted.  Patents relating to pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products, compounds and processes such as those that cover our existing compounds, products and processes and those that we will likely file in the future, do not always provide complete or adequate protection. Filing patent applications is a fact-intensive and complex process. We may file patent applications that ultimately do not result in patents or have patents that do not provide adequate protection for the related product. Future litigation or other proceedings regarding the enforcement or validity of our existing patents or any future patents could result in the invalidation of our patents or substantially reduce their protection. From time to time, certain individuals or entities may challenge our patents. Our pending patent applications and the patent applications filed by our collaborative partners may not be able to prevent third parties from developing compounds or products that are closely related to those which we have developed or are developing. In addition, certain countries do not provide effective enforcement of our patents, and third-party manufacturers may be able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. We may face criticism as a result of our legitimate use of the patent systems to protect our investments in new and useful innovations in medicine. Further, incentives and exclusivities relating to our products and product candidates may change in the future. We are aware that several countries are considering changes to support sharing how to make and use new inventions that could impact the current patent systems and protections for innovation. Any such changes could also impact the voluntary licensing patent programs that we establish for our products to support access to medicines. For a description of our significant pending legal proceedings, see Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See also Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u201cOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and defend our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally, and to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.\u201d Trade Secrets We also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. For example, a great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise, which is a key component of our liposomal technology, is not covered by patents but is instead protected as a trade secret. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property. We cannot be certain that these parties will comply with these confidentiality agreements, that we have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets, internal know-how or technological innovation will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Under some of our R&D agreements, inventions become jointly owned by us and our corporate partners and in other cases become the exclusive property of one party. In certain circumstances, it can be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention and disputes could arise regarding those inventions. If our trade secrets or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitors, or if we enter into disputes over ownership of inventions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 10 10 10    Manufacturing and Raw Materials Our products are manufactured either at our own facilities or by third-party contract manufacturers. We depend on third parties to perform manufacturing activities for the majority of our API and drug products. For most of our products, including our HIV and HCV products, we use multiple third-party contract manufacturers so that we have primary and back-up suppliers and manufacturing sites. For our cell therapy products, we have established clinical and commercial manufacturing facilities for cell processing activities. For our future products, we continue to develop additional manufacturing capabilities and establish additional third-party suppliers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any product that is approved for commercial sale. Our Manufacturing Facilities  We own or lease manufacturing facilities to manufacture and distribute certain products and API for clinical and/or commercial uses. As of the end of 2022, these facilities include: \u2022Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research, analytical method development and formulation and device development activities, and manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials. \u2022San Dimas and La Verne, California: We manufacture AmBisome and also package and label the majority of our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and the Pacific Rim. \u2022Oceanside, California: We utilize the facility for commercial retroviral vector manufacturing and clinical manufacturing and process development of our biologics candidates. \u2022El Segundo, California: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products. \u2022Frederick, Maryland: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products. \u2022Cork and Dublin, Ireland: We utilize the Cork facility for commercial manufacturing, packaging and labeling of our products. We also perform quality control testing, labeling, packaging and final release of many of our products at the Cork facility, which are distributed to the EU and other international markets through our facility in Dublin.  \u2022Edmonton, Canada: We conduct process chemistry research and scale-up activities for our clinical development candidates, manufacture API for both investigational and commercial products and conduct chemical development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes. \u2022Hoofddorp, Netherlands: We utilize the facility for commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products. Third-Party Manufacturers We believe the technology we use to manufacture our products is proprietary. For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of this technology to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We have agreements with these third-party manufacturers that are intended to restrict them from using or revealing this technology, but we cannot be certain that these third-party manufacturers will comply with these restrictions.  For more information about our third-party manufacturers, see Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u201cWe may face manufacturing difficulties, delays or interruptions, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners.\u201d Regulation of Manufacturing Process The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they observe are not complying with regulations. We, our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cGMP\u201d), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by FDA and EMA. Similar regulations are in effect in other jurisdictions. Our manufacturing operations are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies.  For our cell therapy products, we are required by FDA to comply with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program, which includes educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the therapy procedures and the potential side effect profile of our therapy, such as the potential adverse side effects related to cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities. Additionally, we are required to maintain a complex chain of identity and custody with respect to patient material as such material moves to the manufacturing facilities, through the manufacturing process, and back to the patient. 11 11 11    Access to Raw Materials  We need access to certain raw materials to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our products. These raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, purchased worldwide and normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. We attempt to manage the risks associated with our supply chain by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. For more information, see Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u201cWe may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.\u201d Human Capital Gilead\u2019s success depends on the work of its dedicated employees who embrace a shared sense of purpose and a culture of excellence. Our human capital objective is to make Gilead an employer of choice for the best talent in our industry. Gilead\u2019s key priorities for human capital management include inclusion and diversity, health and safety, total rewards, employee development and engagement. The Compensation and Talent Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our overall human capital management.  Inclusion & Diversity Inclusion is a Gilead core value, and we believe building an inclusive and diverse workforce is critical to enabling Gilead\u2019s mission. Our Global Inclusion and Diversity Council is responsible for governance of these matters, tracking progress on our goals and promoting a culture of inclusion. The Global Inclusion and Diversity Council is chaired by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and includes members of our leadership team. In 2020, we introduced our Advancing Black Leadership Strategy, a multi-year initiative that outlines our commitments to create internal and external pipelines for diverse talent and to build awareness, capabilities and accountability among our people managers. As part of this strategy, we set clear targets for representation within our overall workforce and executive populations, including goals to increase the percentage of female, Black and Hispanic employees with well-defined annual targets through 2025. Gilead also implemented multiple programs to train managers on inclusion and diversity topics, and created strategies and initiatives focused on attracting, developing and retaining diverse talent and driving an inclusive culture in our workplace, which organizational leaders were required to regularly review starting in 2021. In addition, our employee resource groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) support diverse employees and aim to raise awareness of different cultures within the workplace, cultivate diversity as a business strength and support Gilead\u2019s talent acquisition strategy to source, attract and recruit diverse candidates. Executive sponsors and leaders of our ERGs contribute to the advancement of our inclusion and diversity commitments through service on our Global Inclusion and Diversity Council. We believe Gilead\u2019s inclusive and diverse workforce is the foundation for innovation and productivity. Gilead\u2019s commitment to equal employment opportunity furthers its efforts to cultivate and celebrate an equitable culture of belonging. As of December\u00a031, 2022, Gilead had approximately 17,000 employees, and Gilead\u2019s global workforce was approximately 53% female. Additionally, women represented 36% of Gilead\u2019s leadership (defined as vice president level and above). In the U.S., based on our employees\u2019 voluntary self-identification, our workforce was 38% White, 37% Asian, 13% Hispanic, 8% Black and 4% Other. Health and Safety Gilead is committed to providing a workplace for its employees that promotes health, safety, wellness and productivity. We have a workplace safety, training and security program together with various compliance protocols to support this commitment. We routinely train and educate our employees on workplace safety and security. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented job site enhancements and risk protocols, including health screenings, COVID-19 testing and vaccine requirements, reconfiguration of work and common spaces to allow for physical distancing, in our effort to support the safe occupancy of our sites. Gilead also maintains a robust contact tracing and notification process for any employee who reports COVID-19 infection.  Total Rewards Gilead\u2019s compensation and benefits programs are designed to help attract, develop and retain the industry\u2019s most talented workforce. Our Total Rewards program (which varies by country) includes competitive base salary and incentive compensation, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) savings plan with a company match that vests immediately, health and welfare and other valuable benefits, such as flexible work arrangements, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, fertility, adoption and surrogacy assistance, student loan repayment and tuition assistance, employee assistance programs and global wellbeing reimbursement, among many others. Each year, we reassess our Total Rewards package to confirm whether it offers benefits and incentives that align with our total reward philosophy. 12 12 12    We are a pay-for-performance company and are committed to addressing pay equity. Our employee salaries are informed by market-based ranges and are assessed annually through performance and career development reviews. Our policy is that compensation decisions are made without regard to personal characteristics such as gender, race, color, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, religion, or veteran status. We also conduct an annual pay equity review of employee compensation in an effort to strive to make our pay practices gender- and race-neutral.  Employee Development and Engagement Employee development and engagement maximizes the potential and performance of each member of our workforce and is critical to achieving our business goals. Gilead offers a number of internal and external professional, management and leadership development training programs to help our employees develop technical, cross-functional and leadership skills and tools to grow their careers. In addition, employees can receive reimbursement for tuition expenses incurred while pursuing undergraduate, graduate or certificate courses at an accredited college or university. As we strive to be the employer of choice in our industry, our listening strategy gathers input from our employees to shape our engagement strategies and programs and measure our progress. In addition to ongoing internal and external data collection and benchmarking, we conducted comprehensive reviews of the employee experience in 2021 and again in 2022, including through the use of employee surveys. The results of these surveys play a key role in determining the direction of our culture as well as the company\u2019s broader response to emerging developments. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided meaningful benefits to employees and refined our approach to flexible work arrangements. We believe our flexible work program positions us to be competitive for talent and support employee well-being while also creating the collaborative environment and connections that fuel innovation. Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d)  Investing in corporate responsibility is core to our business strategy and reflects our values of accountability, inclusion, teamwork, excellence and integrity. This is in service to our mission to advance global health by providing innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet need in a way that is socially responsible and environmentally sustainable. Gilead\u2019s ESG programs reflect this commitment to our stakeholders. ESG strategy and performance are overseen by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors, and managed by a Corporate Responsibility Committee comprised of leaders from key departments across our company. The Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for reviewing ESG issues and, as appropriate, integrating them into our overall business strategy and operations. Additional information about this program and ESG highlights are available in Gilead\u2019s 2021 year in review on Gilead\u2019s website at https://www.gilead.com/-/media/files/pdfs/yir-2021-pdfs/2021-gilead-yir_desktop.pdf. Our ESG goals are aspirational and may change. Statements regarding these goals and related initiatives are not guarantees or promises that they will be met. Seasonality of Operations Our worldwide product sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality in end-user demand. However, in the U.S., fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels impact our product sales. We typically observe strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases of our products in the fourth quarter, resulting in inventory draw-down by wholesalers and sub-wholesalers in the subsequent first quarter. Several other factors, including government budgets, annual grant cycles for federal and state funds, adverse changes in economic conditions, increased competition and other buying patterns, also could impact the product sales recorded in a particular quarter. For more information, see Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u201cWe face challenges in accurately forecasting sales because of the difficulties in predicting demand for our products and fluctuations in purchasing patterns or wholesaler inventories.\u201d Government Regulation Our operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the U.S., the EU and other countries, including laws and regulations governing the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming, which has a significant impact on our capital expenditures and results of operations. The regulatory requirements applicable to drug development and approval are subject to change. Any legal and regulatory changes may impact our operations in the future. A country\u2019s regulatory agency, such as FDA in the U.S. and EMA and EC in the EU, as well as the national authorities of the EU member states, must approve a drug before it can be sold in the respective country or countries. The general process for drug approval in the U.S. is summarized below. Many other countries, including countries in the EU (and the EU under a centralized procedure), have similar regulatory structures. 13 13 13    Preclinical Testing Before we can test a drug candidate in humans, we must study the drug in laboratory experiments and in animals to generate data to support the drug candidate\u2019s potential benefits and safety. We submit this data to FDA in an Investigational New Drug (\u201cIND\u201d) application seeking its approval to test the compound in humans. Clinical Trials If FDA accepts the IND, the drug candidate can then be studied in human clinical trials to determine if the drug candidate is safe and effective. These clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years and are very expensive. These three phases, which are subject to considerable regulation, are as follows: \u2022Phase 1. The drug candidate is given to a small number of healthy human control subjects or patients suffering or at risk from the indicated disease, to test for safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution and excretion. \u2022Phase 2. The drug candidate is given to a limited patient population to determine the effect of the drug candidate in treating or preventing the disease, the best dose of the drug candidate, and the possible side effects and safety risks of the drug candidate. It is not uncommon for a drug candidate that appears promising in Phase 1 clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous and extensive Phase 2 clinical trials. \u2022Phase 3. If a drug candidate appears to be effective and have an appropriate safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials are commenced to confirm those results. Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted over a longer term, involve a significantly larger population, are conducted at numerous sites in different geographic regions and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefits of a drug candidate. It is not uncommon for a drug candidate that appears promising in Phase 2 clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous and extensive Phase 3 clinical trials. FDA Approval Process When we believe that the data from our clinical trials show an acceptable benefit-risk profile, we submit the appropriate filing, usually in the form of a New Drug Application, Biologics License Application or supplemental application, with FDA, seeking approval to sell the drug candidate for a particular use. At FDA\u2019s discretion, FDA may hold a public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisors asks additional questions and makes recommendations regarding the drug candidate. This committee makes a recommendation to FDA that is not binding but is generally followed by FDA. If FDA agrees that the drug has met the required level of safety and efficacy for a particular use, it will approve the application and allow us to sell the drug in the U.S. for that use. It is not unusual, however, for FDA to decline to approve an application because it believes that the drug candidate is not safe enough or efficacious enough (i.e., does not have an appropriate benefit-risk profile) or because it does not believe that the data submitted is reliable or conclusive. At any point in this process, the development of a drug candidate can be stopped for a number of reasons, including safety concerns, lack of treatment benefit or manufacturing issues. We cannot be certain that any clinical trials that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future will be completed successfully or within any specified time period. We may choose, or FDA may require us, to delay or suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit. Even after approving a drug, FDA may also require Phase 4 non-registrational studies to explore scientific questions to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of our drug. FDA may also require us to provide additional data or information, improve our manufacturing processes, procedures or facilities or may require extensive surveillance to monitor the safety or benefits of our product candidates if it determines that our filing does not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefits of the drug. In addition, even if FDA approves a drug, it could limit the uses of the drug. FDA can withdraw approvals if it does not believe that we are complying with regulatory standards or if concerns about the safety or efficacy are uncovered or occur after approval. In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each drug, we obtain FDA approval of the manufacturing facilities for any drug we sell, including those of companies who manufacture our drugs for us. All of these facilities are subject to periodic inspections by FDA. FDA must also approve foreign establishments that manufacture products to be sold in the U.S. and these facilities are subject to periodic regulatory inspection. Our manufacturing facilities located in California also must be licensed by the State of California in compliance with local regulatory requirements. Our manufacturing facilities in Canada, Ireland and Netherlands also must obtain local licenses and permits in compliance with local regulatory requirements. 14 14 14    FDA may employ one of several tools to facilitate and expedite the development and review of a drug, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Accelerated Approval designation and Priority Review designation. Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and review of a drug that treats a serious condition and fills an unmet medical need. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of a drug that treats a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates substantial improvement over available therapies. Accelerated Approval of a drug may be granted by FDA where the drug treats a serious condition, fills an unmet medical need and has been studied for safety and efficacy. Priority Review designation means FDA\u2019s goal is to take action on an application within six months of filing. FDA may grant Priority Review designation to a drug that would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of a treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition.  EU Regulatory System and Approval Process In the EU, our products are subject to a variety of EU and EU member state regulations governing clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution. We are required to obtain a marketing authorization in the EU before we can market our medicinal products on the relevant market. The conduct of clinical trials in the EU is governed by, among others, Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and the EU (ICH) Good Clinical Practice rules. These impose legal and regulatory obligations that are similar to those provided in applicable U.S. laws. The conduct of clinical trials in the EU must be approved by the competent authorities of each EU member states in which the clinical trials take place, and a positive opinion must be obtained from the relevant Ethics Committee in the relevant member state. In 2014, the EU legislator adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 to replace Directive 2001/20/EC and to introduce a coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials. This Regulation entered into application in January 2022.  Marketing authorization holders, manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and distributors of medicinal products placed on the market in the EU are required to comply with a number of regulatory requirements including pharmacovigilance, GMP compliance and the requirement to obtain manufacturing, import and/or distribution licenses issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states. Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to the imposition of civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of marketing or manufacturing authorizations. Pricing and Reimbursement Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of third-party payer reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments and medical services in the markets where we sell our products. Government health authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. In the U.S., the EU and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services. A significant portion of our sales of the majority of our products are subject to substantial discounts from their list prices, including rebates we may be required to pay to Medicaid agencies or discounts we may be required to pay to covered entities under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act (\u201c340B\u201d). As a result, the price increases we implement from time to time on certain products may have a limited effect on our net product sales in certain markets. In addition, standard reimbursement structures may not adequately reimburse for innovative therapies. As our products mature, pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers often result in a reduction of the net product prices. Further, as new branded or generic products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected.  For more information, see Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u201cOur existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and other discounts on our products and other pricing pressures.\u201d and \u201cWe face challenges in accurately forecasting sales because of the difficulties in predicting demand for our products and fluctuations in purchasing patterns or wholesaler inventories.\u201d 15 15 15    Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws; Anti-Bribery Laws We are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care \u201cfraud and abuse,\u201d including anti-kickback laws and false claim laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to knowingly and willingly solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by federal and certain state payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. In addition, FDA regulates written and verbal communications about our products. In addition to federal law, states also have consumer protection and false claims laws. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities, our sales, marketing, patient support, medical, clinical and public affairs activities may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. For example, recently there has been enhanced scrutiny by government enforcement authorities of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs and manufacturer donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance, reimbursement support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. Similarly, in Europe, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are subject to strict laws, regulations, industry self\u2011regulation codes of conduct and physicians\u2019 codes of professional conduct, as applicable, including the EU member states anti-corruption laws and the UK Bribery Act 2010. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state controlled, in a manner that is different than local custom.  Despite our training and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from unlawful acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of fraud and abuse laws or anti-bribery laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Violations can also lead to the imposition of a Corporate Integrity Agreement or similar government oversight program, even if we disagree with the government\u2019s perspective that we have violated any rules or guidance. Any similar violations by our competitors could also negatively impact the reputation of our industry and increase governmental and public scrutiny over our business and our products. For more information, see Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \u201cWe are impacted by evolving laws, regulations and legislative or regulatory actions applicable to the health care industry.\u201d Environment We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that require compliance with federal, state, and local regulations for the protection of the environment. The regulatory landscape continues to evolve, and we anticipate additional regulations in the future. Laws and regulations are implemented and under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Our business is not energy intensive. Therefore, we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or other mitigation measure that would materially impact our capital expenditures, operations or competitive position.  Other Information We are subject to the information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d). Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy and information statements and other information with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with SEC. Our website is www.gilead.com. Through a link on the \u201cInvestors\u201d page of our website (under the \u201cFinancials - SEC Filings\u201d section), we make available the following filings free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to SEC: our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; Current Reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
