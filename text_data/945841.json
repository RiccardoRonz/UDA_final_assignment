{"cik": 945841, "item_1A": "Item 1.\u00a0 Business  General  Pool Corporation (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us or our), a member of the S&P 500 Index, is the world\u2019s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States.    Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we operated 420 sales centers in North America, Europe and Australia through our five distribution networks:  \u2022SCP Distributors (SCP); \u2022Superior Pool Products (Superior); \u2022Horizon Distributors (Horizon);  \u2022National Pool Tile (NPT); and  \u2022Sun Wholesale Supply, Inc. (Sun Wholesale).  Our Industry  We believe that the swimming pool industry will continue to grow with the increased penetration of new pools into households with the discretionary income and physical capacity to install a swimming pool.  Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of environmentally sustainable, energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products.  The desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes, lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes future growth opportunities in this area.    Favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry, and we believe these trends will continue to do so over the long term.\u00a0\u00a0These favorable trends include the following:  \u2022long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, where use of the outdoor home environment is more prevalent and extends longer throughout the year; \u2022increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment; \u2022consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels;  \u2022consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time;  \u2022consumers increasing focus on environmentally sustainable, energy-efficient products; and \u2022stay-at-home and remote work trends as homeowners seek to create attractive areas in their backyards as an extension of their home space.  About 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools.\u00a0\u00a0Maintaining a proper sanitization balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies.\u00a0\u00a0We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool\u2019s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products that we supply. \u00a0 We\u00a0believe that consistent growth of the installed base of in-ground swimming pools and the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth.\u00a0\u00a0This characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted consumer discretionary spending, including pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.    1 1 1   The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11\u00a0years (based on Company estimates and information from 2021 P.K. Data, Inc. reports):     The swimming pool remodel, renovation and upgrade market currently accounts for 21% to 23% of consumer spending in the pool industry.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling and upgrading, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools and availability of enhanced feature products such as swimming pool automated controls, variable speed pumps, robotic cleaners and LED pool and hot tub lighting.  Many new homeowners with existing pools transform older pools into a modern backyard oasis through upgraded finishes and updated equipment.  Among other factors like southern migration and housing shortage trends, the timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors including home values, single-family home sales and consumer confidence that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.    New swimming pool construction comprises 17% to 18% of consumer spending in the pool industry.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience.\u00a0\u00a0The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations.\u00a0 The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic, environmental,\u00a0safety or other reasons.  The irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize similar long-term growth rates.  Irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new single-family home construction making them more susceptible to economic variables that drive new home sales.  However, the landscape industry offers similar maintenance-related growth opportunities as the swimming pool industry.  Product offerings such as chemicals and fertilizers, power equipment and related repair and maintenance services offer recurring revenue streams in an industry otherwise closely tied to the housing market.  The irrigation and landscape distribution business serves both residential and commercial markets, with the majority of sales related to the residential market.\u00a0\u00a0Within the United States market, we believe that irrigation accounts for approximately 30% to 35% of total spending in the industry, with the remaining 65% to 70% of spending related to landscape maintenance products, power equipment, hardscapes and specialty outdoor products and accessories.    Economic Environment  Certain trends in the housing market, the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions (as commonly measured by Gross Domestic Product or GDP) affect our industry, particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments, equipment replacements, landscaping projects and outdoor living space renovations.  Consumers typically spend more on new pools, refurbishment and replacement when general economic conditions are strong.  2 2 2    We believe that over the long term, single-family housing turnover and home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction, with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool installations over time.\u00a0\u00a0While most new swimming pools are installed in existing homes, there has also been a strong correlation of new pool construction activity to new home construction activities over time.  We also believe that homeowners\u2019 good economic standing and availability of consumer credit are critical factors enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems.\u00a0\u00a0Similar to other discretionary purchases, replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence, GDP and employment levels.  Contractor labor availability has also become an issue in recent years, limiting our customers\u2019 ability to fully meet consumer construction and renovation demand.    Over the past decade, consumers' investments in their homes, including backyard renovations, have flourished.  Particularly, over the past couple of years, steady increases in home values and lack of affordable new homes have prompted homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments, including their backyards.  Many families have spent more time at home and sought opportunities to create or expand home-based outdoor living and entertainment spaces.  These trends resulted in an increase in new pool construction and greater expenditures for maintenance and remodeling products.  More recent trends, including a lower number of permits issued for new pools, suggest that new construction activities are moderating after significant growth over the past couple of years.   In 2022, we estimate that new pool construction decreased 16% to approximately 98,000 units from 117,000 units in 2021 when new pool construction units had increased 22% over 2020.  We expect that consumers will continue to invest in outdoor living spaces as consumers consider backyards an extension of their home space.  Despite the recent decline in residential construction activities, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the inherent long-term growth opportunities in our industry fueled by favorable population migration trends, strong housing demand dynamics and product developments and technological advancements as consumers focus on more environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient products.      We generally pass industry price increases through our supply chain and may make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in order to obtain favorable pricing.  Historically, annual price inflation averaged 1% to 2% in our industry.  During 2021 and 2022, supply chain interruptions, production shutdowns and weather-related events resulted in increased inflation as higher costs to develop finished products were passed down to consumers.  Our results in 2022 benefited from above-average inflationary product cost increases of approximately 10% compared to 7% to 8% in 2021.  We expect inflationary product cost increases to moderate in 2023, and project that our sales will benefit approximately 4% from inflationary product cost increases.    Business Strategy and Growth Strategy  Our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers, creating exceptional return to our shareholders, while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees.\u00a0\u00a0Our core strategies are as follows:  \u2022to promote the growth of our industry; \u2022to promote the growth of our customers\u2019 businesses; and \u2022to continuously strive to operate more effectively.    We promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership, the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming.\u00a0\u00a0These programs include digital and media advertising, industry-oriented website development such as www.swimmingpool.com\u00ae, www.hottubs.com\u00ae and www.nptpool.com\u00ae, social media platforms and other digital marketing initiatives, including our NPT\u00ae Backyard mobile app.\u00a0\u00a0We use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers.  We promote the growth of our customers\u2019 businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales.\u00a0\u00a0Our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation, personalized websites, brochures, direct mail, marketing campaigns and business development training.\u00a0\u00a0As a customer service, we also provide certain customers assistance with all aspects of their business, including site selection, store layout and design, product merchandising, business management system implementation, comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes.  In addition to these programs, we feature consumer showrooms in over 100 of our sales centers and host our annual Retail Summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry, which we successfully held in January 2023 after a two year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We also act as a day-to-day resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers\u2019 unique needs.    3 3 3   In addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth, we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations, which we define as capacity creation.  We create capacity with business to business development tools and execution to ensure best-in-class service and value creation for our customers and suppliers.  In particular, our Pool360 and Horizon 24/7 internet and mobile platforms help our customers be more productive by allowing them to digitally receive pricing and product availability information, and enter orders, while leveraging our customer service staff resources, particularly during peak business periods.  These tools not only offer real-time integration into our enterprise resource planning system, creating efficiencies in our business processes as well, but they also provide our customers graphical catalog presentation in the same platform.  We recently re-launched our Pool360 platform with enhanced features, including a new user-friendly design, improved speed and responsiveness, access to real-time inventory availability and an easier way for our customers to quickly and accurately find our products.  Our BlueStreak mobile ordering platform enables our sales associates to process orders faster, often eliminating the need for customers to get out of their vehicles.  We are also actively making improvements to our sales centers and warehouses through a focus on speed at the counter, improved showroom layouts, sales center merchandising, bin replenishment and velocity slotting.  Velocity slotting uses technology to identify fast moving, high velocity items, which are then color-coded and placed in an easily accessible location to create efficiencies for both our employees and customers.    We believe that ongoing investments in digital transformation and technology help us provide best-in-class service to our customers by improving the customer experience, enhancing our existing customer relationships and expanding our customer base.  To that end, a part of our growth strategy includes investing in technology that allows us to better serve our customers and using this information to make better data-driven decisions for our business.   We have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings, acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers depending on our market presence and capacity.  For additional information regarding our new sales center openings, acquisitions and closures/consolidations, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and Item 8, Note\u00a02 of \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d included in this Form\u00a010-K.  We plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories.  We believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically.  Going forward, we expect to continue to realize sales growth through market share gains and continued expansion of our product offerings with a focus on our Pool Corporation-branded products and exclusive brand offerings.    Customers and Products  We serve roughly 125,000 customers.  No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales in 2022.  Most of our customers are small, family-owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources.  Most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors and specialty retailers employing no more than ten employees (in many cases, working alone or with a limited crew).\u00a0 These customers also buy from other distributors, mass merchants, home stores and certain specialty and internet retailers.  We provide extended payment terms to qualified customers for sales under pre-season early buy programs, which typically occur during the fourth and first quarters.  The extended terms usually require payments in equal installments during the second quarter of each year.  See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\u201d for additional information.  We sell our products primarily to the following types of customers:  \u2022swimming pool remodelers and builders; \u2022specialty retailers that sell swimming pool supplies, including independently owned and operated Pinch A Penny franchise stores; \u2022swimming pool repair and service businesses; \u2022irrigation construction and landscape maintenance contractors; and \u2022commercial pool operators and pool contractors who build, remodel or service large commercial installations such as hotels, universities and community recreational facilities.  We conduct our operations through 420 sales centers in North America, Europe and Australia.  Our primary markets, with the highest concentration of swimming pools, are California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, collectively representing approximately 53% of our 2022 net sales.\u00a0\u00a0In 2022, we generated approximately 96% of our sales in North America (including Canada and Mexico), 4% in Europe and less than 1% in Australia.  While we continue to expand both domestically and internationally, we  4 4 4   expect this geographic mix to be similar over the next few years.  References to product line and product category data throughout this Form 10-K generally reflect data related to the North American swimming pool market, as it is more readily available for analysis and represents the largest component of our operations.  Our goal is to be a trusted resource for both industry professionals and consumers in the outdoor living industry.  We use local sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers\u2019 businesses.  Our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer training programs and promotional activities, creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise.\u00a0\u00a0Our local sales personnel work from our sales centers.  They are a trusted resource for our customers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers\u2019 specific needs.  Our sales center personnel help educate our customers on a variety of topics including innovative products and solutions that can elevate their businesses.  We offer our customers more than 200,000 manufacturer and Pool Corporation-branded products.\u00a0\u00a0We believe that our selection of pool equipment, supplies, chemicals, replacement parts, irrigation and related products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry.  We sell the following types of products: \u00a0 \u2022maintenance products, such as chemicals, supplies and pool accessories; \u2022repair and replacement parts for pool equipment, such as cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps and lights; \u2022building materials, such as concrete, plumbing and electrical components, both functional and decorative pool surfaces, decking materials, tile, hardscapes and natural stone, used for pool installations and remodeling;  \u2022pool equipment and components for new pool construction and the remodeling and replacement of existing pools; \u2022irrigation and related products, including irrigation system components and professional turf care equipment and supplies;  \u2022commercial pool products, including American Society of Material Engineers heaters, safety equipment, commercial decking equipment and commercial pumps and filters;  \u2022fiberglass pools and hot tubs and packaged pool kits including walls, liners, braces and coping for in-ground and above-ground pools; and  \u2022other pool construction and recreational products, which consist of a number of product categories and include discretionary recreational and related outdoor living products, such as grills and components for outdoor kitchens.  We currently have over 600 product lines and approximately\u00a050\u00a0product categories.  Based\u00a0on our 2022 product classifications, sales for our pool and hot tub chemicals product category represented approximately 13% of total net sales for 2022, 9% of total net sales in 2021 and 10% of total net sales in 2020.  The increase in pool and hot tub chemicals as a percentage of our total net sales from 2021 to 2022 was driven by inflation, improved supply over last year, strong demand for non-discretionary maintenance products, and our December 2021 acquisition of Porpoise Pool & Patio, Inc., who operates a chemical packaging plant.  No other product categories accounted for 10% or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years.  We continue to identify new related product categories, and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets.\u00a0\u00a0We then evaluate the performance in these markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best long-term growth potential.  We expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products, increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a company-wide basis.    New product technology provides opportunities not only for improved energy-efficiency but also new enticements for leisure activities.  Major equipment manufacturers have developed and will continue to develop more retrofit kits that allow homeowners to interact with their pools or hot tubs through their smartphones.  Robotic cleaners offer consumers a more efficient option for maintaining their swimming pools.  Regulation passed by the U.S. Department of Energy, which became effective in July 2021, mandated all new pumps sold for swimming pools must meet certain compliance regulations.  We see each of these developments as significant growth opportunities.  We offer a growing selection of energy-efficient and environmentally preferred products, which supports sustainability and helps pool owners save energy, water, time and money.  Our environmentally-friendly technology products include variable speed pumps, LED pool and hot tub lights and high-efficiency heat pumps.  Our Horizon sales centers offer organic fertilizers, organic pesticides, and irrigation and drainage products that reduce water usage and soil erosion, allowing our customers and homeowners to have less of an impact on freshwater reserves.    Over the last several years, we have increased our product offerings and service abilities related to commercial swimming pools.  We consider the commercial market to be a key growth opportunity as we focus more attention on providing products to customers who operate and service large commercial installations such as hotels, condominiums, apartment complexes, universities and community recreational facilities.  We continue to leverage our existing networks and relationships to grow this  5 5 5   market.  Sales to commercial customers declined in 2020 due to COVID-19 related closures and the decline in both business and leisure travel.  In 2021, commercial sales accelerated as business and leisure travel increased and public facilities reopened.  This growth was sustained throughout 2022.  In 2022, the sale of maintenance and minor repair products (non-discretionary) accounted for approximately 60% of our sales and gross profits, while approximately 40% of our sales and gross profits were derived from the remodel, renovation, upgrade, construction and installation (equipment, materials, plumbing, electrical, etc.) of swimming pools (partially discretionary).  These components may vary from year to year.    Over the last several years, we have experienced product and customer mix changes, including a shift in consumer spending to some higher value, lower margin products such as variable speed pumps and high efficiency heaters.  We expect continued demand for these products, but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives, including growth in our higher margin private label and exclusive products (PLEX) and our expansion of building materials product offerings, have helped offset these gross margin declines.   Operating Strategy  We distribute swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products domestically through our SCP and Superior networks and internationally through our SCP network.  We adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the U.S. swimming pool market primarily to offer our customers a choice of distinctive product selections, locations and service personnel.  We distribute irrigation, landscape maintenance and related products through our Horizon network.    Swimming pool tile, decking materials and interior pool surfacing products are distributed through our NPT network, as well as through SCP and Superior networks.  Our NPT network primarily serves the swimming pool market but does provide some overlap with the irrigation and landscape industries as we offer our market-leading brand of pool tile, composite pool finish products and hardscapes.  As more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment, we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand by leveraging our existing pool and irrigation and landscape customer base.  We feel the development of our NPT network is a natural extension of our distribution model.  In addition to our 19 standalone NPT sales centers, we currently have over 100 SCP and Superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where landscape and swimming pool contractors, as well as homeowners, can view and select pool components including pool tile, decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades, and serve as stocking locations for our NPT branded products.  We also offer virtual tools for homeowners to select and design their pool and outdoor environments, working with their chosen contractors to install these products.  Our NPT\u00ae Backyard mobile app and www.nptpool.com\u00ae allow our customers to virtually design, customize and view a pool in their own backyard within seconds.  We believe our showrooms, local stocking of products and virtual support provide us with a competitive advantage in these categories.  Given the more discretionary nature of these products, this business is more sensitive to external market factors compared to our business overall.   In December 2021, we acquired Sun Wholesale Supply, Inc., which distributes swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products, primarily servicing independently owned and operated Pinch A Penny, Inc. franchise locations.  Going forward, we expect to expand Pinch A Penny franchise operations through additional locations of Pinch A Penny franchised stores.  Sun Wholesale Supply, Inc. also owns and operates a specialty chemical packaging operation providing pool chemical products to the Pinch A Penny franchised store network and a portion of the chemical products sold through our SCP and Superior sales centers.    We evaluate our sales centers based on their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures.\u00a0\u00a0Our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services, such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs, services from our real estate support function to find appropriate locations for our sales centers, human resources support, information systems support, support from our logistics and fleet teams, accounting and financial analysis support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals.\u00a0\u00a0We believe our incentive programs and feedback tools, along with the competitive nature of our sales center network, stimulate and enhance employee performance.  Distribution  Our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations, typically in industrial, commercial or mixed-use zones.\u00a0\u00a0Customers may pick up products at any sales center location, or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third-party carriers.  For additional information on our sales centers, see Item 2, \u201cProperties,\u201d of this Form 10-K. 6 6 6    Our sales centers maintain well-stocked inventories to meet our customers\u2019 immediate needs.\u00a0\u00a0We utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving, inventory control, picking, packing and shipping functions.  For additional information regarding our inventory management, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Inventory Obsolescence,\u201d of this Form 10-K.    We also operate four centralized shipping locations (CSLs) in the United States that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or, in some cases, directly to customers.\u00a0\u00a0Our CSLs are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool, irrigation and landscape products and related construction products.\u00a0\u00a0  Purchasing and Suppliers  We enjoy good relationships with our suppliers, who generally offer competitive pricing, return policies and promotional allowances.\u00a0\u00a0It is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to manage their shipments by offering seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as Pool Corporation, which are referred to as early buy purchases.\u00a0\u00a0These early buy purchases typically allow us to place orders in the fall at a modest discount, take delivery of product during the off-season months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer.  Due to vendor backlogs resulting in product availability constraints, these early buy opportunities were generally not available in 2021 or 2020, but were re-established in 2022.  Our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors offering the best overall terms and service to optimize profitability and shareholder return.\u00a0\u00a0We also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments.\u00a0\u00a0These practices, together with a more comprehensive service offering, have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments.  See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Vendor Programs,\u201d for additional information.  We regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to ensure competitive cost, service and quality standards.\u00a0\u00a0Our largest suppliers include Pentair plc, Hayward Pool Products, Inc. and Zodiac Pool Systems,\u00a0Inc., which accounted for approximately 18%, 11% and 9%, respectively, of the cost of products we sold in\u00a02022.  Competition  We are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products (based on industry knowledge and available data) and one of the only national wholesale distributors focused on the swimming pool industry in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0We are also one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0We face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from three national wholesale distributors of irrigation and landscape supplies.\u00a0\u00a0We also face competition, both directly and indirectly, from mass market retailers (both store-based and internet) and large pool supply retailers who primarily buy directly from manufacturers.   Some geographic markets we serve, particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, have a greater concentration of competition than others.\u00a0\u00a0Barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low.\u00a0 We believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply distribution are:  \u2022the breadth and availability of products offered; \u2022the quality and level of customer service, including ease of ordering and speed of product delivery; \u2022the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs; \u2022consistency and stability of business relationships with customers and suppliers; \u2022competitive product pricing; and \u2022geographic proximity to the customer.  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)  Environmental  We are committed to sustainable business practices, which includes offering eco-friendly products to our customers, closely monitoring our sourcing activities, and being good stewards within the communities we serve.  Currently, we are taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint and to improve product choices that allow pool and homeowners to reduce their environmental impact.  Further, we are installing more energy-efficient systems throughout our sales center network.  We are continually striving to ensure success in our business while protecting resources for future generations.  Our sustainability goals include the  7 7 7   reduction of greenhouse gases and other harmful air emissions, water conservation, energy conservation and carbon footprint minimization.  We continuously endeavor to improve the ways in which we handle, distribute, transport and dispose of all products, particularly the chemicals and fertilizers that we sell.    Social - Human Capital Management   We employed approximately 6,000 people at December\u00a031, 2022.  Given the seasonal nature of our business, our peak employment period is the summer season and, depending on expected sales levels, we add 100 to 200 employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand.  Approximately 90% of our employees are located in the U.S.  We believe that we have good relations with our employees.  None of our employees are currently covered under any collective bargaining agreements.  Our goal is to be an Employer of Choice through focusing on the engagement, development, retention, and health and well\u2011being of our employees.  We believe that our success is a direct result of the contributions and commitment of our employees.  We provide competitive pay and benefits, training and continuing education, and professional development and promotional opportunities to engage and reward our team.  We have established a set of standard operating procedures to optimize our human capital management function, including hiring and human resource policies, training practices and operational instructions.  We focus on the following factors in implementing and developing our human capital strategy:  \u2022employee health, safety and wellness; \u2022diversity, equity and inclusion;  \u2022employee growth and development; and \u2022employee compensation and benefits.  Employee Health, Safety and Wellness  Our commitment to the health, safety and wellness of our employees ranks at the top of our core fundamental values.  Our ultimate goal is to send every employee home each night in the same condition in which they came to work that morning.  We aim to achieve zero serious injuries through continued investment in, and focus on, our core safety programs and injury-reduction initiatives.  This effort begins immediately with new employees and is reinforced each day through a focus on training, safety awareness, risk identification and other essential safety protocols.  We closely monitor overall workers\u2019 compensation and auto claims, OSHA recordable incidents, Department of Transportation compliance and other internally established safety prevention elements in an effort to make every workday safe.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)  We are committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that represents the communities in which we work and live.  We believe that diversity drives innovation and delivers the best solutions to complex problems, and our culture is one where differences are welcomed, valued and respected.    We are committed to expanding the diversity of our workforce through the hiring, retention and advancement of underrepresented populations.  To achieve this, our approach to DEI is as follows:   \u2022Diversity: Recruit, develop and retain a diverse workforce and provide developmental opportunities for career advancement for all employees;  \u2022Equity: Review current policies, practices and procedures to remove possible impediments to equal employment opportunity for prospective candidates and employees; and \u2022Inclusion: Communicate that we, as an Employer of Choice, are committed to DEI with action-oriented programs that produce results and employee engagement.  Our DEI efforts are focused on expanding content in core employee development programs and improving our ability to recruit and hire first-class diverse talent.  To create connection and community, we've established a Women\u2019s Interactive Network (WIN) and diversity mentoring program to cultivate the growth and development of our female and diverse employees.  In addition to our recent initiatives, we continue to support our existing employees with training and development, which includes content aimed at creating and sustaining a more inclusive environment.    Employee Growth and Development   We strive to be an Employer of Choice by investing in our employees.  Our goal is to attract, develop and retain a talented team of diverse people inspired by our mission to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers and create exceptional  8 8 8   return to our shareholders, while providing exceptional opportunities for our employees.  Our success depends on our employees understanding how their work contributes to the company\u2019s overall strategy.    When our employees succeed, the company succeeds.  To help our employees achieve success in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and career development opportunities.  These include annual performance assessments, promotion and advancement opportunities, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies.  We also provide managerial training to emerging leaders, mid-level managers and departmental leaders.  This coursework covers topics such as talent review, development of underperforming employees, handling employee misconduct and coaching and success workshops.    Our employees are also involved in a multitude of volunteer efforts that positively impact our communities through support of charitable organizations.  Recently, we have donated over $2 million through our partnerships with YMCAs across the country to provide free water safety lessons and lifeguard training in underserved communities.  Our donations have funded more than 20,000 safety around water swimming lessons and lifeguard training scholarships from coast to coast.  Our local employees and partners donated their time and energy to make these events a success.  We also provide an entry level program to prepare Manager Trainees (MITs) for sales and operations management opportunities.  Our MITs are hosted at either our state-of-the-art EDGEucation Center or in a virtual classroom.  They gain valuable experience during their training program through field-based interaction with customers and operating management.  Our program includes lectures by subject matter experts, hands-on projects and role play to provide MITs with practical industry knowledge, leadership skills and the tools necessary to succeed within our organization.  Employee Compensation and Benefits  We strive to provide market-competitive compensation, benefits and services to our employees.  Our performance-based compensation philosophy rewards each employee\u2019s individual contributions regardless of gender, race or ethnicity.  Our total compensation package includes cash compensation (base salary and incentive or bonus payments), company contributions toward additional benefits (such as health and disability plans), retirement plans with a company match and paid time off.  We also offer the opportunity to become a shareholder through equity grants for management and our employee stock purchase plan.  Our employees can take advantage of a range of benefits, including healthcare and wellness programs, tuition reimbursement for eligible employees and multi-year scholarships to their dependents, and financial wellness programs to help provide education and tools to assist in improving, maintaining and capitalizing on our employees\u2019 financial future.  We closely monitor employee turnover and conduct exit interviews to gain relevant information and adapt our engagement and retention strategy as appropriate.  Governance  Our employees, managers and officers conduct our business under the direction of our CEO and the oversight of our Board of Directors (our Board) to enhance our long-term value for our stockholders.  The core responsibility of our Board is to exercise its fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of our company and our stockholders.  In exercising this obligation, our Board and committees perform a number of specific functions, including risk assessment, review and oversight.  While management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk, our Board is responsible for oversight of our risk management programs, ensuring that an appropriate culture of risk management exists within the company, and assisting management in addressing specific risks, such as strategic risks, financial risks, cybersecurity risks, regulatory risks and operational risks.  Seasonality and Weather  Our business is seasonal.  In general, sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters, which represent the peak months of swimming pool use, pool and irrigation installation and remodeling and repair activities.  Sales are lower during the first and fourth quarters.  In 2022, we generated approximately 59% of our net sales and 67% of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year.  We typically experience a build-up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season.\u00a0 Excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases, our peak borrowing usually occurs during the late spring and summer, primarily because extended terms offered by certain of our suppliers are typically payable during the second quarter of each year, while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in June, July and August.  9 9 9   We expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers.\u00a0\u00a0Based on our peak summer selling season, we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers, when warranted, either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends.  Weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business.  The table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions.

Government Regulations  Our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international, federal, state and local environmental and health and safety requirements, including regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Fire Protection Agency and the International Maritime Organization.  Most of these requirements govern the packaging, labeling, handling, transportation, storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers.  We store certain types of chemicals and/or fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes.  In addition, we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and various state pesticide laws.  These\u00a0laws primarily relate to labeling, annual registration and licensing.  Intellectual Property  We maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks and patents, primarily for our Pool Corporation and affiliate branded products that are important to our current and future business operations.  We also own rights to numerous internet domain names.  10 10 10   Geographic Areas  The table below presents net sales by geographic region, with international sales translated into U.S. dollars at prevailing exchange rates, for the past three fiscal years (in thousands): \u00a0Year Ended December 31,\u00a0202220212020United States$5,674,909\u00a0$4,749,459\u00a0$3,579,990\u00a0International504,818\u00a0546,125\u00a0356,633\u00a0\u00a0$6,179,727\u00a0$5,295,584\u00a0$3,936,623\u00a0  The table below presents net property and equipment by geographic region, with international property and equipment balances translated into U.S. dollars at prevailing exchange rates, for the past three fiscal year ends (in thousands): \u00a0December 31,\u00a0202220212020United States$185,117\u00a0$171,408\u00a0$100,857\u00a0International8,592\u00a07,600\u00a07,384\u00a0\u00a0$193,709\u00a0$179,008\u00a0$108,241\u00a0  Website Access and Available Information  Our website is www.poolcorp.com.
