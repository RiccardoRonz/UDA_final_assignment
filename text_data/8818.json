Our website address provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not intended to function as a hyperlink and the information on our website is not, nor should it be considered, part of this report or incorporated by reference into this report.  Business Overview and Reportable Segments We are a global materials science and digital identification solutions company that provides branding and information labeling solutions, including pressure-sensitive materials, radio-frequency identification (\"RFID\") inlays and tags, and a variety of converted products and solutions. We design and manufacture a wide range of labeling and functional materials that enhance branded packaging, carry or display information that connects the physical and the digital, and improve customers\u2019 product performance. We serve an array of industries worldwide, including home and personal care, apparel, e-commerce, logistics, food and grocery, pharmaceuticals and automotive.  In the fourth quarter of 2022, we changed our operating structure to align with our overall business strategy, and our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker, requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews to allocate resources and assess performance. As a result, our fiscal year 2022 results are reported based on our new reportable segments described below and in Note 15, \"Segment Information.\" We have recast prior periods to reflect our new operating structure. Our reportable segments for fiscal year 2022 were:  \u2022Materials Group; and  \u2022Solutions Group  These segment changes resulted in a new segment, Materials Group, consisting of our former Label and Graphic Materials segment and Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Additionally, our formerly named Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment is referred to as Solutions Group. In 2022, our Materials Group and Solutions Group reportable segments made up approximately 72% and 28%, respectively, of our total net sales.  In 2022, international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business, representing approximately 72% of our net sales. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we operated nearly 200 manufacturing and distribution facilities in over 50 countries.  Materials Group Our Materials Group business is a leading solutions provider to the pressure-sensitive label and graphics industries worldwide. Our label materials enhance shelf appeal for brands, inform shoppers and improve operational supply chain efficiency. Our graphics solutions include a comprehensive portfolio of highly engineered materials that range from vehicle wraps to architectural products. The Materials Group plays a key role in advancing our fast-growing intelligent labels platform, providing the materials science capabilities and process engineering expertise that are essential to developing and manufacturing intelligent labels at scale. Materials Group manufactures and sells Fasson\u00ae-, JAC\u00ae-, and Avery Dennison\u00ae-brand pressure-sensitive label materials and performance tapes products, Avery Dennison\u00ae- and Mactac\u00ae-brand graphics, and Avery Dennison\u00ae-brand reflective products. Materials Group\u2019s business tends not to be seasonal, except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products.  Pressure-sensitive materials consist primarily of papers, plastic films, metal foils and fabrics, which are coated with internally-developed and purchased adhesives, and then laminated with specially-coated backing papers and films. They are then sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings in a wide range of face materials, sizes, thicknesses and adhesive properties.  A pressure-sensitive, or self-adhesive, material is one that adheres to a surface by press-on contact. It generally consists of four layers: a face material, which may be paper, metal foil, plastic film or fabric; an adhesive, which may be permanent or removable; a release coating; and a backing material to protect the adhesive from premature contact with other surfaces that can also serve as a carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels. When the products are to be used, the release coating and protective backing are removed, exposing the adhesive so that the label or other face material  2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents may be pressed or rolled into place. Because they are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation, self-adhesive materials can provide cost savings compared to other materials that require heat- or moisture-activated adhesives, while also offering aesthetic and other advantages over alternative technologies.  Label materials are sold worldwide to label converters for labeling, decorating and specialty applications in the home and personal care, beer and beverage, durables, pharmaceutical, wine and spirits, and food market segments. When used in package decoration applications, the visual appeal of self-adhesive materials can help increase sales of the products on which the materials are applied. Self-adhesive materials are also used to convey variable information, such as bar codes for mailing or weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods. Self-adhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials, which can be made into labels of varying sizes and shapes.  Our graphics and reflective products include a variety of films and other products that are sold to the architectural, commercial sign, digital printing and other related market segments. We also sell durable cast and reflective films to the construction, automotive and fleet transportation market segments and reflective films for traffic and safety applications. We provide sign shops, commercial printers and designers a broad range of pressure-sensitive materials that allow them to create impactful and informative brand and decorative graphics. We offer a wide array of pressure-sensitive vinyl and specialty materials designed for digital imaging, screen printing and sign cutting applications.  Our performance tapes products include a variety of Fasson\u00ae-brand and Avery Dennison\u00ae-brand tapes and other pressure-sensitive adhesive-based materials and converted products, mechanical fasteners and performance polymers. Our pressure-sensitive adhesive-based materials are available in roll form and in a wide range of face materials, sizes, thicknesses and adhesive properties. These materials and converted products are used in non-mechanical fastening, bonding and sealing systems for various automotive, electronics, building and construction, general industrial, personal care, and medical applications.  Also, our performance tapes products include Yongle\u00ae-brand tapes for wire harnessing and cable wrapping in automotive, electrical and general industrial applications. The mechanical fasteners are primarily precision-extruded and injection-molded plastic devices used in various automotive, general industrial and retail applications.  Our larger competitors in label materials include UPM Raflatac, a subsidiary of UPM Corporation; Lintec Corporation; Ritrama SpA, a subsidiary of the Fedrigoni Group; Flexcon Corporation, Inc.; and various regional and local companies.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses  The loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole, nor to our operating segments individually. Our principal trademarks are Avery Dennison, our logo, and Fasson. We believe these trademarks are strong in the market segments in which we operate.  Human Capital Resources  Our Global Workforce  With approximately 72% of our 2022 net sales originating outside the U.S. and approximately 40% of our net sales originating in emerging markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Middle East/Northern Africa), our employees are located in over 50 countries to best serve our customers. Approximately 83% of our employees at year-end 2022 were located outside the U.S. and approximately 67% were located in emerging markets.  The charts below show our global employee population by region and operational function. Over 20,000 of our approximately 36,000 employees at year-end 2022, representing approximately 57% of our global workforce, were in Asia Pacific, serving our customers in that region. At that time, approximately 66% of our global workforce worked in the operations of our manufacturing facilities or in positions directly supporting them from other locations.

We provide ongoing support and resources to our teams worldwide to ensure that our employees\u2019 skills evolve with our business needs, industry trends and human capital management best practices and enable increased productivity, peak performance and career growth. We have robust talent review and succession planning processes, which provide individually targeted development opportunities for our team members. We emphasize on-the-job development and coaching, and also provide facilitator-led and direct-access online training, special projects and, in some cases, cross-functional or cross-regional work assignments.  Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts continue to gain momentum and create impact. Our commitment to inclusion guides our efforts in creating an engaging and inclusive employee experience in which every voice is valued. In 2021, following extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis to confirm our baseline position, we established four global pillars of focus, including:  improving fairness; increasing representation of women in manager and above roles - which increased from 35% in 2021 to 36% in 2022; increasing inclusion within our manufacturing population; and increasing representation and inclusion of underrepresented groups as defined by each geographic region. Since then, we have conducted extensive listening sessions around the globe to better understand both our strengths and areas of opportunity, and have deployed programmatic strategies such as leadership development programming targeting specific underrepresented talent pools, sponsorship, allyship and mentorship programs, connection events to build a culture of inclusion for our manufacturing employees in every region, and talent analytics and pipeline modeling to continuously advance our culture of inclusion.    Additionally, both Regional DEI Councils and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) continue to be an integral part of our DEI strategy. ERGs create opportunities for employees to learn and experience greater belonging. ERGs bring together employees who have shared interests and a common desire to make our company a more open and inclusive workplace. ERGs serve as a sounding board and a way for employees to collectively amplify their voices. Our ERGs currently include 24 groups focused on driving inclusion and advancement for women, employees of color, LGBTQ+ employees, veterans and others. In 2022, membership within our ERGs increased by 32% compared to 2021.   Pay & Benefits  Our compensation philosophy is to offer market-based, competitive wages and benefits in all markets where we compete for talent \u2013 all of our employees were paid at least the applicable legal minimum wage, and 98% of our employees were paid above the applicable legal minimum wage at year-end 2022. Pay is generally positioned around the market median, with variances based on knowledge, skills, years of experience and performance. In addition to base wages, our compensation and benefit programs \u2014 which vary by region, country and business unit \u2014 include short-term incentives, long-term incentives (e.g., cash- or stock-based awards), employee savings plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave and employee assistance programs.  We regularly evaluate pay equity, making adjustments where needed. In 2020, we expanded our review to include U.S. race/ethnicity in addition to gender globally, and in 2021, further increased the scope to include non-managerial professional employees as well as manufacturing employees in the U.S. In 2022, we expanded our analysis beyond base compensation to include target bonus compensation. We offer hybrid and remote work opportunities for much of our office-based workforce to provide greater flexibility to balance their work and personal commitments. We established guiding principles in 2021 to ensure that these arrangements meet the needs of our business while also supporting the needs of our employees. Our core infrastructure, information security and digital tools support efficiency and effectiveness for our employees wherever they work. Workforce Health & Safety  Safety is one of our highest priorities, and we continually work to ensure our manufacturing facilities, distribution centers and administrative offices focus on safety, so that anyone working in or visiting one of our locations feels and remains safe from injury. Our global Recordable Incident Rate of 0.23 in 2022 was significantly lower than the Occupational Safety and Health Administration manufacturing industry average of 3.3 in 2021 (the most recent available industry average).  Employee Engagement  Because we believe that an engaged workforce is a more innovative, productive and satisfied workforce, which promotes retention and minimizes employee turnover, we conduct a global employee engagement survey annually. Our business and functional teams use the anonymized results of our survey to identify and implement actions to address potential opportunities for improvement. While employee engagement is the result of many factors, we believe strong, encouraging and open leadership, as well as a continued effort to foster a collaborative, supportive culture, leads to strong workforce engagement. We want all our employees to strive to be their best and feel that they have the support necessary to deliver strong results for themselves and our company.  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Manufacturing and Environmental Matters  We use various raw materials \u2013 primarily paper, plastic films and resins, as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources \u2013 that are subject to price fluctuations. Although shortages can occur from time to time, these raw materials are generally available. In 2021 and the early part of 2022, we actively managed through a dynamic supply and demand environment in which demand across the majority of our businesses and regions was strong while supply chains were tight and raw material, freight and labor availability was constrained.  We produce a majority of our self-adhesive materials using water-based emulsion and hot-melt adhesive technologies. A portion of our manufacturing process for self-adhesive materials utilizes organic solvents, which, unless controlled, could be emitted into the atmosphere or contaminate soil or groundwater. Emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds, which are regulated by federal, state, local and foreign governments. We continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions. In connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment, we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions.  We have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents. Emulsion adhesives, hot-melt adhesives, and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities.  Based on current information, we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, consolidated financial position, results of operations or competitive position.  For information regarding our potential responsibility for cleanup costs at certain hazardous waste sites, see Note 8, \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
