Communities. We strive to contribute to the collective work needed to address the world\u2019s most pressing sustainable development issues through partnering with non-profit organizations and academic institutions who serve communities and society in powerful ways.  The Trimble Foundation Fund is a donor-advised fund that focuses its charitable giving across three areas\u2014natural disaster recovery and relief and climate resilience; female education and empowerment; and advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion\u2014while also supporting the philanthropic efforts of our local offices.  In addition, we are partnering with educational institutions worldwide to democratize education and to ensure that future industries are accessible, equitable, and sustainable.   Environment. We are committed to decarbonization and a net zero future.  We live this commitment within our operations and value chain, which is reflected in our science-based targets.  We help impact this transition through our products and services that generate productivity and efficiency gains that can reduce customers\u2019 GHG emissions.  In 2022, the Science Based Targets initiative (\u201cSBTi\u201d) approved our near-term science-based emissions reduction targets, which are aligned with requirements to keep warming to 1.5\u00b0C, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.  The approved targets are as follows: \u2022Reduce absolute scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50 percent by 2030 from a 2019 base year including achieving 100 percent annual sourcing of renewable electricity by 2025; \u2022Reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions (includes emissions from fuel and energy-related activities, business travel, and upstream transportation and distribution) by 50 percent by 2030 from a 2019 base year; \u2022Commit to partner with 70 percent of our suppliers by emissions covering purchased goods and services and capital goods to set science-based targets by 2026. Governance.  We continue to enhance our sustainability program management and monitoring.  Our sustainability team works under the supervision of our executive leadership team, with oversight by the Board of Directors, both of which fortify the governance and decision-making structure, while mitigating elements of risk.  We have taken progressive measures to align business accountability with sustainability performance.  Executive pay is linked to progress against climate action and diversity goals.  We also secured a revolving credit facility that links to our sustainability commitment.  Human Capital  Our culture reflects our guiding principles at work and is fundamental to sustaining our success.  That company culture is foundational to a thriving workplace; it is the behaviors and values of leaders and employees that are the foundation to who we are.  At Trimble, we value being yourself and thriving together; being intentional and humble; and being curious and solving problems.  Our leaders inspire purpose and vision, engage to draw out the best from each other, and strive to achieve meaningful results.  This mindset shapes how we treat one another and how we serve our customers, colleagues, and stockholders.  These attributes serve as a common foundation across the global organization and also adapt locally to diverse geographic and operational business models.  Commitment to these behaviors connects our employees. In the technology space, intellectual property and know-how derived from employees fosters innovation and serves as a competitive advantage.  To continue producing the innovative technologies for which we are known, it is crucial that we continue to attract, engage, develop, and retain top talent.  We strive to make Trimble a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and safe workplace and provide opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits, health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.    At the end of 2022, we employed 11,825 full-time and part-time employees, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time employees.  Approximately 48%, 30%, 18%, and 4% of employees reside in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the rest of the world.  Our employees are working in around 200 locations in over 40 countries.  Collectively, we speak more than 45 different languages.  We believe our diversity makes us stronger and better able to solve complex problems for our customers.   Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) We value diversity in our workforce, including various cultures, backgrounds, ages, genders, races and ethnicities, nationalities, sexual orientations, religions, people with different abilities, parents and caregivers, and many other characteristics, knowing that it drives our best thinking.  Our focus on diversity starts at the top.  Four out of our eleven board members are female or ethnically diverse, and we are making progress to increase global female employees and U.S. ethnically diverse employees in our workforce and in our leadership positions across the company.  In 2022, we made progress on many new initiatives focused  13 13 13 Table of Contents   Table of Contents  on infusing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the fabric of our connected culture.  Our Vice President of DEI and her core team cascade objectives that are aligned with our Trimble values and multi-year goals, while also encouraging local teams to focus on aspects of diversity that foster meaningful inclusion and belonging.  In business reviews, we discuss gender and U.S. ethnicity demographics and inclusion survey score trends for every business within Trimble, as well as region and business-led initiatives that are contributing toward our goals and progress.   We have a number of employee resource networks that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including networks that support women, caregivers, Black, Hispanic/Latinx and Indian professionals, veterans, employees with disabilities, and our LGBTQ+ community.  We are focused on measuring and increasing gender representation, as well as race and ethnic diversity in high-impact roles such as people leaders, engineering and technical positions, and sales.  We have provided increased access to diversity and inclusion educational resources, training, assessments, articles, and other employee forums to help us work together and more effectively across a variety of cultures globally.  We are committed to inspiring and attracting extraordinary and diverse talent.  The hiring and retention of top talent is always a strategic priority, and increasingly, a challenging one.  In addition, our increasing focus on technologies, such as cloud and autonomy, requires us to compete against leading companies in the technology sector.  Colleges and universities remain an important source of talented recruits.  We aim to transform and re-invent the way Trimble attracts and hires employees to increase diversity.  Initiatives include modifications to our recruiting process to ensure the inclusion of diverse, underrepresented candidates, developing relationships with universities with higher underrepresented student populations, creating diverse talent networks to promote Trimble job opportunities, and increasing networking and referrals with diverse professional organizations.   In 2022, we launched our second Renew Returnship program cohort that provides employment opportunities for those who have taken a break in their careers to look after their families.  We built new relationships with the National Society of Black Engineers and became a sponsor to Out & Equal, a non profit organization working on LGBTQ+ workplace equality.  We participated in many new national and local diversity career fairs and sponsored engagements focused on increasing gender and race/ethnic diversity in the industries we serve through groups like Transportation and Construction Girl.  We also increased our investments in education through new Trimble technology labs at Minority Serving Institutions and the Dr. Gladys West Scholarship Program through the Trimble Foundation, which honors a GPS technology pioneer and woman of color, and we award scholars at three universities serving underrepresented students. Compensation and Benefits We believe people should be paid for the role they perform and their skills and experience, regardless of their gender, race, age, or other personal characteristics.  To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee\u2019s role, their experience, their performance, and the region in which they live.  We also regularly review our compensation practices to ensure our pay is fair and equitable.  In addition to base salaries, certain roles are eligible to participate in short-term and long-term incentive plans. We offer market competitive benefit programs (that vary by country/region), which include health and wellness benefits, life insurance and disability benefits, flexible savings accounts, paid time off, parental and family leave, employee support programs, retirement plans, and an employee stock purchase plan.  Other benefits include fertility, adoption, and surrogacy education assistance; gender affirmation, family and caregiver support; flexible work schedules; education assistance; and on-site services such as health centers and fitness centers at some sites. Talent Development We are committed to providing every employee with the opportunity to learn, grow, and excel in a respectful and collaborative workplace.  Part of our people development mission is to create a culture of continuous learning and curiosity.  We believe that skills and abilities can be developed through training, relationships, and experiential learning.  We launched new career growth and development initiatives in 2022 to empower employees to identify internal job opportunities, skill development resources, and projects to achieve their personal development goals and full potential.  We encourage employees to nurture a love of continuous learning and a resilience that is essential for accomplishment.  We have a framework for people development that is employee-centric and evidence-based.  Employees and managers have frequent, casual conversations based upon employee survey data that drive engagement, career growth, and retention.  These surveys also include questions oriented around the Company\u2019s mission, vision, values, and purpose, work environment, diversity and inclusion, career development, and employee-manager relations.  Our internal worldwide training portal, Learn.Trimble.com, provides a set of resources that is easy to access anytime and anywhere, with a range of focus areas from new employees to existing employee development to manager development.   14 14 14 Table of Contents   Table of Contents  Building Connections  We believe that building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace.  Since our employees are passionate about a variety of causes, our company giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes.  In our offices around the world, our employee-led committees select local organizations to support, often in the form of grants and employee fundraising.  We also frequently collaborate with these organizations on volunteer activities for our employees.  Lastly, we encourage and provide our employees with a day of service as a benefit to help our communities.  Our Trimble Foundation aligns international philanthropic efforts by giving back to the communities where Trimble does business and helping those in need.  We do this by supporting three focus areas, disaster and climate resilience; female education and empowerment; and DEI, as well as by supporting the philanthropic efforts of our local offices.  Health, Safety, and Wellness The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people.  Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees.  We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations.  As COVID-related lockdowns subsided, we are supporting employees in transition to return to office and flexible working arrangements.
