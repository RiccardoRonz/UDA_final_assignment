Industry overview  Retail pharmacy  The retail pharmacy industry is highly competitive and dynamic with approximately 40,000 retail locations throughout the U.S. Pharmacists nationwide have been playing an increasingly important role in healthcare delivery over recent years and retail locations provide the much-needed access for a range of critical pharmacy and healthcare services, such as vaccinations and testing services. It is estimated that nearly 90 percent of the U.S. population lives within five miles of a retail pharmacy.   Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many chronic and acute medical conditions. The Company believes the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to a number of factors, including aging populations, higher prevalence of chronic disease, increases in availability of generic drugs, and the continued development of cost-effective innovative drug therapies. Further, in the U.S., some form of insurance coverage for individuals for prescription drugs is expanding, including for the \u201cbaby boomers\u201d, who are becoming increasingly eligible for federally funded Medicare Part D prescription benefits.     WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K1 WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K1  WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K1 WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 1 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  The retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third-party payors. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d) and health insurance companies, have consolidated over recent years to create larger healthcare entities with greater bargaining power. Third-party payors, including the Medicare Part D plans and state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the U.S., have the ability to change eligibility requirements and/or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to help control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation can also impact reimbursement rates and terms. As an example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cACA\u201d) was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending, including for prescription drugs, in the U.S. These changes generally have been aimed at reducing Medicaid reimbursements in the U.S. State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cIRA\u201d), which began to take effect in 2023, includes policies designed to have a direct impact on drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government. The IRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to Medicare if they increase prices faster than the inflation rate for drugs prescribed for Medicare beneficiaries. The mechanics of the rebate calculation mimic those of the Medicaid rebate, but the expansion of inflation-based rebates may further complicate pricing strategies, particularly with the availability of our new medications. When third-party payors or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions.  These industry dynamics and challenges have been ongoing and some have intensified in recent years. The Company has always had a continuous focus on driving operational efficiencies and cost reduction. Generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third-party payors. The Company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase and industry data shows that generic drugs and biosimilars represent approximately 90% of all prescriptions filled. In general, in the U.S., generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit dollars as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a \u201cgeneric conversion\u201d. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profits. In general, in the U.S., the specialty prescription business is also growing and generates higher sales dollars per prescription, but lower gross margin, as compared to generic prescription drugs.  The Company expects that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to evolve across the industries in which the Company competes. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and playing a greater role as part of patients\u2019 care teams than ever before. The Company believes rising healthcare costs and the need for greater care coordination with primary care and other providers present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payors through expanded service offerings and access.  Healthcare services  Transformation in healthcare services has accelerated following the COVID-19 pandemic. One critical catalyst for this change are the new ways that patients seek and access care and the increasing value they place on their overall healthcare experience. Across the industry, many patients and caregivers are forced to navigate a fractured, complex healthcare system, facing barriers to access and care coordination that can lead to higher costs and poorer health outcomes. There is a growing demand for convenient, accessible and affordable care, while many provider groups face staff shortages and a backlog of patients with unmet healthcare needs. Consequently, many patients feel frustrated with long wait times to see healthcare providers and struggle to navigate the complex system. Others opt to delay seeking care until necessary or critical, resulting in more severe health issues that can require more costly interventions and services later. The ability to influence and impact patients early in the healthcare value chain attracts providers and payors seeking new models to improve their clinical and financial performance.   WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K2 WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K2  WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K2 WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 2 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  The Company's U.S. Healthcare segment is a consumer-centric, technology enabled healthcare business that is powered by a nationally scaled, locally delivered healthcare platform, organically developed clinical programs and strategic collaboration with WBA's majority-owned businesses, including Village Practice Management Company, LLC (\u201cVillageMD\u201d), Shields Health Solutions Parent, LLC (\u201cShields\u201d) and CCX Next, LLC (\u201cCareCentrix\u201d). The Company is working to build a personalized, omni-channel experience across a world-class healthcare services organization, investing in primary care and the post-acute care management journey. The U.S. Healthcare segment endeavors to improve health outcomes and expand digital-forward services to make healthcare more accessible. This includes building a differentiated value-based care delivery model that successfully integrates pharmacy and medical care for a value-based care market that is expected to increase significantly by 2027. The Company\u2019s portfolio of assets is well suited to meet the demands of a healthcare market that is quickly moving from fee for service to value-based.  The Company is well positioned to leverage its core assets and competencies in pharmacy, retail and consumer engagement, along with a range of best-in-class healthcare assets and portfolio investments. This represents a growth opportunity to capitalize on by partnering with providers and health systems transitioning into value-based care payment models, enabling improved care delivery and augmenting existing care teams with integrated pharmacy and wrap-around services. Additionally, payors who are looking to differentiate their benefit design and performance through enhanced network access, lower cost services and innovative programs that enhance clinical quality stand to benefit.  See Note 17. Segment reporting to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein for further information.   Recent Developments The information set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the caption \u201cRecent Developments\u201d is incorporated herein by reference.   Segments The Company's operations are conducted through three reportable segments: \u2022U.S. Retail Pharmacy, \u2022International, and \u2022U.S. Healthcare.  In fiscal 2022, the Company changed the name of two reportable segments to better align with the Company\u2019s business activities, structure and strategy. The \u201cUnited States\u201d segment was renamed to \u201cU.S. Retail Pharmacy\u201d and the \u201cWalgreens Health\u201d segment was renamed to \u201cU.S. Healthcare\u201d. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the composition of the segments and therefore no change to the historical results of segment operations. The information for these segments for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has been presented using the new names.  In fiscal 2023, our segment sales were: U.S. Retail Pharmacy $110.3 billion, International $22.2 billion and U.S. Healthcare $6.6 billion. Additional information relating to our segments is included in Management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, and in Note 17. Segment reporting and Note 18. Sales to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.   U.S. Retail Pharmacy The Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment includes the Walgreens business which is comprised of the operations of retail drugstores, health and wellness services, specialty and home delivery pharmacy services, and its equity method investment in Cencora, Inc. (\u201cCencora\u201d), formerly known as AmerisourceBergen Corporation.   Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty, personal care and consumables and general merchandise. The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail offerings in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Company operated 8,701 retail stores in the segment as of August\u00a031, 2023. The principal retail pharmacy brands in the segment are Walgreens and Duane Reade. The Company is a market leader in the U.S. and, as of August\u00a031, 2023, approximately 78% of the population of the U.S. lived within five miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade retail pharmacy.  WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K3 WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K3  WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K3 WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 3 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  The Company is focused on creating a neighborhood health destination and a more modern pharmacy aligned to a wider range of healthcare services. Significant investments have accelerated the Company's customer-centric approach, with specific focus on transforming omni-channel capabilities and offerings across retail and healthcare. The Company\u2019s services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payors, including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBMs and the public sector. The Company utilizes its retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to its customers and patients, as illustrated by the Company\u2019s ability to play a significant role in providing vaccinations. Additionally, through our key collaborations, we aim to develop new healthcare delivery models and to improve the speed, efficiency and safety of the prescription fulfillment process. We have taken further steps to develop our neighborhood health destinations, to provide an integrated primary care and pharmacy model that aims to drive better health outcomes, reduce costs and provide a differentiated patient experience to the communities we serve.  The Company also provides specialty pharmacy and mail services and offers certain other health and wellness services throughout the U.S. The Company employs more than 85,000 healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals.  The segment provides customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise, such as NICE!, Free & Pure, No7, and Soap & Glory, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across the U.S. Integrated with the Company\u2019s e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive notifications when a refill is due and choose their delivery option, which includes in-store pick up, drive-through or delivery to their home.  The myWalgreens customer loyalty program provides an interface for customers to access the Company's enhanced and growing digital offering. The program allows members to receive discounts, in addition to earning Walgreens Cash rewards on storewide purchases. The cash benefit is applied as the customer chooses, not just to future transactions at Walgreens but also in support of the customer's favorite charity or community cause. The number of myWalgreens members continues to grow and as of August\u00a031, 2023, totaled approximately 113 million.  The Walgreens Find Care platform also includes telehealth service providers, connecting patients and customers with options to access convenient and affordable care from their mobile devices. Additionally, the Company has expanded the retail functionality of its mobile application, such as extending drive-through service to include retail products, curbside collection for online orders and same day offerings including pick up orders within 30 minutes. The segment is also implementing new approaches to promotions, product selection and other areas to deliver greater value to its customers in its stores.  The components of the segment\u2019s sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, health and wellness, beauty and personal care, and consumables and general merchandise). The segment\u2019s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the cough, cold and flu seasons and winter holiday. This seasonality also can affect the segment\u2019s proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the segment\u2019s fiscal year sales were as follows:\u00a0Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022Fiscal 2021Pharmacy74\u00a0%74\u00a0%76\u00a0%Retail26\u00a0%26\u00a0%24\u00a0%Total100\u00a0%100\u00a0%100\u00a0%  The Company filled 801 million prescriptions (including vaccinations) in the segment in fiscal 2023.\u00a0Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were 1.2 billion in fiscal 2023. The Company fills prescriptions under Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed or sponsored health benefit and prescription drug plans and programs, including the federal 340B drug pricing program. Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBMs and private insurance were approximately 97% of the segment\u2019s fiscal 2023 Pharmacy sales.  The Company fills prescriptions for many state and federal governmental health care programs, including Medicare Part D plans and Medicaid public assistance programs contributing to approximately 23% and 6%, respectively, of the segment\u2019s fiscal 2023 sales.  The Company's myWalgreens Credit Card program features the myWalgreens Mastercard and the myWalgreens Credit Card. These cards are the first ever of their kind to reward more personalized wellbeing choices and offer industry-leading rewards at Walgreens locations, Walgreens.com, Duane Reade stores, via the Walgreens mobile app, and wherever Mastercard is accepted.  WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K4 WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K4  WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K4 WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 4 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Cencora supplies and distributes substantially all generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the segment\u2019s pharmacies.\u00a0The Company purchases its non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers.   The segment\u2019s sales, gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of the Company\u2019s control can affect timing for a generic conversion, the Company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods.  The Company\u2019s pharmacy business is subject to ongoing prescription reimbursement pressure, a shift in the fulfillment of prescriptions every thirty days towards 90-day at retail, an increased volume of Medicare Part D prescriptions and increased consumer use of prescription discount cards.\u00a0Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry.   The Company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from PBMs, government, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third-party payors. Agreements with these payors are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and the Company\u2019s reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.  The Company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial third-party payors to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer.\u00a0The prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time.  The Company\u2019s 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides the Company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription. Similarly, the specialty prescription business, which generates higher sales dollars per prescription, may result in gross margin pressures within the industry, as compared to generic prescription drugs. The segment\u2019s performance is also impacted by the current environment, including adverse global macroeconomic conditions caused by factors including, among others, inflation, high interest rates, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and pandemics like COVID-19. For more information, see Risk factors in Item 1A.   International The International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the U.S. and the pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution business in Germany.   Pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include Boots branded stores in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), the Republic of Ireland and Thailand, the Benavides brand in Mexico and the Ahumada brand in Chile. Sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products. The Company operated 3,960 retail stores in the segment as of August\u00a031, 2023 (see Item 2. Properties, for information regarding geographic coverage) and has grown its omni-channel platform, including its online presence, in recent years. In the UK, the Company is a market leader and its retail stores are conveniently located with pharmacists well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities the Company serves.  The Boots omni-channel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands the Company owns, such as No7, Liz Earle, Soap & Glory, Botanics, Sleek MakeUp, Boots Pharmaceuticals and \u2018only at Boots\u2019 exclusive products, together with its long established reputation for trust and customer care. The Company\u2019s brands portfolio is enhanced by its in-house product research and development capabilities. The Company has introduced new beauty brands and beauty halls in key locations. Certain of the product brands of the Company are also sold by third-party retailers.  The Company\u2019s retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms. In the UK, through the boots.com website and integrated mobile application, the \u2018click and collect\u2019 service normally allows customers to order from a range of over 41,000 products online and collect the following day from approximately 75% of the UK\u2019s retail stores.

As of August\u00a031, 2023, the number of active Boots Advantage Card members (members who have used their card in the last six months) totaled approximately 14 million.  In addition, Boots in the UK is one of the leaders in the optical market with 543 practices, of which 164 operated on a franchise basis as of August\u00a031, 2023. Approximately 30% of these optical practices are located in Boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices.  The components of the segment\u2019s sales are Pharmacy (typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services, subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors) and Retail (primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty, toiletries and lifestyle merchandising, non-prescription drugs and, in the UK, the provision of optical services). Further, the segment also has a wholesale business in Germany with 32 distribution centers which distribute prescription medicines to pharmacies and other similar healthcare facilities.  The segment\u2019s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period. This seasonality affects the segment\u2019s proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the segment\u2019s fiscal year sales were as follows:  \u00a0Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022Fiscal 2021Pharmacy17\u00a0%17\u00a0%19\u00a0%Retail33\u00a0%32\u00a0%30\u00a0%Wholesale51\u00a0%51\u00a0%51\u00a0%Total100\u00a0%100\u00a0%100\u00a0%  The segment\u2019s Pharmacy sales, gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third-party payors seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare, including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates. In the UK, which is the segment\u2019s largest market for Pharmacy sales, the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis.  The segment\u2019s Retail sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category, specifically the Company and its competitors\u2019 pricing actions, promotional offers and events, and the customer\u2019s desire for value and convenience.  The segment\u2019s Wholesale sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, government actions, which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption, reduce reimbursement rates and increase utilization of generic drugs. A greater proportion of generic drugs, whether as a result of government actions, generic conversions or other factors, typically has an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues.  In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British pound sterling being the most significant.   The segment\u2019s performance and relevant exchange rates are also impacted by the current environment, including adverse global macroeconomic conditions caused by factors including, among others, inflation, high interest rates, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and pandemics like COVID-19. For more information relating to these topics, see Risk factors in Item 1A.   U.S. Healthcare The Company\u2019s U.S. Healthcare segment, created at the beginning of fiscal 2022, is a consumer-centric, technology-enabled healthcare business that engages consumers through a personalized, omni-channel experience across the care journey. The U.S. Healthcare segment delivers improved health outcomes and lower costs for payors and providers by delivering care through owned and partnered assets.  The U.S. Healthcare segment currently consists of a majority position in VillageMD, a national provider of value-based care with primary, multi-specialty, and urgent care providers serving patients in traditional clinic settings, in patients\u2019 homes and online appointments; Shields, a specialty pharmacy integrator and accelerator for hospitals; CareCentrix, a participant in the post-acute and home care management sectors, and the Walgreens Health organic business that contracts with payors and providers to deliver clinical healthcare services to their members and members\u2019 caregivers through both digital and physical channels.

The Company owns numerous domain names, holds numerous patents, has registered numerous trademarks and has filed applications for the registration of a number of other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions. The Company holds assorted business licenses (such as pharmacy, occupational, liquor and cigarette) having various terms within multiple legal jurisdictions, which are necessary for the normal operation of the business.   Seasonal variations in business The Company\u2019s business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, the severity of COVID-19 and the efficacy of current vaccines, its sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of its own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third-party payors.   See the summary of quarterly results (unaudited) in Note 20. Supplementary financial information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.   Sources and availability of raw materials Inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. The Company does not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on its business or that of any of its segments.   Working capital practices Effective inventory management is important to the Company\u2019s operations. The Company uses various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Its working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. The Company generally finances its inventory and expansion needs with internally-generated funds and short-term debt.   For further information, see the liquidity and capital resources section in Management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7.   Customers The Company sells to numerous retail and wholesale customers. The Company also provides healthcare services to healthcare payors\u2019 eligible members, cash-pay patients, and health systems and provider groups. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s consolidated sales for any of the periods presented. In fiscal 2023, substantially all of our retail pharmacy and healthcare services sales were to customers covered by third-party payors (e.g., PBMs, insurance companies and governmental agencies) that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer's eligible prescription purchases. Three third-party payors accounted for approximately 33% of the Company\u2019s consolidated sales in fiscal 2023.  See Note 17.
