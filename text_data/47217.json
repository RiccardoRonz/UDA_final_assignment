Sales, Marketing and Distribution We manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above. Our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups, and purchases of HP products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by HP or indirectly through a variety of partners, utilizing their own physical or internet stores or an omnichannel combination of the two, including: \u2022retailers that sell our products to the public focusing on consumers and SMBs; \u2022resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer groups; \u2022distribution partners that supply our products and solutions to resellers and retailers in certain geographies; and \u2022system integrators and other business intermediaries that provide various levels of services, including systems integration work and as-a-service solutions, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our products and services. The mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel sales differs by business and geographic market. We believe that customer buying patterns and different geographic market conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing and distribution efforts to the geographic market and sub-geographic specificities for each of our businesses. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our market coverage while identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect routes to market. Our businesses collaborate to accomplish strategic and process alignment where appropriate. For example, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise and drives both direct and indirect sales to their assigned customers. For other customers and for consumers, we typically manage both direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers mainly targeting consumers and SMBs and commercial resellers mainly targeting SMBs, mid-market accounts, public sector and large enterprises. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014 If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer\u201d in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Manufacturing and Materials We utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers (\u201cOMs\u201d) around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. The use of OMs\u00a0is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for HP-designed products. We use multiple OMs\u00a0to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes. In some circumstances, third-party suppliers\u00a0produce products that we purchase and resell under the HP brand. Additionally, we manufacture finished products from components and sub-assemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors. We utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units to match a customer\u2019s hardware and software customization requirements. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers. We purchase materials, supplies and product sub-assemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing or readily available alternate sources of supply. However, we have relied on sole sources for some laser printer engines, LaserJet supplies, certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations, mitigating the effect of a disruption). For instance, we source the majority of our A4 and a portion of A3 portfolio laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from Canon. Any decision by either party not to renew our agreement with Canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from LaserJet products; however, we have a long-standing business relationship with Canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement. We are dependent upon Intel and AMD as suppliers of x86 processors and Microsoft and Google for various software products. We believe that disruptions with these suppliers would have industry-wide ramifications, and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014We are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected, and could adversely affect in the future, our financial results\u201d in Item\u00a01A, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional information on our reliance on single-source suppliers. Like other participants in the information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120\u00a0days. From time to time, we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources. We also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or price increases and enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supplies. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014We are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected, and could adversely affect in the future, our financial results\u201d in Item\u00a01A, which is incorporated herein by reference. 6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Sustainability also plays an important role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products. We strive to make our products and packaging in an ethical and sustainable manner. We have committed to building an efficient, resilient and sustainable supplier network, and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions, and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations. These actions, together with our broader sustainability program, help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations, such as supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosures. For more information on our sustainability goals, programs, and performance, including our methodology for calculating progress towards our GHG and other sustainability goals, we refer you to our annual Sustainable Impact Report, available on our website (which is not incorporated by reference herein). International Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet both consumer and enterprise customers\u2019 demand on a worldwide basis and draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce. This provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. We believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build future growth. See \"Risk Factors\u2014Due to the international nature of our business, geopolitical or economic changes or events, uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance\" and \"We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our results\" in Item 1A, which are incorporated herein by reference. Research and Development Innovation across products, services, business models and processes is a key element of our culture and success. Our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products, services and solutions that anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs and desires, and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers\u2019 experiences. Our research and development efforts are supported by various groups across our business segments. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position. For a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see \u201cRisk Factors\u2014If we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer\u201d in Item\u00a01A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Patents Our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At October\u00a031, 2023, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 23,000 patents. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is essential to HP as a whole or to any of HP\u2019s business segments. In addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) from third parties. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses, and other rights, under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties. For a discussion of risks attendant to IP rights, see \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot develop, obtain, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Third-party claims of IP infringement are commonplace in our industry and may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services\u201d in Item\u00a01A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Seasonality General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. Historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and may be impacted by supply constraints, shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impacts of macroeconomic challenges and different demand dynamics. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable,\u201d in Item\u00a01A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Competition We encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity. We compete on the basis of technology, innovation,  performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products,  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents account relationships, customer training, service, support and solutions including subscription-based offerings and financing, security, availability of application software, and our sustainable impact.  The markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs\u00a0that design, manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive. We have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other digital access devices, imaging and printing-related products and services. We are the leader or among the leaders in each of our key business segments. The competitive environment in which each key segment operates is described below: Personal Systems. The markets in which Personal Systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition and introduction of new products and solutions. Our primary competitors are Lenovo Group Limited, Dell Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Acer Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Apple Inc., Toshiba Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd and Logitech International S.A. In particular geographies, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or \u201cwhite box\u201d manufacturers. Our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio, our innovation, and research and development capabilities including security features, our innovative design work, our brand and procurement leverage, our ability to cross-sell our portfolio of offerings, our extensive service and support offerings and the accessibility of our products and execution of our broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales. Printing. The markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive. Printing\u2019s key customer segments each face competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products. Our primary competitors include Canon Inc., Lexmark International, Inc., Xerox Corporation Ltd., Seiko Epson Corporation, The Ricoh Company Ltd. and Brother Industries, Ltd. In addition, independent suppliers offer non-original supplies (including imitation, refill and remanufactured alternatives), which are often available for lower prices but which can also offer lower print quality and reliability compared to HP original inkjet and toner supplies. These and other competing products are often sold alongside our products through online or omnichannel resellers, retailers or distributors, or such resellers, retailers and distributors may highlight the availability of lower cost non-original supplies. Our competitive advantages include our comprehensive high-quality solutions for the home, office and publishing environments, our innovation, and research and development capabilities including security features, sustainability, our brand, and the accessibility of our products through a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales. For a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors, see \u201cRisk Factors\u2014We operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance,\u201d in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Sustainability   At HP, we believe how we do things is just as important as what we do. Our Sustainable Impact goals reflect our efforts to tackle key issues in Climate, Human Rights, and Digital Equity as follows:  Climate Action: Taking urgent and decisive action to achieve net zero carbon emissions across our entire value chain, give back more to forests than we take, and innovate our products and services for a more circular economy. Among our goals:  \u2022Achieve net zero greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions across HP\u2019s value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2040, with a 50% reduction in absolute value chain GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2019; \u2022Reach 75% circularity for products and packaging by 2030; \u2022Continue to source only sustainable fiber for all HP-brand paper and paper-based packaging and counteract deforestation for non-HP paper used in our products and print services; Human Rights: Building a culture of equality and empowerment within HP and beyond, where diversity is sought out and celebrated, and where universal human rights are understood and respected. Among our goals: \u2022Achieve 50/50 gender equality in HP leadership by 2030; \u2022Achieve greater than 30% technical women and women in engineering roles by 2030;  \u2022Meet or exceed labor market representation for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. by 2030; \u2022Reach one million workers through worker empowerment programs by 2030, since the beginning of 2015; \u2022Double the number of Black/African American executives by 2025, from a 2020 baseline; Digital Equity: Accelerating equitable access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunity for those who are traditionally excluded so they can participate and thrive in a digital economy. Among our goals: \u2022Accelerate digital equity for 150 million people by 2030, since the beginning of 2021; 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Enable better learning outcomes for 100 million people by 2025, since the beginning of 2015; \u2022Enroll 1.5 million HP LIFE (Learning Initiative for Entrepreneurs) users between 2016 and 2030; \u2022Contribute 1.5 million employee volunteering hours by 2025 (cumulative since the beginning of 2016); \u2022Contribute US$100 million in HP Foundation and employee community giving by 2025 (cumulative since the beginning of 2016); For more information on our Sustainable Impact strategy, programs, and a complete list of goals and performance, we refer you to our annual Sustainable Impact Report, available on our website (which is not incorporated by reference herein). Environment Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. Many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use, including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. Most of our products also are subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption. In addition, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, and their safe use. We proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain, taking into account, among other things, published lists of substances of concern, new and upcoming legal requirements, customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment.    We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as \u201cproduct take-back legislation\u201d). We are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to sustainability issues such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, reusing or recycling. We intend for our products to be easily reused and recycled, and we provide many of our customers with reuse and recycling programs. In the event our products become non-compliant with these laws or standards, our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions or from being procured by certain governments or private companies, and we could face other sanctions, including fines. Our operations, supply chain and our products are currently, and expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change, such as climate disclosure, carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements, requiring us to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines. We strive to continually improve the energy and carbon efficiency of our operations, supply chain and product portfolio and deliver more cost-effective and lower carbon technology solutions to our customers. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements. We are committed to complying with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. This commitment is reflected and outlined in our sustainable impact goals, our comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services. A liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. For a discussion of risks attendant to these environmental factors, see \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations and cash flows\u201d in Item\u00a01A, which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, for a discussion of our environmental contingencies see Note\u00a014, \u201cLitigation and Contingencies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item\u00a08, which is also incorporated herein by reference. Human Capital HP employs about 58,000 employees in 59 countries. Together, they power HP innovation by applying their diverse skills and perspectives to create transformative solutions for our partners and customers worldwide. Our aim is to attract and retain exceptional talent by providing engaging work experiences that help our employees thrive. We promote ongoing learning and development, offer comprehensive compensation and benefits, and focus on health, safety, and well-being to set employees up to do their best work and  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents achieve their career aspirations. To deliver on these priorities, HP senior leaders are accountable for meeting management by objective (MBO) goals for employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and leadership development.  Employee Engagement We regularly collect feedback from employees to better understand and improve their workplace experiences and to identify ways to strengthen our culture. In fiscal year 2023, 91% of employees participated in our annual survey, and we continued to see strong overall engagement, exceeding top quartile benchmarks for most of the external comparisons we track. We saw similar strength on our internal inclusion index, and employees demonstrated their engagement by providing a high volume of written comments in this year\u2019s survey. Beyond the annual survey, we regularly seek out employee feedback through a variety of pulse polls and take action to address their ideas, suggestions, and concerns.   Talent and Learning We have a multi-faceted talent, learning, and skill-development strategy. First, we emphasize diversity of backgrounds, experience, and perspectives in our senior talent pipeline, and invest in targeted approaches such as leadership assessments, external education opportunities, coaching, job rotations, and immersive, experiential learning to ensure our executives are equipped to lead HP, both now and in the future. We also support emerging, technical, and underrepresented talent through an extensive portfolio of internal and external development programs designed to accelerate their career growth. Additionally, we prepare new people managers with a development experience designed, among other things, to build coaching skills and champion inclusion. We are also committed to the continuous growth of employees. We provide enterprise-wide skill development solutions and resources that focus on the critical skills all employees need to perform at their best in their jobs today and in the future. In partnership with industry thought partners and internal experts, HP offers learning opportunities in key areas such as software development, artificial intelligence, data science, product management, communications, change agility, and strategic thinking. HP prioritizes skill development experiences that accommodate employee-specific needs and demanding schedules, with an emphasis on learning that drives immediate application and measurable behavior change.  In addition to skill development resources, HP also offers formal education assistance through our Degree Assistance Program which provides employees with the opportunity to participate in higher academic education. In fiscal year 2023, 99% of employees participated in learning and development sponsored by HP, completing an estimated average of 32 hours per person. The 2023 annual employee engagement survey revealed that 83% of employees felt HP actively supported their learning and development, with 82% believing that they are given a real opportunity to improve their skills at HP. Finally, HP encourages ongoing collaboration between people managers and employees to create personalized plans that accelerate skill development and prepare employees for additional opportunities. Our data show that 80% of employees have specific development actions they are working on in collaboration with their managers. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) We strive to create an inclusive, equitable workplace where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work and reach their full potential. This commitment is at the heart of our innovation model, where people with diverse perspectives, backgrounds, knowledge, and experiences collaborate to create breakthrough technologies and deliver valued solutions to our customers. Our commitment to DEI starts at the top with a highly knowledgeable, skilled, and diverse board of directors. We are also among the top technology companies for women in executive positions. Globally, women hold 32.7% of HP\u2019s full-time leadership positions. We are committed to improving representation of women at HP overall, with a focus on leadership and technical roles worldwide. We also strive to ensure equal opportunities and access for employees from underrepresented groups. For example in fiscal year 2023, 45% of our external U.S. hires were racially or ethnically diverse. We continue to work on removing barriers for underrepresented employees, providing internal programs and development opportunities as well as training for managers on inclusive leadership. Pay Equity People should be paid equitably for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other protected characteristics. We benchmark and set pay ranges based on relevant market data and consider factors such as an employee\u2019s role, experience, skills, and performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to make sure our pay is fair and equitable. For the past seven years, we have reviewed employees\u2019 compensation with the support of independent third-party experts to ensure consistent pay practices. In fiscal year 2023, we expanded our annual pay equity assessment to include 17 countries with our largest employee populations, representing approximately 85% of our global workforce. The independent analysis did not reveal any systemic issues and we addressed areas of potential concern as part of our off-cycle compensation process.  Health, Safety, and Wellness The holistic wellbeing of our employees is vital to HP\u2019s success. Our environmental, health, and safety leadership team uses our global injury and illness reporting system to assess worldwide and regional trends as a part of quarterly reviews. We continue to focus on reducing and effectively managing risks at HP-owned and partner-owned manufacturing facilities, and injury rates continue to be low. 10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents We sponsor a global wellness program designed to enhance wellbeing for all HP employees. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors across our five pillars of wellness\u2014physical, financial, emotional, life balance, and social/community\u2014through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. In addition to our regular annual wellbeing programs, we provide specialized programs and campaigns in line with employee needs at the time. Our campaign this year, \u201cBetter Me in \u201923,\u201d encouraged employees to prioritize themselves and their wellbeing by using mindfulness apps, targeted mental health support, individual assessments, and expanded financial wellbeing programs. Hybrid Work Strategy We continue to embrace hybrid ways of working, consistent with flexible working guidelines we adopted in July 2021. At HP, hybrid work balances workplace flexibility with time working together to collaborate and connect in person at our sites. Our goal is to provide the ability to work seamlessly across a diverse ecosystem of workplaces, enabled by enhanced tools and technology designed to optimize productivity and collaboration.  We are testing different approaches to making hybrid work effective at multiple pilot sites globally, seeking feedback from HP employees on how best to support them in new ways of working. Overall, we aim to preserve the flexibility offered by hybrid work arrangements while offering our employees a healthy, supportive, and inclusive environment that supports their development, provides connection, and propels team and individual performance.
