Operations The Company transports people and cargo throughout North America and to destinations in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America. UAL, through United and its regional carriers, operates across six continents, with hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport (\"EWR\"), Chicago O'Hare International Airport (\"ORD\"), Denver International Airport (\"DEN\"), George Bush Intercontinental Airport (\"IAH\"), Los Angeles International Airport (\"LAX\"), A.B. Won Pat International Airport (\"GUM\"), San Francisco International Airport (\"SFO\") and Washington Dulles International Airport (\"IAD\").  All of the Company's domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers, contributing to a large amount of \"origin and destination\" traffic.\u00a0The hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly.\u00a0The hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft.\u00a0As discussed under Alliances below, United is a member of Star Alliance, the world's largest alliance network. United Next. Our United Next plan is our fundamental strategic evolution for driving future growth that we believe will have a transformational effect on the customer experience and earnings power of our business. As part of our United Next plan, in June 2021 we announced our firm order for the purchase of 270 new Boeing and Airbus aircraft, which at the time was the largest combined order in the airline's history and the biggest by an individual carrier in the last decade. In December 2022, we announced the largest widebody order by a U.S. carrier in commercial aviation history (100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners with  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents options to purchase 100 more), the exercise of options to purchase 44 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft for delivery between 2024 and 2026, the firm orders of 56 more Boeing 737 MAX aircraft for delivery between 2027 and 2028 and the acquisition of an additional 100 options to purchase additional Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. We now expect to take delivery of about 700 new narrow and widebody aircraft by the end of 2033. Our groundbreaking United Next strategy is expected to increase United's average gauge in North America, to increase the total number of available seats per departure and to significantly lower carbon emissions per seat. United will retrofit 100% of its mainline, narrow-body planes with its signature interior that includes seat-back entertainment in every seat, larger overhead bins for every passenger's carry-on bag and the industry's fastest available in-flight WiFi, as well as a bright look-and-feel with LED lighting. The carrier's international widebodies will feature the United Polaris\u00ae business class seat as well as United Premium Plus\u00ae seating. The Company plans to replace older, smaller mainline jets and at least 200 single-class regional jets with larger aircraft, which we expect will lead to fuel efficiency benefits compared to older planes, including an expected 17-25% lower carbon emissions per seat compared to older planes. We believe that United Next will allow us to differentiate our network and segment our products with a greater premium offering while also maintaining fare competitiveness with low-cost carriers. Regional. The Company's business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network, with regional capacity accounting for approximately 8% of the Company's total capacity for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express. This regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our hubs and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. CommuteAir LLC (\"CommuteAir\"), Republic Airways Inc. (\"Republic\"), GoJet Airlines LLC (\"GoJet\"), Mesa Airlines, Inc. (\"Mesa\"), SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (\"SkyWest\") and Air Wisconsin Airlines LLC (\"Air Wisconsin\") are all regional carriers that operate with capacity contracted to United under capacity purchase agreements (\"CPAs\"). The Company plans to wind down its CPA with Air Wisconsin in 2023 as part of its United Next plan to reduce service on single-cabin 50-seat regional jets. Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable rate adjustment based on agreed performance metrics, subject to annual adjustments. The fees are based on specific rates multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g.,\u00a0block hours, departures), as well as fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is also responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In some cases, the Company owns some or all of the aircraft subject to the CPA and leases such aircraft to the regional carrier. In return, the regional carriers operate the capacity of the aircraft included within the scope of such CPA exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus loyalty program. Alliances. United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world. In 2022, Star Alliance carriers continued to serve more than 1,200 airports in 184 countries with approximately 14,000 average daily departures. Star Alliance members, in addition to United, are Aegean Airlines, Air Canada, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways (\"ANA\"), Asiana Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Aerov\u00edas del Continente Americano S.A. (\"Avianca\"), Brussels Airlines, Copa Airlines, Croatia Airlines, EGYPTAIR, Ethiopian Airlines, EVA Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, SWISS, TAP Air Portugal, THAI Airways International and Turkish Airlines. In addition to its members, Star Alliance includes Shanghai-based Juneyao Airlines and Thailand-based Thai Smile Airways, a subsidiary of THAI Airways International, as connecting partners and Germany-based Deutsche Bahn, a rail company, as an intermodal partner. United has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with Star Alliance members, addressing, among other things, reciprocal earning and redemption of frequent flyer miles, access to airport lounges and, with certain Star Alliance members, codesharing of flight operations (whereby one carrier's selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier). In addition to the alliance agreements with Star Alliance members, United currently maintains independent marketing alliance agreements with other air carriers, including Aeromar, Aer Lingus, Air Dolomiti, Airlink Proprietary Limited, Azul Linhas A\u00e9reas Brasileiras S.A. (\"Azul\"), Boutique Air, Cape Air, Edelweiss, Emirates, Eurowings, Eurowings Discover, flydubai (in process of completion), Hawaiian Airlines, JetSuiteX, Inc. (\"JSX\"), Olympic Air, Silver Airways, Virgin Australia Airlines Pty Ltd and Vistara.  United also participates in four passenger joint business arrangements (\"JBAs\"): one with Air Canada and the Lufthansa Group (which includes Lufthansa and its affiliates Air Dolomiti, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Edelweiss, Eurowings, Eurowings Discover and SWISS) covering transatlantic routes, one with ANA covering certain transpacific routes, one with Air New Zealand covering certain routes between the United States and New Zealand, and one with Air Canada, established in July 2022, covering certain United States and Canada transborder routes. These passenger JBAs enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they provide in the respective regions, capturing revenue synergies and delivering enhanced customer  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents benefits, such as highly competitive flight schedules, fares and services. Separate from the passenger JBAs, United also participates in cargo JBAs with ANA for transpacific cargo services and with Lufthansa for transatlantic cargo services. These cargo JBAs offer expanded and more seamless access to cargo space across the carriers' respective combined networks. United and Emirates entered into a commercial agreement (and United and flydubai are in the process of completing a commercial agreement) to enable passengers to book travel on a single ticket making check-in and luggage transfer faster and easier. United will launch a new direct flight between Newark/New York and Dubai starting in March 2023\u2014from there, customers can travel on Emirates or its sister airline flydubai to more than 100 different cities. This agreement will also give the loyalty program members of both airlines more opportunities for more rewards: United MileagePlus\u00ae members flying on United's Newark/New York to Dubai flight can soon earn and redeem miles when connecting beyond on Emirates and flydubai and Emirates Skywards members will be able to earn miles when they travel on United operated flights. Eligible United customers will also soon have access to Emirates lounges when connecting to and from United's new Dubai flight.  Loyalty Program. United's MileagePlus loyalty program builds customer loyalty by offering awards, benefits and services to program participants. Members in this program earn miles for flights on United, United Express, Star Alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Members can also earn miles by purchasing goods and services from our network of non-airline partners, such as domestic and international credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels and car rental companies. Members can redeem miles for free (other than taxes and government-imposed fees), discounted or upgraded travel and non-travel awards. United has an agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"Chase\"), pursuant to which members of United's MileagePlus loyalty program who are residents of the United States can earn miles for making purchases using a MileagePlus credit card issued by Chase (the \"Co-Brand Agreement\"). The Co-Brand Agreement also provides for joint marketing and other support for the MileagePlus credit card and provides Chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the Company's customer database. In 2022, approximately 5.6\u00a0million MileagePlus flight awards were used on United and United Express. These awards represented approximately 7.3% of United's total revenue passenger miles. Total miles redeemed for flights on United and United Express, including class-of-service upgrades, represented approximately 92% of the total miles redeemed. In addition, excluding miles redeemed for flights on United and United Express, MileagePlus members redeemed miles for approximately 1.2\u00a0million other awards. These awards include United Club memberships, car and hotel awards, merchandise and flights on other air carriers. Air Cargo. United provides freight and mail transportation services (air cargo). The majority of air cargo services are provided to commercial businesses, freight forwarder and logistics firms as well as national postal services. Through our global network, our cargo operations are able to connect the world's major freight gateways. We generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft, and starting in 2020, the use of our passenger aircraft for cargo-only flights. The use of cargo-only flights significantly decreased in 2022 due to the return of passenger demand. Distribution Channels. The Company's airline seat inventory and fares are distributed through the Company's direct channels, traditional travel agencies and online travel agencies (\"OTA\").\u00a0The use of the Company's direct sales website, www.united.com, the Company's mobile applications and alternative distribution systems provides the Company with an opportunity to de-commoditize its services, better present its content, make more targeted offerings, better retain its customers, enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs. Agency sales are primarily sold using global distribution systems (\"GDS\").\u00a0United has developed and expects to continue to develop capabilities to sell certain ancillary products through the GDS channel to provide an enhanced buying experience for customers who purchase in that channel.  Third-Party Business. United generates third-party business revenue that includes maintenance services, frequent flyer award non-travel redemptions, flight academy and ground handling. Third-party business revenue is recorded in Other operating  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents revenue. Expenses associated with third-party business, except non-travel redemptions, are recorded in Other operating expenses. Non-travel redemptions expenses are recorded to Other operating revenue.  Aircraft Fuel. The table below summarizes the fuel consumption and expense of UAL's aircraft (including the operations of our regional partners operating under CPAs) during the last three years.  YearGallons Consumed(in millions)Fuel Expense(in millions)Average Price Per GallonPercentage of Total Operating Expense20223,608\u00a0$13,113\u00a0$3.63\u00a031\u00a0%20212,729\u00a0$5,755\u00a0$2.11\u00a022\u00a0%20202,004\u00a0$3,153\u00a0$1.57\u00a015\u00a0% Our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. The Company routinely enters into purchase contracts based on expected fuel requirements for UAL aircraft (including regional partners operating under CPAs) that are generally indexed to various market price benchmarks for aircraft fuel. These contracts customarily do not provide material protection against changes in market prices or guarantee the uninterrupted availability of adequate quantities of aircraft fuel. The price of aircraft fuel used by our operations has fluctuated substantially in the past several years. The Company's current strategy is to not enter into financial transactions to hedge the market price exposure of its expected fuel consumption, although the Company regularly reviews its strategy based on market conditions and other factors. Industry Conditions Domestic Competition. The domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic. The Company's competitors consist primarily of other airlines and, to a certain extent, other forms of transportation. Currently, any U.S. carrier deemed fit by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the \"DOT\") is largely free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the United States. Competition can be direct, in the form of another carrier flying the exact non-stop route, or indirect, where a carrier serves the same two cities non-stop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport. Air carriers' cost structures are not uniform and are influenced by numerous factors. Carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers, which could have a potential negative impact on the Company's revenues. Domestic pricing decisions are impacted by intense competitive pressure exerted on the Company by other U.S. airlines. In order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels, we often find it necessary to match competitors' discounted fares. Since we compete in a dynamic marketplace, attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares often fail. International Competition. Internationally, the Company competes not only with U.S. airlines, but also with foreign carriers. International competition has increased and may continue to increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions, JBAs, alliances, restructurings, liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors. Competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation. The Company's ability to compete successfully with non-U.S. carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire United States via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide. Foreign carriers currently are prohibited by U.S. law from carrying local passengers between two points in the United States and the Company generally experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries. Separately, \"fifth freedom rights\" allow the Company to operate between points in two different foreign countries and foreign carriers may also have fifth freedom rights between the U.S. and another foreign country. In the absence of fifth freedom rights, or some other extra-bilateral right to conduct operations between two foreign countries, U.S. carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities. To compensate partially for these structural limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into alliances, immunized JBAs and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other's flights and route networks. Through these arrangements, the Company strives to provide consumers with a growing number of seamless, cost-effective and convenient travel options. See Alliances, above, for additional information. Seasonality. The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters, driving higher revenues, than in the first and fourth quarters, which are periods of lower travel demand. Environmental, Social and Governance Approach and Highlights Climate Strategy The Company's commitment to operating an environmentally sustainable and responsible airline is woven into its long-term strategy and its values. The Company believes that it is critical, now more than ever, to continue to serve its purpose of connecting people and uniting the world, and is committed to finding solutions, both individually as a company, and together  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents with partners in both the private and public sectors, to do so sustainably and responsibly while also achieving its financial goals. The Company is continuously looking for new ways to reduce its environmental impact in the air, on the ground and at its facilities, which benefits its employees, customers and stockholders. At the end of 2020, the Company pledged a net zero goal to eliminate its greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions by 100% by 2050 without relying on the use of traditional carbon offsets, like planting trees or purchasing voluntary offsets. United was the first airline globally to make such a commitment without relying on the use of traditional offsets. Reliance on such offsets would allow emissions derived from within the value chain of the Company to remain unabated. Given the airline industry's designation as a 'hard-to-abate sector', the Company believes that not relying on traditional carbon offsets is important and the right priority because the airline industry should focus on decarbonization within its own activities as the industry cannot afford to divert resources and attention toward offset programs that do not effectuate real progress within aviation operations. The Company's earnest intention on meeting the net zero GHG emission goal by 2050 led the Company to commit to a mid-term objective of reducing, compared to 2019, its carbon intensity by 50% by 2035. This carbon intensity target is intended to align the Company's net zero goal with the temperature limit goals of the Paris Agreement and allow the Company to show progress towards its 2050 net zero GHG emissions goal in the nearer term. In 2021, the Company also committed to validating this 2035 target with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The Company is committed to redefining the future of air travel with environmental sustainability at the forefront because it believes that it is the Company's responsibility to take tangible steps to mitigate climate change impacts from its operations. In addition, the Company's climate goals and overall climate strategy are increasingly important factors in its relationships with its employees and customers. Its strategy to achieve its climate goals is centered around four key pathways, each of which is described in further detail below: (i) reducing the Company's environmental footprint, (ii) innovating for potentially transformative carbon reduction technologies, (iii) removing the Company's atmospheric carbon impacts and (iv) collaborating with employees, customers, airports, suppliers, cross-industry partners and policymakers to facilitate faster action and the commercialization of technology solutions concerning climate change. The Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), including through its Public Responsibility Committee, provides oversight of its climate-related goals and strategy to ensure integration with its core business strategy and management periodically updates the Board on the implementation of the Company's climate-related goals and strategy. The Board, including through its Public Responsibility Committee, also oversees management's identification, evaluation and monitoring of environmental (including climate-related) trends, issues, concerns, risks and opportunities that affect or could affect the Company's reputation, business activities, strategies and performance. \u2022Reducing Environmental Footprint: As part of this plan, the Company is focused on maximizing fuel efficiency and reducing fuel usage in its operations. The main focus in realizing this objective is reducing its fossil jet fuel consumption, which is both the largest contributor to its environmental footprint and a sizable expense for the Company. The Company's primary effort in reducing its fossil jet fuel consumption is directed on working with strategic partners to scale, employ and commercialize the use of sustainable aviation fuel (\"SAF\"). SAF is the most promising technology solution realized today that can abate emissions from the Company's flight operations. SAF can reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 85% compared with conventional jet fuel and has the added benefits of having a limited impact on performance or safety and providing energy diversification. The Company is the U.S. aviation leader in SAF production investment based on publicly announced offtake agreements of certain airlines for future purchases of SAF as of the date hereof. However, SAF supply in the jet fuel market is constrained today and represents, according to industry estimates, far less than 1% of global commercial aviation fuel usage. Additionally, the purchase of SAF today comes with a price premium, compared to conventional jet fuel, to account for the additional costs of scaling and producing this early-stage solution. These challenges with present-day SAF have informed the Company's strategy of investing in SAF producers and technology to help scale the SAF market and unlock future supply for the Company. The Company uses SAF in its regular operations from World Energy at LAX and Neste at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and has purchased nearly 8 million gallons of SAF since 2016. However, as of December 2022, the total volume of SAF the Company used in its operations remained less than 0.1% of its total aviation fuel usage. \u25e6In 2015, the Company began its strategy of SAF investment, by making a $30 million equity investment in Fulcrum BioEnergy, Inc. (\"Fulcrum\"), a company working to commercialize SAF production from municipal solid waste. With this investment, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement with Fulcrum, which provides United the opportunity to purchase at least 900 million gallons of SAF. \u25e6In 2016, the Company became the first airline globally to use SAF in regular operations on an ongoing basis with SAF from World Energy. \u25e6In 2021, the Company launched its first-of-its-kind Eco-Skies Alliance program in which corporate and cargo customers agreed to collectively fund the price premium for SAF. As of the end of 2022, customers had committed to fund approximately 9 million gallons of SAF. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u25e6In December 2021, the Company made aviation history by operating the first passenger flight using 100% SAF in one engine from Chicago to Washington, D.C. The flight showcased the safety of SAF and the potential for a dramatically reduced carbon footprint for aviation.  \u25e6In 2022, the Company signed a purchase agreement with Neste for up to 52.5 million gallons of SAF for use at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and potentially other airports. With this agreement, United became the first U.S. airline to execute an international purchase agreement for SAF. \u25e6In 2022, the Company expanded its SAF investment portfolio through an investment in NEXT Renewables, becoming the first U.S. airline to invest in a biofuel refinery, which\u2014at full production\u2014could produce up to 50,000 barrels per day of SAF, renewable diesel and other renewable fuels. \u25e6In 2023, the Company formed a joint venture, Blue Blade Energy (\"Blue Blade\"), with Tallgrass Energy and Green Plains Inc. to commercialize SAF technology using ethanol as the feedstock. If the technology is successful, the Company has entered into an offtake agreement with Blue Blade to receive up to 135 million gallons of SAF annually for up to 2.7 billion gallons in total\u2014the Company's largest offtake agreement.  Alongside developing and using SAF, the Company is concentrated on introducing newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft into its fleet as well as improving the efficiency of its existing fleet. From 1990 to 2022, the Company improved its mainline fuel efficiency by approximately 48%. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company announced its United Next plan and entered into firm narrow-body aircraft orders for 200 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and 70 Airbus A321neo aircraft. A subsequent firm order was placed in 2022 for 100 Boeing 787 aircraft (with options to purchase up to an additional 100 Boeing 787 aircraft) and the Company also exercised an option to purchase 44 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, finalized an order for an additional 56 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and increased the number of options to purchase Boeing 737 MAX aircraft by an additional 100. Collectively, the introduction of the new aircraft into the fleet is expected to result in 17%-25% lower carbon emissions per available seat-mile (\"ASM\") compared to older planes. In conjunction with its SAF strategy and improving the fuel efficiency of its fleet, the Company has been revamping its flight and ground operations, including implementing operational and procedural initiatives to drive fuel conservation. Over 4,100 units of the Company's ground service equipment (\"GSE\") around the world are electric or use alternative fuels and, as of the end of 2022, approximately 34% of its GSE fleet has been electrified. The Company has worked collaboratively across its organization and with Air Traffic Control (\"ATC\") providers to improve fuel efficiency through the implementation of best practices, by providing training to its pilots and dispatchers and supplying them with the tools needed to execute on those strategies. \u2022Innovating in Carbon Reduction Technology: The Company has been forming, through its corporate venture capital arm, United Airlines Ventures (\"UAV\"), collaborations with, as well as investing in, early-stage climate technology companies that have the potential to scale and support the Company's climate targets or are generally supportive of advancing sustainability within the broader economy. \u25e6In 2021, the Company announced, through UAV, investments in aerospace technologies, like electric vertical takeoff and landing (\"eVTOL\") aircraft (through its investment in Archer Aviation), electric aircraft (Heart Aerospace) and hydrogen-electric engines (ZeroAvia) to advance technologies with a potential to help decarbonize air travel in the future, once regulatory approvals are obtained. \u25e6In September 2022, UAV announced an addition to its eVTOL investment portfolio with an investment in Eve Air Mobility (\"Eve\"), a company that is developing an electric four-seater aircraft. Along with the investment, the Company entered into a conditional purchase agreement for 200 aircraft with Eve, with expected first deliveries as early as 2026, once regulatory approvals are obtained. \u25e6In November 2022, UAV broadened its technology investment portfolio to include clean energy infrastructure with an investment in Natron Energy, a battery manufacturer developing novel sodium-ion batteries. Natron's technology has the potential to help reduce the GHG footprint of United's ground operations by helping to electrify its airport GSE.  \u2022Removing Carbon Impact: The Company intends to extend its environmental sustainability efforts beyond reducing emissions by also focusing on carbon removal by investing in carbon capture technologies to either sequester carbon or potentially utilize captured carbon to make low-carbon fuels. In 2020, the Company became the first airline to announce a commitment to invest in direct air capture, a carbon capture and sequestration technology, and since then has broadened its investment approach to also include technologies that can utilize captured carbon to make high-value, low-carbon products.  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u25e6In December 2021, UAV invested in Dimensional Energy (\"Dimensional\"), a novel technology startup that converts carbon dioxide (\"CO2\") and water into fuel, primarily SAF. Along with the investment, the Company and Dimensional also reached a commercial agreement for the Company to purchase at least 300 million gallons of SAF over 20 years. \u25e6In March 2022, UAV and Oxy Low Carbon Ventures announced an investment in biotech firm Cemvita Factory to commercialize the production of SAF intended to be developed through a revolutionary new process using CO2 and synthetic microbes. \u25e6In December 2022, UAV invested in Svante, a developer of carbon capture and removal technology using structured adsorbent beds, also known as filters. It is important to note that certain of these technology solutions pertaining to both carbon reduction and carbon removal innovations need time to reach commercial viability. Despite this and other hurdles, the Company believes that these solutions show potential for scale and future reduction of GHG emissions.  \u2022Collaborating with Partners: The Company has devoted a significant amount of time and energy on defining a better future of flying by collaborating with employees, customers, airports, suppliers, cross-industry partners and policymakers to scale the supply of decarbonization technology solutions, minimize its environmental impact, boost environmental sustainability of the airline industry and protect the environment, all of which are key to advancing the Company's climate goals. \u25e6The Company has historically supported the adoption of more aggressive industry targets, with both Airlines for America (\"A4A\") and the International Air Transport Association committing in 2021 to net-zero emissions by 2050 for domestic and international carriers, respectively. In addition, the Company along with other A4A members have pledged to work towards the Biden Administration's SAF Grand Challenge to collectively make 3 billion gallons of SAF available domestically by 2030. \u25e6The Company worked with federal policymakers to champion passage of the Sustainable Skies Act SAF Blender's Tax Credit through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \"IRA\"). This credit creates an economic incentive for increased SAF production within the United States. \u25e6The Company is a founding member of the Biden Administration's First Movers Coalition, a collective of leading companies committing to purchase low-carbon technologies in hard-to-abate sectors. As part of its membership, the Company has committed to using emerging technologies with significant emissions reductions by 2030 and has also set a target of replacing at least 5% of conventional jet fuel demand with SAF that reduces lifecycle GHG emissions by 85% or more compared with conventional jet fuel by 2030.  \u25e6At the international level, the Company was the only U.S. airline that attended the 2022 UN Conference of the Parties (\"COP27\") climate conference, to continue its engagement with policymakers on aviation decarbonization strategies. Additional quantitative emissions data for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 follow this paragraph. The Company believes that its absolute GHG emissions will increase in the immediate future as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's operations continues to lessen and the Company implements its United Next strategy and continues to grow. In addition, even though purchasing carbon offsets could present near-term emissions reductions, as outlined above, the Company is resolute in attaining its mid-term and long-term climate goals without relying on the use of traditional carbon offsets to support its voluntary climate targets and has made progress towards implementing solutions that are needed to permanently change aviation and reduce the environmental impact of air travel to protect our planet for generations to come. Such commitment is demonstrated by the end of the Company's customer offset program and elimination of emission reductions realized by carbon offsets as reflected in its 2021 GHG inventory. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Carbon Emissions20212020Direct (Scope 1) GHG Emissions in Metric Tons CO2eGross GHG emissions21,375,27515,490,070SAF emissions reductions(4,790)(4,708)Net GHG emissions21,370,48515,485,363Indirect Emissions in Metric Tons CO2eIndirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions160,794175,087Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions5,561,7454,280,317Total GHG Emissions in Metric Tons CO2eGross GHG emissions27,093,02419,940,767Carbon offsets (a)\u2014(4,106)Net GHG emissions27,093,02419,936,661Carbon Emissions Intensity Rates (b)20212020Emissions Intensity per Revenue ton-mile (\"RTM\")Mainline RTMs (millions) (c)15,3719,755Metric tons CO2e/1,000 mainline RTMs (d)1,4011,605Emissions Intensity per ASMASMs (millions) (e)178,684122,804Regional metric tons CO2e/1,000 mainline and regional ASMs (f)151161(a)Offset purchases made in 2020 were part of discrete promotional campaigns.

Our ability to make these connections, as well as to build long-term value for our shareholders and contribute to the broader community, depends on our commitment to attract and retain the best talent at all levels of our organization and across our global workforce. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive through our human capital management strategy to create lifelong careers for the people of United. That includes professional development and promotional opportunities and the ability to qualify for retirement benefits, health and wellness benefits and, of course, travel privileges, as we remain dedicated to providing the best place for our employees to work. Our core4 (we are safe, then caring, dependable and efficient) serves as the framework for how we take care of our customers and each other and how we make decisions as a team. For United, our shared purpose is about more than getting people from one place to another and executing our strategic priorities: it means that as a global company that operates in hundreds of locations around the world with millions of customers, we have a unique responsibility and opportunity to drive meaningful change in the places where we fly by creating exciting, rewarding and long-term careers for tens of thousands of people who live in the communities that we serve. Demographics: As of December 31, 2022, UAL, including its subsidiaries, had approximately 92,795 employees consisting of approximately 23,065 flight attendants, 16,129 passenger service agents, 15,088 ramp service agents, 13,831 pilots, 8,499 technicians and related flight simulator technicians, 965 storekeeper employees, 393 dispatchers, 336 fleet tech instructors, load  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents planners, maintenance instructors and security officers and 14,489 management and other personnel. Approximately 84% of the Company's employees were represented by various U.S. labor organizations at year-end 2022. As of December 31, 2022, of our U.S. employees, approximately 39% were female and approximately 49% self-identified as part of an underrepresented racial or ethnic group. Our workforce diversity metrics are reported regularly to the executive team and to the Board. The Board believes that its membership should continue to reflect a diversity of gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation and gender identity and is committed to actively seeking women and minority candidates for the pool from which director candidates are chosen in support of the Board's commitment to diversity.

Diversity tracking is prohibited by law in some international locations. Numbers may not sum due to rounding. Connecting People. Uniting the World: The following programs, policies and initiatives encompass some of the objectives and measures that we continue to focus on as part of our human capital management strategy: \u2022Workplace Safety: At United, safety is first in everything we do and is our first core4 service standard. We are focused on promoting our safety culture to ensure that every employee across the Company holds each other to the highest safety standards. Our comprehensive, formalized approach to managing the safety of everyone at the Company is through our enterprise-wide Safety Management System (\"SMS\"), which is governed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, is implemented, overseen and cascaded by the Company's Corporate Safety team and is delivered by divisional teams with regular training and monitoring. The SMS helps us assure that we are adhering to our safety standards, communicating those standards across all of our divisions and departments and identifying safety hazards. The SMS also confirms that our safety risk mitigations are working properly (mainly through audits). We have also established a \"United Safety Excellence Program\" that recognizes United locations with exceptional safety performance and commitments to safety. As of December 31, 2022, we have certified 35 United locations, which is aligned with our certifications pre-COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Company has onsite clinic locations in four of its hubs that provide care to active employees, including, but not limited to, services related to occupational injury, Company-directed exams, acute care for personal illness, pre-employment exams, travel immunizations and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") audiometric testing. For all other locations, United has partnered with third-party clinics to provide such services. Additionally, the Company actively follows the recommendations of the CDC and since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented additional safety measures in compliance with CDC guidelines.  The Board, including through its Public Responsibility Committee, provides oversight of the Company's policies, positioning and practices concerning various broad public policy issues, including those that relate to safety and public health (including workplace and customer safety and security), and the full Board is provided with a safety update at every Board meeting. 11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (\"DEI\"): At United we are on a mission to become the best airline in the history of aviation and change the face of the aviation industry by creating pathways for a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace. To achieve this goal, we must ensure that our airline, team members, practices and our policies reflect our global customer base and the communities we serve. Our DEI strategy is centered around transforming the future of aviation in the following ways:  \u25e6creating greater awareness, access and opportunities for underrepresented groups to create long, lucrative careers at United;  \u25e6growing our uniquely inclusive culture; \u25e6offering a more accessible and culturally sensitive travel experience for all of our customers;  \u25e6empowering our communities; and  \u25e6modeling active leadership to build a strong pipeline for business diversity.  We are making progress in diversifying our leadership and key talent pipelines, including pilots and technicians, and we are holding ourselves accountable by setting goals tied to our executive compensation plans. Our comprehensive approach to sustainable progress includes building customized strategies for each functional area of our business to attract, develop and support diverse talent in the advancement of their careers at United. In 2022, our new hire representation of women and people of color in management and administrative roles was higher by approximately 5% and 9%, respectively, when compared to beginning of year representation. A key contributing factor to this growth was setting a goal to have 90% of interview slates include a diverse set of candidates. In 2022, we also increased representation at the officer level where 60% of officer promotions were women and 40% were people of color. Our highly engaged employee-led Business Resource Groups (\"BRG\") are also helping to drive our strategies and grow our inclusive culture. Our 44 BRG chapters with 2022 memberships totaling approximately 27,000 memberships worldwide build cultural awareness and allyship for the various communities they represent\u2014Black, LGBTQ+, multicultural, multigenerational, people with disabilities, veterans, women, and working parents and caregivers. Each of our eight BRGs is sponsored by a member of our executive team. In the summer of 2021, United opened the United Aviate Academy (the \"Academy\") with a goal for at least half of the pilot graduates to be women or people of color. Since April 2021, we have received approximately 20,000 applications. The Academy has completed its first full year of operations with the inaugural graduating class in January 2023. Students enrolled in the first year of operation were 43% women and 74% people of color. The Academy is designed to set its graduates up for a career that reflects United's high standard of professionalism and deep commitment to delivering a safe, caring, dependable and efficient travel experience.  Not only does the Academy publicly establish our commitment to diversity, but our partnerships for pilot recruiting at three Historically Black Colleges and Universities (\"HBCUs\") enable us to support organizations that have a long history of serving underrepresented communities. The Academy's pilot recruiting program provides a new and effective path to a United flight deck and partnering with HBCUs gives United the opportunity to further our efforts to diversify our employee base and flight decks. Elizabeth City State University, Hampton University and Delaware State University are the core of the Academy's commitment to HBCUs. We are also enhancing awareness and access for underrepresented groups to careers as aircraft maintenance technicians through Calibrate, our new in-house apprenticeship program launched in November 2022. We plan to train more than 1,000 new technicians by 2026, with a goal of at least half being women or people of color. Our first cohort was comprised of 80% people of color. In the 36-month program, apprentices will gain the skills and knowledge to obtain their A&P Certificate, including hands-on and classroom training and mentorship alongside United's experienced technicians. Calibrate plans to expand to over a dozen locations in 2023, will be open to United's global employee base and external candidates and will be key in helping United achieve its goal of hiring 7,000 maintenance technicians by 2026. Through our skills-first hiring approach, we are prioritizing a focus on the skills, capabilities and talent a candidate brings to the table rather than categorically excluding talent for not having a four-year college degree.  \u2022We are one of over 60 leading employers who have partnered with OneTen, an organization focused on addressing the racial wealth gap through skills-first hiring. We have committed to doing our part to help the organization lead the upskilling, hiring and promotion of one million Black people without a four-year college degree into family-sustaining careers over the next 10 years. Since joining, United has hired over 2,000 employees that contribute to our partnership commitment with OneTen. 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022We host two cohorts of students each year with our talent partner Year Up, a nonprofit that empowers young, talented professionals to move into careers in a single year by providing technical and professional skills training for entry-level roles and connecting them with their first corporate experience. This helps build skills and experiences that will empower them to reach their potential, while giving hiring managers access to a motivated, diverse talent pipeline. Last year, we set a goal that 80% of each cohort would be hired as United team members and we exceeded that goal in August 2022 with 100% of our cohort being hired and on the path to a long, lucrative career as highly engaged team members. Pay equity is a key tenet of our rewards strategy because it promotes an environment in which all employees feel valued and respected. In 2021, we disclosed that we have achieved near-perfect pay equity for employees of all genders and races performing comparable work across our U.S. operations. In 2022, we continued our commitment to conducting annual reviews of our pay practices, including among managers, to maintain pay equity. Our commitment to diversity and empowerment extends from our workforce and continues in our relationships with our suppliers as we recognize that we can meet our business needs while supporting economic growth in marginalized communities. In 2021, we announced our aspiration to become a member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable (\"BDR\"), a group of corporations recognized for spending at least $1 billion annually with diverse-owned businesses. We have built a strong foundation to keep us on track and are working to improve the rate of inclusion for diverse-owned businesses in our supply chain. In 2022, we more than doubled our spend with diverse and women-owned businesses and added more than 80 new diverse suppliers to our supply chain. \u2022Board Oversight: Our Board, assisted by several of its committees, plays a key role in the strategic oversight of management regarding the development, implementation and effectiveness of the Company's policies and strategies relating to human capital management. For instance, the Board's Executive Committee oversees and reviews significant human capital strategies, including culture, talent management and DEI matters, and the Board's Public Responsibility Committee reviews and monitors the development and implementation of the Company's DEI and strategic goals and objectives. Many of our Board members have experience overseeing workforce issues as CEOs and presidents of other companies or organizations. The Compensation Committee also engages an independent compensation and benefits consulting firm to help evaluate our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against a group of peer companies, including peers within the airline industry. \u2022Career Growth and Development and Succession Planning: We offer a broad range of professional training and education for the career advancement and leadership development of our employees. In 2022, about 90% of our senior leader positions filled were internal placements and 513 frontline employees were promoted into management roles, almost three times as many as the prior year. Our key leadership development programs include structured nomination programs for high potential leaders with a focus on diverse representation and opportunities for all employees to develop their careers. Rise and LEAD are 6-month targeted programs for high-potential directors, senior managers and managers who are focused on developing strategic thinking, innovation, business acumen and executive presence skills, including through executive coaching and action learning projects. The Airport Operations Leadership Academy provides development opportunities for all employees and supports United's goal to build a robust, diverse leadership talent pipeline. The Airport Operations Leadership Academy provides courses, experiential learning and mentoring that can lead to certification in technical, technology and leadership skills. Our commitment to mentoring and sponsorship is reflected in several programs implemented through BRGs, departments such as Inflight and Airport Operations and the Academy. Succession planning provides us the opportunity to evaluate our key successors, create curated development plans for them and align on gaps to begin the process of proactively identifying external talent for director and above positions. Executives engage in succession planning by continuously evaluating, developing and mentoring our high potential talent and providing them with advancement opportunities to ensure they are prepared when executive and management positions become available. The Board also engages in annual succession planning and talent development discussions with our Chief Executive Officer, focusing on our ability to identify, attract, prepare and retain talented employees for future leadership positions. \u2022Employee Engagement: We routinely conduct confidential employee engagement surveys of our global workforce, which provide feedback on employee satisfaction and engagement and cover a variety of topics such as company culture, safety and values, execution of our strategy, diversity, equity and inclusion and individual development, among others. Survey results are reviewed by our executive team, who analyze opportunities for progress both at a company level as well as at a function level. Individual managers also use survey results to implement actions and activities intended to increase the well-being of our employees. We believe that our employee engagement initiatives, competitive pay and benefit programs and career growth and development opportunities help increase employee satisfaction and tenure and reduce voluntary turnover. 13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Talent and Pay: While our rewards package for most of our employees is defined by our collective bargaining agreements, it includes competitive base pay, travel privileges and other comprehensive benefits, including health, wellness and retirement programs for all our employees, including part-time employees. We also review both industry and local market data at least annually to identify trends and market gaps in order to maintain the competitiveness of our compensation and employee benefit programs. With respect to executives, a substantial proportion of their total rewards is variable, at-risk pay that is based on Company performance and delivered in the form of equity, supporting alignment over the long term between our executives and our shareholders. We align our executives' long-term equity compensation with our shareholders' interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance. In addition, the Company has performance-based compensation programs for other management employee leaders, including managers, supervisors and team leads.  \u2022Collective Bargaining Agreements: Collective bargaining agreements between the Company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the Railway Labor Act (\"RLA\"). Such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date, upon which the agreement is considered \"open for amendment.\" The following table reflects the Company's represented employee groups, the number of employees per represented group, union representation for each employee group, and the amendable date for each employee group's collective bargaining agreement as of December 31, 2022: Employee GroupNumber of EmployeesUnionAgreement Open for AmendmentUnited Airlines, Inc.:Flight Attendants 23,065Association of Flight Attendants (the \"AFA\")August 2021Fleet Service15,088International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (the \"IAM\")December 2021Pilots13,831Air Line Pilots AssociationJanuary 2019Passenger Service11,649IAMDecember 2021Technicians8,499International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the \"IBT\")December 2022Storekeepers965IAMDecember 2021Dispatchers 393Professional Airline Flight Control Association (the \"PAFCA\")December 2024Fleet Tech Instructors180IAMDecember 2021Load Planners69IAMDecember 2021Security Officers45IAMDecember 2021Maintenance Instructors42IAMDecember 2021United Ground Express, Inc.:Passenger Service 4,480IAMMarch 2025 In November 2022, United dispatchers represented by the PAFCA voted to ratify a two-year contract extension.

We are committed to transparency and accountability as we work to better reflect the diversity of the communities we serve in all areas of our business and, to track our progress, have committed to sharing our U.S. workforce demographic data by self-identified race, ethnicity and gender on an annual basis on our website. The information contained on or connected to the Company's website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report filed with the SEC. Industry Regulation Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory oversight. The following discussion summarizes the principal elements of the regulatory framework applicable to our business. Regulatory requirements, including but not limited  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents to those discussed below, affect our operations and increase our operating costs, and future regulatory developments may continue to do the same. In addition, should any of our governmental authorizations or certificates be modified, suspended or revoked, our business and competitive position could be materially adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u2014\"The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, which imposes significant costs and may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition\" for additional information on the material effects of compliance with government regulations.  Domestic Regulation. All carriers engaged in air transportation in the United States are subject to regulation by the DOT. Absent an exemption, no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a DOT certificate of public convenience and necessity. The DOT also grants international route authority, approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition. The DOT regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising, denied boarding compensation, tarmac delays, baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future. The DOT has launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts.  Airlines are also regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (the \"FAA\"), an agency within the DOT, primarily in the areas of flight safety, air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness. The FAA issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates, prescribes maintenance procedures, oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training. From time to time, the FAA issues directives that require air carriers to inspect, modify or ground aircraft and other equipment, potentially causing the Company to incur substantial, unplanned expenses. The airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security. The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines. Labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the RLA, a federal statute. The Company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the DOT, FAA, DOJ, DHS, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\"), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\"), OSHA and other U.S. and international regulatory bodies. Airport Access. Access to landing and take-off rights, or \"slots,\" at several major U.S. airports served by the Company are subject to government regulation. Federally-mandated domestic slot restrictions that limit operations and regulate capacity currently apply at three airports: Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., and John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in the New York City metropolitan region. Additional restrictions on takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be implemented in the future and could affect the Company's rights of ownership and transfer as well as its operations. Legislation. The airline industry is subject to legislative actions (or inactions) that may have an impact on operations and costs. In 2018, the U.S. Congress approved a five-year reauthorization for the FAA that will expire in September 2023. Discussions in connection with the reauthorization could include a wide range of tax and policy issues. Potential policy changes for consideration could include airline customer service requirements, aviation safety, investments in FAA staffing and resources, advancements in improving air traffic control (\"ATC\") technology, labor requirements and managing new entrants in the National Air Space. These issues could impact the Company and larger airline industry. Congressional action on reauthorization is expected to occur after the September 2023 expiration date, and in that case, Congress will likely pass an extension of current law to prevent any lapse in taxing authority. International Regulation. International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. In connection with the Company's international services, the Company is regulated by both the U.S. government and the governments of the foreign countries or regions the Company serves. In addition, the availability of international routes to U.S. carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Legislation. Foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws, rules and regulations that meet or exceed U.S. requirements. In cases where this activity exceeds U.S. requirements, additional burden and liability may be placed on the Company. Certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation from the Company and/or enforcement penalties in addition to changes in operating procedures due to overbooked, canceled or delayed flights. Airport Access. Historically, access to foreign routes has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the U.S. and each foreign jurisdiction involved. These agreements regulate the routes served, the number of carriers allowed to serve each route and the frequency of carriers' flights. Since the early 1990s, the U.S. has pursued a policy of \"Open Skies\" (meaning all U.S. and foreign carriers have access to the destination) under which the U.S. government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between U.S. and foreign points. Currently, there are more than 100 Open Skies agreements in effect. However, even with Open Skies, many of the airports that the Company serves in Africa, the Middle  15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents East, Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America maintain slot controls. A large number of these slot controls exist due to congestion, environmental and noise protection and reduced capacity due to runway and ATC construction work, among other reasons. The Company's ability to serve some foreign routes and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the U.S. government and the relevant foreign governments. Shifts in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements. Depending on the nature of any such change, the value of the Company's international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished. Similarly, foreign governments control their airspace and can restrict our ability to overfly their territory, which may enhance or diminish the value of the Company's existing international route authorizations and slot rights. Epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may cause governments to restrict entry of passengers and/or to impose health management rules which can include vaccinations, boosters, testing, quarantine upon arrival, health declarations and temperature screens, among others. Such requirements may result in reduced demand for travel in certain circumstances and may cause the Company to suspend certain international services. Although certain governments may grant waivers for limited periods that allow the Company to maintain existing slot rights and route authorizations while not operating at a particular foreign point, waivers are not guaranteed.  Environmental Regulation. The airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international environmental regulations, including those regulating emissions to air, water discharges, safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes. The Company endeavors to comply with all applicable environmental regulations. Climate Change. As outlined above, the Company's commitment to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company extends beyond seeking to comply with regulatory requirements. At the same time, efforts to reduce carbon emissions through environmental sustainability legislation and regulation, or non-binding standards or accords, is an increased focus of global, national and regional regulators. A policy to regulate GHG emissions from aviation known as the European Union (\"EU\") Emission Trading System (\"ETS\") was adopted in 2009, but applicability to flights arriving at or departing from airports outside the EU has been postponed several times. In December 2017, the European Parliament voted to extend exemptions for extra-EU flights until December 2023 in order to align with the completion of the pilot phase of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (\"ICAO\") Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"). More recently, the European Parliament and Council reached a provisional agreement to extend exemptions for extra-EU flights from 2023 to 2027. The extension of EU ETS to extra-EU flights could still occur in future years, depending on the EU government's assessment of the effectiveness of CORSIA. CORSIA, which was adopted in October 2016, is intended to create a single global market-based measure to achieve carbon-neutral growth for international aviation, through airline purchases of eligible carbon offset credits and the use of eligible sustainable fuels. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted ICAO to include only 2019 emissions (as opposed to the originally planned average of 2019-20 emissions) as the baseline upon which offsetting obligations would be calculated for the pilot phase (2021-23) of the scheme. At the conclusion of the 2022 ICAO Assembly's 41st Session in October 2022, the ICAO Assembly passed a resolution establishing the baseline for the subsequent phases of CORSIA at 85% of 2019 emissions. This decision is expected to substantially increase United's anticipated CORSIA compliance costs as compared to a 2019-only baseline, although the exact mechanism by which CORSIA will be implemented domestically is currently unknown. Certain CORSIA program aspects could also potentially be affected by the results of the pilot phase of the program, and thus the impact of CORSIA cannot be fully predicted. Domestically, in December 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO airplane CO2 emission standards. In June 2022, the same standards were proposed by the FAA, the agency responsible for enforcing the standard at the time of aircraft certification, and are awaiting a final rule. The Company believes that policies that incentivize the production of SAF, such as the passage of tax credit incentives for the production of SAF in the IRA, or economy-wide carbon prices or taxes, will enable the Company to decarbonize its operations more cost efficiently than a patchwork of regulatory requirements on aviation, particularly those that require airlines to reduce flights or impose the cost of transitioning to low-carbon alternatives disproportionately on airlines. The Company lauded the U.S. government's passage of the IRA and will continue to work with policymakers to adopt policies that incentivize the production of SAF to allow the industry to transition to a lower carbon future. In addition, while the Company is resolute in attaining its mid-term and long-term climate goals without relying on voluntary use of traditional carbon offsets, the Company may be subject to future regulatory requirements that require the purchase of carbon offsets, which may expose the Company to additional costs associated with the procurement of offsets or limited supply in the carbon offsets market. The Company believes that policies that incentivize in-sector emissions reductions, rather than carbon offset purchases, will better support the industry's transition to a lower carbon future. 16 16 16 Table of Contents Table of Contents Other Regulations. Our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the United States and internationally. These include noise-related restrictions on aircraft types and operating times and state and local air quality initiatives which have resulted, or could in the future result in curtailments in services, increased operating costs, limits on expansion, or further emission reduction requirements. Certain airports and/or governments, both domestically and internationally, either have established or are seeking to establish environmental fees and other requirements applicable to carbon emissions, local air quality pollutants and/or noise. The implementation of these requirements is expected to result in restrictions on mobile sources of air pollutants such as cars, trucks and airport ground support equipment in corresponding locations.  Various states have passed legislation restricting the use of Class B fire-fighting foam agents that contain intentionally added per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS\"), which are requiring the Company to continue to incur costs to convert existing fixed foam fire suppression systems to accommodate PFAS-free firefighting foam agents. In addition, the EPA has developed the PFAS Strategic Roadmap, which includes regulatory actions across a wide spectrum of its statutory authorities, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. In August 2022, EPA proposed to designate two PFAS substances, perfluorooctanoic acid (\u201cPFOA\u201d) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (\u201cPFOS\u201d) as hazardous substances under CERCLA. The proposed rule would authorize the EPA to order cleanup actions and hold responsible parties liable under CERCLA's joint and several liability scheme. The proposed rule would also require the Company to immediately report releases that meet or exceed the reportable quantity of PFOA or PFOS to the EPA and any other applicable state and local agencies. The Company expects these broad regulatory policies will increase the risk of incurring remediation costs and/or liabilities at current and former locations at which the Company currently or historically used fire-fighting foam agents containing PFOA, PFOS or other PFAS substances. To mitigate these risks, the Company is working to remove PFAS-containing fire-fighting foam from its hangars and other assets through a phased retrofit/replacement strategy, and is committed to transitioning to PFAS-free materials for fire suppression. Finally, environmental cleanup laws could require the Company to undertake (or subject the Company to liability for costs associated with) investigation and remediation actions at certain owned or leased locations or third-party disposal locations. Because PFOA, PFOS and other PFAS substances are expected to be regulated under CERCLA and have been regulated other environmental cleanup laws, the Company may become subject to potential liability for its historic usage of PFAS-containing materials, although such potential liability is not expected to be significant. Until the applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined and/or until pending regulations are finalized, future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain but are likely to increase our operating costs over time.  While the Company is required to comply with numerous applicable environmental regulations, the Company believes that these regulations and programs, including the pilot phase of CORSIA, EPA regulations regarding PFAS and GHG emissions, and other existing environmental regulations, are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's results or competitive position. However, the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the Company are difficult to predict, and the financial impact to the Company and the aviation industry could be significant.
