Business  \u00a0 Overview \u00a0 Generac is a leading energy technology solutions company that provides backup and prime power generation systems for residential and commercial &\u00a0industrial (C&I) applications, solar + battery storage solutions, smart home energy management devices and energy services, advanced power grid software platforms, and engine- & battery-powered tools and equipment.\u00a0As an energy technology solutions company that is \u201cPowering a Smarter World\u201d, our corporate purpose is to lead the evolution to more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy solutions around the world. \u00a0 We have a long history of providing power generation products across a variety of applications, and we maintain one of the leading market positions in the power equipment markets in North America and an expanding presence internationally. We believe we have one of the widest ranges of products in the power generation marketplace, including residential, commercial and industrial standby generators; as well as portable and mobile generators used in a variety of applications.\u00a0In recent years, the Company has been evolving its business model to focus on building out an ecosystem of energy technology products, solutions, and services for home and business purposes.\u00a0As part of this evolution, we have made significant investments into rapidly growing markets such as residential clean energy storage, solar module-level power electronics (MLPE), and energy monitoring & management devices, all of which are distributed energy resources (DERs) that can be aggregated into virtual power plants (VPPs) within grid services programs. In addition, we have been leveraging our leading position in the growing market for natural gas fueled generators, which we believe represents a cleaner transition fuel to more renewable and energy storage sources compared to diesel, to expand into applications beyond standby power, allowing us to participate in Energy-as-a-Service and microgrid projects for C&I customers. \u00a0 We have also made investments in next-generation platforms and controls for both residential and C&I applications that facilitate the connection of our products to the grid.\u00a0Expanding these capabilities will enable the increasing utilization of our equipment as DERs as the nascent market for grid services expands over the next several years. Our growing presence in grid services programs will enhance the value of our power generation and storage products that might otherwise sit idle, as they are now able to be dispatched and orchestrated as part of a distributed energy solution, thereby generating additional return-on-investment for the home or business owner while also delivering value to utilities and grid operators by helping to balance, support and enhance the reliability of the electrical grid.\u00a0As the traditional centralized utility model evolves over time, we believe that a more decarbonized, digitized, and decentralized grid infrastructure will build-out, and Generac\u2019s energy technology solutions are uniquely and strategically positioned to participate in this next-generation grid referred to as \u201cGrid 2.0\u201d. \u00a0 As our traditional power generation markets continue to grow due to multiple mega-trends that are driving increased penetration of our products, we believe we are in an excellent position to execute on this opportunity given our competitive strengths.\u00a0In addition, our focus on more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions has dramatically increased our served addressable market, and as a result, we believe that Generac is well-positioned for success over the long term. \u00a0 Company History \u00a0 Generac was founded in 1959 to commercialize a line of affordable portable generators that offered superior performance and features. The Company\u2019s success through the years has been built upon engineering expertise, manufacturing excellence and our innovative approaches to the market. This has driven our growth into becoming a leading provider of power equipment for a variety of applications within residential, commercial, and industrial markets. \u00a0 In 1980, we expanded beyond portable generators into the industrial power generation market with the introduction of our first stationary generators that provided up to 200kW of power output. We introduced our first residential standby generator in 1989 and expanded our industrial product offering and global distribution system in the 1990s, forming a series of alliances that rapidly increased our sales. Our growth accelerated in the 2000\u2019s as we expanded our purpose-built line of residential & commercial automatic standby generators and implemented our multi-layered, omni-channel distribution philosophy. Throughout the 2000\u2019s, a number of high-profile power outage events also helped to increase the awareness and need for back-up power and home standby generators. In 2006, the founder of Generac sold the company to affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC, together with certain other investors and members of our management. In February 2010, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of our common stock. Since then, we have scaled our sales & marketing capabilities and systems, while also building the Generac brand into one of the leading names in back-up power around the nation. \u00a0 Soon after going public, we implemented our \u201cPowering Ahead\u201d enterprise strategy. This strategic plan accelerated the Company\u2019s transition from primarily a North America focused, emergency backup generator company into a more diversified industrial technology company with the addition of new and adjacent product categories and an expanded global presence, primarily through a series of acquisitions. In 2018, we transitioned into a new enterprise strategy called \u201cPowering Our Future\u201d, which drove further share gains in new and existing markets, capitalized on Generac\u2019s leadership in natural gas gensets, established our connectivity strategy, and provided the initial foundation for the Company\u2019s evolution into an energy technology solutions company, including key initial acquisitions within the residential clean energy space. This ultimately led to the introduction of our \u201cPowering A Smarter World\u201d enterprise strategy in 2021.\u00a0This current strategic plan continues the evolution of Generac\u2019s business model that pairs traditional and emerging power generation and storage technologies with new monitoring, management and grid services capabilities to provide solutions for the dynamic challenges presented by today\u2019s energy landscape. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       2\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       2\n     \n\n \n\n       2\n     \n \n       2\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 \n    \u00a0\n   Significant Investments in Energy Technology Solutions \u00a0 We\u2019ve been providing power generation and resiliency solutions for homes and businesses for decades. Leveraging that expertise in power generation, Generac has made significant investments in recent years to expand its capabilities into energy technology solutions, beginning with the March 2019 acquisition of Neurio Technology Inc., a leading energy data company focused on monitoring\u00a0technology and sophisticated analytics to optimize energy use within a home or business. This was followed by the April 2019 acquisition of Pika Energy Inc., a designer and manufacturer of battery storage technologies that capture and store solar or other power sources for homeowners and businesses. In October 2020, the Company acquired Enbala Power Networks Inc., one of the leading providers of distributed energy optimization and control software that helps support the operational stability of the world\u2019s power grids. In July 2021, Generac added to its residential clean energy portfolio with the acquisition of Chilicon Power LLC, a designer and provider of grid-interactive rooftop power inversion devices and monitoring solutions for the solar market.\u00a0With these acquisitions, Generac has established an important\u00a0presence in the rapidly growing residential clean energy market, focused on solar, battery storage and grid services applications. \u00a0 In December 2021, Generac acquired ecobee Inc., a leader in sustainable home technology solutions. In addition to smart home thermostatic controls and other smart home devices, ecobee offers its customers the ability to participate in \u201cEnergy Services\u201d programs, which allow homeowners to reduce energy consumption and utility bills via intelligent HVAC controls. The acquisition represents a major step forward in the Company\u2019s efforts to provide a broader residential energy ecosystem that includes a sophisticated user interface platform to allow homeowners to take charge of their energy generation, storage, consumption, and management through a \u201csingle pane of glass\u201d with the ultimate goal of creating a more sustainable energy infrastructure that is increasingly decarbonized, digitized and decentralized. \u00a0 As we look to the future, we expect to make continued investment in the people, processes and capabilities involved in the development of these residential clean energy technologies,\u00a0as we work to further broaden our product offering and distribution network. In 2022, we built out our energy technology management team that brings decades of industry leadership experience as well as robust technical expertise. Under this new leadership team, we expect to fully integrate our energy technology investments under a common strategy that we believe will help accelerate growth in the future. Additionally, the policy backdrop for these growing markets, underscored by the Inflation Reduction Act and other state regulations, provides the necessary potential for long-term, value-creating investments. With this opportunity in front of us, we plan to build out our residential energy technology capabilities and our suite of products & solutions as we expect to play an important role in the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable, and more reliable electric grid. \u00a0 Generac\u2019s efforts in expanding its energy technology solutions also cover C&I and international markets as well. In June 2021, the Company acquired Deep Sea Electronics Limited, a UK-based designer and manufacturer of advanced controls for a range of power generation and micro-grid applications used around the world. In September 2021, Generac acquired Off Grid Energy Ltd., a UK-based designer and manufacturer of industrial-grade mobile energy storage systems serving predominantly European markets.\u00a0The Company advanced its C&I connectivity strategy with the October 2022 acquisition of Blue Pillar, an industrial internet of things (IoT) platform developer that designs, deploys, and manages industrial IoT solutions. Blue Pillar provides a foundation to build out a connectivity solution for our C&I products to further enable their use in grid services programs. Finally, in February 2023, Generac acquired REFU Storage Systems GmbH, a developer and supplier of battery storage hardware products, advanced software and platform services for the commercial and industrial market. REFU\u2019s energy storage systems will complement and enhance our current global product offerings and will further accelerate our development of new technologies as we continue to provide our commercial and industrial consumers with leading solutions for their adoption of renewable energy. These acquisitions will collectively help lay the groundwork to further advance our energy technology strategies across C&I markets around the world. \u00a0 For a complete summary of recent acquisitions, please see Note 1, \u201cDescription of Business,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \u00a0 Products and Solutions \u00a0 We design, manufacture, and distribute a broad range of energy technology products and solutions. We design and manufacture stationary, portable and mobile power generators with single-engine outputs ranging between 800W and 3,250kW.

The deployment of our residential generators in grid services applications where available can improve grid resiliency, while also offering a direct financial incentive for homeowners to participate in these grid services programs, which can help to partially offset the purchase cost of the generator over the product's lifespan. This functionality leverages our remote monitoring system for home standby generators called Mobile Link\u2122. This remote monitoring capability is a standard, WiFi-enabled feature on every home standby generator that we offer and allows our customers to check the status of their generator conveniently from their smart phone or tablet, and also provides the capability to similarly receive maintenance and service alerts. The data that is provided by this remote monitoring functionality allows us to better understand our installed base of products, while optimizing both product quality and customer satisfaction. \u00a0 Leveraging the technologies acquired in the 2019 acquisition of Pika Energy, we have developed a line of clean energy products marketed under the Generac brand and using the name PWRcell\u2122. This residential\u00a0storage solution consists of a system of batteries, an inverter, photovoltaic (PV) optimizers, power electronic controls, and other components. This system captures and stores electricity from solar panels or other power sources and helps reduce home energy costs while also protecting homes from shorter duration power outages. PWRcell can range in size from 9kWh up to 36kWh of storage capacity. Our PWRcell energy storage systems also have Smart Grid Ready capabilities, empowering homeowners to contribute to grid stability and earn an incremental return on investment by connecting to grid services programs, which can help to partially offset the purchase cost of the system over the product's lifespan. \u00a0 In 2021, we acquired ecobee, a leader in sustainable smart home solutions such as smart thermostats and a suite of home monitoring products, all designed with a focus on conservation, convenience, peace of mind and comfort. ecobee\u2019s smart home energy management devices and complementary sensors intelligently optimize heating and cooling systems, often the largest energy consuming system within a home, to deliver significant energy savings for homeowners. In addition, we are leveraging ecobee\u2019s cutting-edge technologies and software development expertise to create a user interface platform, or \u201csingle pane of glass\u201d to allow homeowners to monitor and control Generac\u2019s entire suite of products using one common interface. These capabilities will help allow the creation of a clean, efficient, and reliable smart home energy ecosystem capable of connecting to our grid services distributed energy resource management software (DERMS)\u00a0called Concerto. \u00a0 In 2022, we launched PWRmanager, the second generation of our load management controls, allowing customers to program and remotely control certain loads in a house and thereby manage battery run times from their smart phones or tablets.\u00a0We also entered the smart water heater controller market in 2021 via the acquisition of Apricity Code, an advanced engineering and product design company that has developed certain products which help homeowners reduce energy consumption and utility bills by intelligently managing the timing of a water heater\u2019s energy consumption. Through ecobee, PWRmanager and Apricity, we are expanding our suite of grid edge devices that can be deployed in grid services applications, offering increased energy savings and economic benefits to a larger segment of the population. We also added IoT propane tank monitoring solutions with the 2021 acquisition of Tank Utility to further optimize propane fuel logistics. This addition expands Generac\u2019s connectivity functionality and provides incremental value to our dealers and peace of mind to our home standby generator owners that use propane as a fuel source. The capabilities acquired via ecobee, Apricity Code, and Tank Utility, paired with our existing remote monitoring system, provide the foundation for Generac\u2019s residential connectivity strategy, which will be integral in the continued development of our smart home energy ecosystem. \u00a0 We are developing additional new Generac-branded clean energy products that we expect to bring to market as we continue to build out a broader range of residential clean energy solutions, giving our distributors access to a more diverse line up of products that can serve a variety of applications. We are developing a rooftop MLPE solution to be used in residential solar solutions that will allow Generac to participate in residential solar installations that do not include an energy storage system. Additionally, we currently anticipate launching PWRgenerator during 2023, a one-of-a-kind natural gas generator with DC output that is purpose-built to re-charge PWRcell energy storage systems. This innovative new product is more fuel-efficient and quieter than our traditional home standby generators and can enable grid independence for homeowners. \u00a0 We also provide a broad product line of portable and inverter generators that range in size from 800W to 17.5kW, and in 2022, we introduced multiple portable battery solutions that provide clean, emission-free power at the push of a button. These products serve as an emergency home backup source of electricity and are also used for construction and recreational purposes. Our portable generators are targeted at homeowners, with price points ranging between the consumer value end of the market through the premium homeowner market; at professional contractors, starting at the value end through the premium contractor segment; and at the recreational market with our inverter generator products, which are quieter than traditional portable generators. In addition, we offer manual transfer switches to supplement our portable generator product offering. \u00a0 We provide a broad product line of outdoor power equipment referred to as chore products, which are used in property maintenance applications for larger-acreage residences, commercial properties, municipalities, and farms. These products include trimmers, field and brush mowers, log splitters, stump grinders, chipper shredders, lawn and leaf vacuums, pressure washers and water pumps. We also offer commercial-grade, battery-powered turf care products through Mean Green Products, which was acquired in 2020. In addition to Generac\u2019s efforts to expand Mean Green\u2019s production capacity and distribution capabilities, this acquisition will help to accelerate the electrification of our higher-powered lineup of chore products. Chore products are largely sold in North America through direct-to-consumer online catalogs, retail hardware stores, and outdoor power equipment dealers primarily under the DR\u00ae brand name. \u00a0 Residential products comprised 63.8%, 65.8% and 62.6%, respectively, of total net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020.  \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       4\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       4\n     \n\n \n\n       4\n     \n \n       4\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Commercial & Industrial\u00a0Products \u00a0 We offer a full line of C&I generators that are sold around the world. We are a leader in cleaner-burning natural gas fueled generators, and also have a full offering of C&I generators that are fueled by diesel and Bi-FuelTM. We believe we have one of the broadest product offerings in the industry with power outputs ranging from 10kW up to 3,250kW. Through the Deep Sea acquisition in 2021, we have expanded our capabilities in the design and manufacture of advanced controls for a range of C&I power generation applications, such as microgrids and Energy-as-a-Service. Our natural gas C&I stationary generators have Smart Grid Ready capabilities, enabling our customers to contribute to grid resiliency and generate an incremental return on investment by connecting and enrolling their generator as a distributed energy resource used in grid services applications where available. \u00a0 Our light-commercial standby generators and related transfer switches include a full range of affordable systems from 22kW to 150kW, providing three-phase power sufficient for most small and mid-sized businesses such as grocery stores, convenience stores, restaurants, gas stations, pharmacies, retail banks, small health care facilities and other small-footprint retail applications. Our light-commercial generators predominantly run on\u00a0natural gas and liquid propane. \u00a0 We design and manufacture a broad product line of modelized and configured stationary generators and related transfer switches for various industrial standby, continuous-duty, and prime rated applications. Our single-engine industrial generators range in output from 10kW up to 3,250kW, include stationary and containerized packages, and can include our Modular Power Systems (MPS) technology that extends our product range up to much larger multi-megawatt systems through an integrated paralleling configuration. Over the past several years, we have introduced larger and higher-powered gaseous-fueled generators, with the highest output of 1,000kW for a single-engine set. Our industrial standby generators are primarily used as emergency backup for larger applications in the healthcare, telecom, datacom, commercial office, retail, municipal and manufacturing markets. In recent years, we've focused our efforts to utilize our gaseous-fueled generators in \"beyond standby\" applications including distributed generation and microgrid projects and have developed purpose-built products for these applications that have grid-connected capability. The addition of Smart Grid Ready functionality and the significant expansion of our in-house advanced controls capabilities further enhances the potential utilization of our generators in these applications. \u00a0 Our MPS technology combines the power of several smaller generators to produce the output of a larger generator, providing our customers with redundancy and scalability in a cost-effective manner. For larger industrial applications, our MPS products offer customers an efficient, affordable way to scale their standby power needs, while offering superior reliability given their built-in redundancy which allows individual units to be taken off-line for routine maintenance while retaining coverage for critical circuits. \u00a0 We also offer a full line of industrial transfer switches to meet varying needs from light industrial applications all the way up to the most demanding critical installations. Over the last couple of years, we have significantly increased and upgraded our industrial transfer switch product offering, which we believe will help to enhance our attachment rate and related market share for these products. Generac\u2019s innovative feature set and flexible platforms offer a variety of switching technologies for customized solutions to meet any project needs. \u00a0 We also provide a broad product line of C&I mobile products such as light towers, mobile generators, and mobile energy storage systems, which provide temporary lighting and power for various end markets, such as road and commercial construction, energy, mining, military, and special events. We also manufacture commercial mobile pumps and dust-suppression equipment for a wide variety of applications. These mobile products are typically sold to national and regional rental companies who then rent the equipment to the end user. \u00a0 As we advance further into energy technology for C&I applications, we believe the acquisitions of Off Grid Energy in 2021 and REFU Storage Systems in February 2023 will enable us to capture share of the rapidly expanding Battery Energy Storage System (or BESS) market in the future. We will also continue to develop other energy technology products, such as hybrid mobile solutions that pair an energy storage system with a diesel generator to reduce emissions and noise pollution, as well as mobile battery-powered light towers. We will also continue to sell various gaseous-engine control systems and accessories, which are sold to gas-engine manufacturers and aftermarket customers. \u00a0 C&I products comprised 27.6%, 26.7% and 28.3%, respectively, of total net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020.  \u00a0 \n\n     5\n   \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n     5\n    \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Other Products and Services \u00a0 Our \u201cOther Products and Services\u201d category primarily consists of aftermarket service parts and product accessories sold to our customers, installation and maintenance services, extended warranty revenue, grid services revenue paid by utilities, remote monitoring subscription revenue, and other service offerings provided by our owned industrial distributors. \u00a0 Included in this \u201cOther Products and Services\u201d category are revenues from Generac Grid Services (GGS), which was formed in September 2021 and builds upon our 2020\u00a0Enbala acquisition. The formation of GGS formalized our efforts in the market for grid services by creating a focused team that collaborates across the enterprise to sell turn-key hardware and software solutions used by utilities and grid operators that enable the connection of DERs to help support the operational stability of the world\u2019s power grids. Generac\u2019s Concerto energy-balancing software platform provides a highly flexible approach for creating controllable and dispatchable energy resources from flexible loads, energy storage and renewable energy and gives utilities and grid operators the flexibility to operate virtual power plants in real-time to better manage the escalating complexities of increasingly variable energy assets. The Concerto software platform also enables Generac to enter into performance contracts, in which the Company recruits, aggregates, and manages a fleet of DERs with the purpose of efficiently managing and monetizing power capacity to utilities and grid operators. \u00a0 The acquisition of ecobee further enhanced our efforts in grid services. In addition to smart home energy management product sales, ecobee recognizes service revenue resulting from the value its platform provides in connecting its devices to grid services programs, enabling direct monitoring and control of a significant portion of the home\u2019s electrical load.

In addition to connectivity device sales, Blue Pillar recognizes software and support revenue resulting from the monitoring and management capabilities its platform provides customers.\u00a0Our Mobile Link subscription service provides this same service for our residential home standby customers, whereby we collect subscription revenue for this remote monitoring service. \u00a0 Other products and services comprised 8.6%, 7.5% and 9.1%, respectively, of total net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020.  \u00a0 Mega-Trends, Strategic Growth Themes, and Additional Business Drivers \u00a0 In 2021, we unveiled our \u201cPowering A Smarter World\u201d strategic plan, which serves as the framework for the significant investments we have made and will continue to make to capitalize on the long-term growth prospects of Generac. Our enterprise strategy is\u00a0based on the combination of several key mega-trends that we believe\u00a0will drive several significant strategic growth themes for our business. \u00a0 Key Mega-Trends:  \u00a0 \u25cf \u201cGrid 2.0\u201d:\u00a0which is the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model as supply/demand imbalances are created due to the accelerating adoption of renewable energy generation and the \u201celectrification of everything\u201d in society\u2019s energy consumption. It includes the decarbonization, digitization, and decentralization of the grid and a migration toward distributed energy resources that is expected to drive demand for a variety of clean energy and grid services solutions going forward. \u25cf Impact of climate change: which includes the expectation of more volatile and severe weather driving increased power outage activity, and more global regulation accelerating renewable investments.\u00a0 \u25cf Natural gas as\u00a0an important transition fuel to\u00a0the future: as natural gas will remain in demand as a source of cleaner, reliable power generation for backup power and beyond standby applications, compared to diesel fuel.\u00a0 \u25cf Legacy infrastructure needs a major investment cycle:\u00a0to rebuild and upgrade aging networks and systems including transportation, water and power. \u25cf Telecommunications infrastructure shifting to next generation:\u00a0which involves\u00a0the \u201c5G\u201d\u00a0architecture that will enable new technologies requiring significant improvement in network uptime through backup power solutions. \u25cf Home as a Sanctuary:\u00a0in recent years, there has been a trend of more people working, shopping, entertaining, aging in place, and generally spending more time at home. As a result of this and the \u201celectrification of everything\u201d trend, homeowners are becoming increasingly sensitive to power outages due to lost productivity and functionality. These trends combined with ongoing elevated power outage activity has led to significantly increased awareness regarding the importance and need for backup power security. \u00a0 Strategic Growth Themes: \u00a0 Power quality issues continue to increase.\u00a0Power disruptions are an important driver of consumer awareness for back-up power and have historically influenced demand for generators, both in the United States and internationally. Increased frequency and duration of major power outage events, that have a broader impact beyond a localized level, increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period, which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major outage event. Energy storage systems offer similar resiliency advantages to consumers and can benefit from these same awareness drivers, at least for short duration power outages. The optional standby market for C&I power generation is also driven by power quality issues and the related need for backup power. Attitudes around climate change have shifted and undergone increased global focus, and an aging and underinvested electrical grid infrastructure remains highly vulnerable to the expectation of more volatile and severe weather. Additionally, rapid growth in renewable power sources such as solar and wind is resulting in increased intermittency of supply, further impairing the reliable supply of electricity at a time when demand is starting to increase meaningfully with the electrification of a wide range of consumer and commercial products, including transportation, HVAC systems, and other major appliances. These developments are causing a growing supply/demand imbalance for grid operators across North America, which has led to recent high-profile examples of rolling blackouts necessary to maintain grid integrity. In fact, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation has labeled significant portions of the continent as being at high risk of resource adequacy shortfalls during normal seasonal peak conditions in the 2023-2027 period due in part to these supply/demand dynamics.\u00a0Further, in California, Public Safety Power Shutoff events have occurred whereby public utilities are turning off power supply to their customers under certain circumstances to prevent their transmission equipment from starting wildfires, which we anticipate may continue in the future. Taken together, we expect these factors to continue driving increased awareness of the need for backup power and demand for Generac\u2019s products within multiple categories. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       6\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       6\n     \n\n \n\n       6\n     \n \n       6\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Home standby penetration opportunity is significant.\u00a0Many potential customers are still not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions. With only approximately5.75% penetration of the addressable market of homes in the United States (which we define as single-family detached, owner-occupied households with a home value of over $150,000, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau's 2021\u00a0American Housing Survey for the United States), we believe there are significant opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market both domestically and internationally. We believe by expanding our distribution network, continuing to develop our product lines, and targeting our marketing efforts, we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our home standby generators. Additionally, Smart Grid Ready capabilities have the potential to turn an asset previously utilized only in emergency power outage situations into a source of recurring revenue for the homeowner and a contributor to grid stability for utilities and grid operators, therefore driving incremental interest in the product category. \u00a0 Solar, storage, and energy management markets developing quickly.\u00a0We believe the electric utility landscape will undergo significant changes in the decade ahead due to rising utility rates, grid instability and power quality issues, environmental concerns, and the continuing performance and cost improvements in renewable energy and batteries. On-site power generation from renewable sources such as solar and wind, and cleaner-burning natural gas generators is projected to become more prevalent as will the need to monitor, manage, and store this power \u2013 potentially developing into a significant market opportunity. We expect to further advance our capabilities in clean energy by increasing our product development, sourcing, distribution, and marketing efforts, as we leverage our significant competencies in the residential standby generator market to augment our market position in the emerging residential solar, storage, monitoring and management markets.\u00a0Additionally, these markets are receiving an increasing level of regulatory and legislative support, most notably from the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed in 2022.\u00a0This legislation includes significant subsidies and investment tax credits for consumers and business over the coming decade and provides necessary opportunity for long-term, value-creating investments for market participants. \u00a0 Grid services and Energy-as-a-Service open new revenue streams.\u00a0We expect the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model toward decarbonized, digitized, and decentralized solutions will continue to drive the need for grid operators to access and control DERs. This will require highly intelligent software platforms that are able to optimize an increasingly complex supply and demand equation, such as our Concerto software platform. As the grid services market matures, Generac will continue to explore opportunities beyond the traditional software-as-a-service subscription model, including but not limited to the aggregation and sale of power from a fleet of DERs in performance-based contracts, wholesale power market participation, turn-key solutions that combine hardware and software with services, and other monitoring and management services. Additionally, growing interest in our C&I products across a variety of \u201cbeyond standby\u201d applications is driving an increase in demand for subscription-like models for end customers, in which Generac will partner with third parties to deliver peace of mind and resiliency solutions while also enabling contributions to grid stability with minimal upfront capital outlays. The significant advancements made in recent years in the connectivity of our products is core to these newer capabilities, which play a key role in the evolution of Generac into an energy technology solutions company. \u00a0 Natural gas generators driving strong\u00a0growth.\u00a0We believe natural gas will continue to be an important and cleaner transition fuel of the future, in comparison to diesel, as the world continues to shift towards lower emission power generation sources. Demand for natural gas generators continues to represent an increasing portion of the overall C&I market, which we believe will continue to grow at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators. We also continue to explore and expand our capabilities within new gaseous generator market opportunities, including continuous-duty, prime rated, distributed generation, demand response, microgrids and overall use as a distributed energy resource in areas where grid stability is needed. Many of these applications are made possible by our natural gas generators having Smart Grid Ready capabilities, which allows for end users to participate in available grid services programs, helping to offset the purchase price of the equipment over the product\u2019s lifespan. Expanding our natural gas product offering into larger power nodes is also a part of this growth theme in taking advantage of the continuing shift from diesel to natural gas generators. \u00a0 Rollout of 5G will require improved network reliability.\u00a0As the number of \u201cconnected\u201d devices continues to rapidly increase and wireless networks are now being considered critical infrastructure in the United States, network reliability and up-time are necessary for our increasingly connected society. This will require highly resilient cell tower sites across the network, and therefore necessitates the need for backup power sources on site at these cell towers. Generac is the leading supplier of backup power to the telecommunications market in the United States, where approximately half of all existing tower sites have yet to be hardened with backup power. As more mission-critical data is transmitted over wireless networks, we believe this penetration rate must increase considerably to maintain a higher level of reliability across the network. Increased adoption of high-speed wireless networks around the globe may lead to similar demand trends internationally as growing cell tower density and the need for onsite backup power expand the market opportunity for our international telecom\u00a0products. We have relationships with key Tier 1 carriers and tower companies globally in addition to having the distribution partners to support the global market from a service standpoint. We believe these factors coupled with Generac\u2019s ability to customize solutions to each customer\u2019s needs help us to maintain our strength within the global telecommunications market. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n       7\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n       7\n     \n\n \n\n       7\n     \n \n       7\n      \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \u00a0 Other Business Drivers \u00a0 Impact of residential investment cycle.\u00a0The market for a number of our residential products is affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment.\u00a0When homeowners are confident of their household income, the value of their home and overall net worth, they are more likely to invest in their home. These trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators and energy storage systems. Trends in the new housing market, highlighted by residential housing starts, can also impact demand for these products. Demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors, as well as weather patterns.\u00a0Finally, the existence of renewable energy mandates, investment tax credits and other subsidies, which have become even more prevalent with the recent passing of the Inflation Reduction Act, can also have an impact on the demand for solar and energy storage systems.\u00a0 \u00a0 Impact of business capital investment and other economic cycles.\u00a0The global market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by different capital investment cycles, which can vary across the numerous regions around the world in which we participate.

These global electrification trends will require utilities and energy retailers to meaningfully increase the supply and reliability of electricity, while at the same time working to achieve carbon-reduction goals, which is expected to further contribute to a supply/demand imbalance and additional power quality issues. As part of our expanding ecosystems of energy technology solutions, we continue to build out our residential monitoring and management capabilities, which improve energy efficiency and optimize consumption by end users.\u00a0This includes ecobee\u2019s smart home energy management devices, Apricity\u2019s water heater controllers, Tank Utility\u2019s propane tank monitoring solutions, and PWRmanager, our second-generation load control device. In the future, we expect to simplify and integrate our residential product offering into a single ecosystem, leveraging our software development capabilities and the substantial resources brought by the ecobee acquisition. This singular system-level platform is intended to serve as the user interface for consumers to monitor and manage all\u00a0their DERs, thereby empowering the user to optimize energy efficiency and consumption. Within our global C&I products, we are developing bi-directional natural gas generators and system-level micro-grid controls.\u00a0In addition, Blue Pillar\u2019s Industrial IoT network software solutions enable distributed energy generation monitoring and control, helping businesses to better optimize their energy efficiency and consumption. These enhanced connectivity capabilities provide the foundation for the future build out of a centralized system-level platform for our C&I customers to monitor and manage all of their DERs. \u00a0 Protect and build critical infrastructure. Offering innovative solutions that enable and protect next-generation power, communications, transportation and other critical infrastructure. \u00a0 The critical power infrastructure around the world is becoming more sensitive to the growing electricity supply/demand imbalance. Generac\u2019s suite of solutions can be connected and synchronized within the Concerto distributed energy resource management system, providing utilities and grid operators the flexibility to access and control these DERs in real-time to better manage the escalating complexities of their electrical grids.\u00a0When utilized in these applications, our residential and C&I ecosystems of DERs essentially provide power capacity to utilities and grid operators, enabling the adoption of renewable energy sources by helping solve the intermittency challenges presented by renewable power generation. We believe the next generation of critical power infrastructure will be more decarbonized, digitized and decentralized, and we view the implementation, aggregation and management of distributed energy resources as an important aspect in creating the future \u201cGrid 2.0\u201d. Additionally, the rollout of 5G telecom networks globally and the growing consideration of these wireless networks as critical infrastructure makes our backup power solutions for telecommunications applications essential elements of a wireless network that cannot afford to experience power failure. Finally, our broad offering of global mobile solutions, including mobile power generators, mobile energy storage systems and hybrid generators, play a key role in the completion of infrastructure construction projects, such as roads, highways, bridges, and airports. \u00a0 See \u201cItem 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Business Drivers and Operational Factors\u201d for additional drivers that influence demand for our products and other factors affecting the markets that we serve. \u00a0 Distribution Channels and Customers \u00a0 We distribute our products through a variety of different distribution channels to increase awareness of our product categories and brands, and to ensure our products reach a broad, global customer base.
