Garmin\u2019s products are created by its engineering and development staff. Garmin\u2019s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin\u2019s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin\u2019s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, and cartographic engineers. Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin\u2019s success. \u00a0 Manufacturing and Operations  \u00a0 Garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its Taiwan facilities in Xizhi, Jhongli, LinKou, and Xinshi, its China facility in Yangzhou, its Netherlands facility in Oegstgeest, its Poland facility in Wroclaw, and at its U.S. facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon. Garmin believes that its operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets. \u00a0 Specifically, Garmin believes that the vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost, quality, and time to market.  \u00a0 Cost: Garmin\u2019s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs, concepts, products and processes, achieving higher efficiency and resulting in lower cost. Garmin\u2019s vertical integration approach enables leveraging of manufacturing resources across high, mid, and low volume products. Sharing of these resources across product lines favorably affects Garmin\u2019s costs to produce its range of products, with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of higher volume products. The ownership and integration of its resources allows Garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of its products, yielding improved cost.  \u00a0 Quality: Garmin\u2019s automation and advanced production processes provide in-service robustness and consistent reliability standards that enable Garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured, thereby improving the overall quality of our products. Additionally, the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is shared with the development teams, providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain. \u00a0 Garmin\u2019s design, manufacturing, distribution, and service functions in its U.S., Taiwan, China, and U.K. facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Garmin\u2019s automotive operations in Taiwan, China, U.K., and Olathe have achieved IATF 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers. Garmin\u2019s Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon aviation operations in the U.S. have achieved certification to AS9100, a quality standard for the aviation industry. Garmin has also implemented multiple health and safety management systems and achieved certification to the ISO 45001 standard for Health and Safety Management at facilities in the U.S., Taiwan, Poland, and China. \u00a0 Time to Market: Garmin uses multi-disciplinary teams of design engineers, process engineers, and supply chain specialists to develop products, allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing. This integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market.  \u00a0 Materials \u00a0 Garmin purchases components from a large number of qualified suppliers. Although many components essential to Garmin\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other suppliers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. While extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to meet customer demand due to component shortages or increased lead times, or cause us to incur higher product costs, we believe these potential disruptions would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors.  \u00a0 11 Seasonality \u00a0 Our net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Sales of our fitness and outdoor products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season. Sales of our marine and consumer auto products are generally higher in the second quarter. Sales in these segments are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products. Our aviation and auto OEM products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications, regulatory mandates, auto program manufacturing, and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest. \u00a0 Intellectual Property  \u00a0 Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.  \u00a0 As of January 5, 2023, Garmin has been issued over 1,800 patents throughout the world and holds more than 1,080 trademark registrations. The duration of patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law. We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate. Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin\u2019s rights in its proprietary technologies.  \u00a0 There is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. \u00a0 Environmental Matters  \u00a0 Garmin\u2019s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes. Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. Capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget. Historically, capital expenditures associated with environmental controls have not been material and compliance with environmental laws has not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s competitive position.  \u00a0 Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency. Garmin is also subject to extended producer responsibility laws and regulations requiring manufacturers to be responsible for collection, recovery, and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products. Historically, compliance with environmental laws has not had a material impact on our profitability. We have processes to monitor environmental law changes and to evaluate the potential impact of such laws to our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial. \u00a0 Garmin has a global environmental policy and is committed to working to protect the environment throughout various aspects of our business. Garmin has implemented multiple environmental management systems and achieved certification to the ISO 14001 standard for Environmental Management at facilities in the U.S., U.K., Taiwan, Poland, and China.  \u00a0 Garmin strives to reduce our environmental impact by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts. Garmin is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through direct carbon emissions reduction and elimination strategies. Garmin has several locations that utilize renewable electricity, including facilities in Olathe, Kansas. Garmin also has made efforts to reduce waste and increase recycling and composting. \u00a0 12 Human Capital  \u00a0 Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing, and retaining key employees and members of our management team. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to provide opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by generous compensation and benefits, and through programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.  \u00a0 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 19,700 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom approximately 6,600 were in the Americas region, 10,500 were in APAC (Asia Pacific and Australian Continent), and 2,600 were in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa). Garmin\u2019s vertical integration model enables us to provide a variety of opportunities across many different professions including engineering, human resources, information technology, marketing, sales, and operations. The Company\u2019s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered approximately 5,500 people worldwide as of December 31, 2022. Garmin\u2019s manufacturing staff, which numbered approximately 8,900 people worldwide as of December 31, 2022, includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin\u2019s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. \u00a0 Garmin respects the right of all employees to form and join an association to represent their interests as employees, to organize, and to bargain collectively or individually. We also respect any employee\u2019s choice to refrain from joining a union. Except for some of Garmin\u2019s employees in Sweden, none of Garmin\u2019s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, as evidenced by a strong company culture and positive relations between the Company and our employees. \u00a0 We offer a range of generous benefits to our employees that enable us to attract and retain leading talent. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include stock compensation, savings plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which provides employees an opportunity to acquire company ownership for a discounted price. We also invest significant resources in our talent development programs to provide employees with the training and education they need to help achieve their career goals, build relevant skills, and lead their organizations. Employee Resource Groups provide opportunities for employees to connect, network, and become involved in community engagement initiatives.  \u00a0 We support local community engagement initiatives where we have a business presence, and we provide opportunities for employees to give back to those communities. One such initiative is through active engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (\u201cSTEM\u201d) community outreach programs. Our strategic aim in these educational programs is to educate and encourage local students to pursue careers in the engineering field, especially students in underrepresented groups, which we believe benefits not only our company but the overall industry. \u00a0 13", "time": "00:00:03"}
