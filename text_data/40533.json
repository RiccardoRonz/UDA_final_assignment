BUSINESS (Dollars in millions, except per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)  BUSINESS OVERVIEW General Dynamics is a global aerospace and defense company that specializes in high-end design, engineering and manufacturing to deliver state-of-the-art solutions to our customers. We offer a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; ship construction and repair; land combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; and technology products and services. Our leadership positions in attractive business aviation and defense markets enable us to deliver superior and enduring shareholder returns. Our company consists of 10 business units, which are organized into four operating segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies. We refer to the latter three collectively as our defense segments. To optimize market focus, customer intimacy, agility and operating expertise, each business unit is responsible for the development and execution of its strategy and operating results. This structure allows for a lean corporate function, which sets the overall strategy and governance for the company and is responsible for allocating and deploying capital. Our business units seek to deliver superior operating results by building industry-leading franchises. To achieve this goal, we invest in advanced technologies, pursue a culture of continuous improvement, and strive to be the low-cost, high-quality provider in each of our markets. The result is long-term value creation measured by strong earnings and cash flow and an attractive return on capital. Over the past 10 years, we have invested in our business to create, renew or expand our portfolio of products and services across our businesses. This includes product development investments in Aerospace to bring to market an all-new lineup of business jet aircraft, capital investments in Marine Systems to support significant growth in U.S. Navy ship and submarine construction plans over the next two decades, development of next-generation platforms and technologies to meet customers\u2019 emerging requirements in Combat Systems, and strategic acquisitions to achieve critical mass and build out a complete spectrum of solutions for our Technologies customers. As we emerge from this period of significant investment, we expect to realize an attractive return from these investments in each of our segments and continue to evaluate our capital deployment opportunities to deliver long-term growth and enduring value to our shareholders. Following is additional information on each of our operating segments. For a supplemental discussion of segment performance and backlog, see Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7. AEROSPACE Our Aerospace segment is recognized as a leading producer of business jets and the standard bearer in new technology aircraft, aircraft repair, support and completion services. The segment consists of our Gulfstream and Jet Aviation business units. We have earned our reputation through: \u2022superior aircraft design, quality, performance, safety and reliability; \u2022technologically advanced flight deck and cabin systems; and \u2022industry-leading customer support. 3 3 3   We believe the key to long-term value creation in the business jet industry is steady investment in new aircraft models and technologies and in customer service capabilities. As a result, since we acquired Gulfstream more than 20 years ago, we have made significant investments in research and development (R&D), state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and maintenance and support through a combination of product development efforts, capital expansion and the acquisition of Jet Aviation\u2019s global support network. We are also the industry leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and energy efficient engines. We are committed to continual investment in R&D to create new aircraft that consistently broaden customer offerings while raising the bar for safety and performance. The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. The Gulfstream family of aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes. The following represents Gulfstream\u2019s current product line, along with the maximum range, maximum speed, cabin length (excluding baggage), and total number of city-pair speed records held for each aircraft:   The most recent additions to the in-service Gulfstream fleet are two large-cabin aircraft, the G500 and G600, which entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These clean-sheet (i.e., all-new) aircraft replace the G450 and G550 models, whose combined family has an installed base of more than  4 4 4   1,650 aircraft around the world. Our investment included development of a new wing, new avionics, new fuselage and new ergonomically designed larger interiors, as well as systems and technologies to improve the manufacturing process and quality of the platform. As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, more fuel efficient, and have greater cabin volume, reduced emissions, more range and improved flight controls compared with the aircraft they are replacing. These aircraft hold more than 90 city-pair speed records, and at year-end 2022, cumulative deliveries for the aircraft totaled over 200. The next model to join the Gulfstream lineup is the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700. It combines our most spacious cabin with our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck, the industry\u2019s most technologically advanced flight deck, which we launched on our G500 and G600 aircraft, and the superior high-speed performance of all-new engines to create best-in-class capabilities. Gulfstream is in the process of flight testing and seeking U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification of the G700, which currently has logged more than 3,200 test hours. We expect the G700 to enter service following certification from the FAA in the summer of 2023. In 2021, we introduced two new aircraft, the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G800 and large-cabin G400, completing a nearly two-decade effort to develop an all-new family of Gulfstream aircraft. Both aircraft combine our industry-leading high-speed range and efficiency, safety enhancements, and our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck. The G800 is Gulfstream\u2019s longest-range aircraft, with an 8,000 nautical mile range at Mach 0.85, and it is expected to enter service approximately six months after the G700, pending FAA certification. The G400 is a clean-sheet design developed in concert with the G500 and G600, thus expanding the commonality across the Gulfstream family of aircraft. Expected to enter service in 2025, pending FAA certification, the G400 will join a market segment in which Gulfstream has not participated for several decades. The ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G650 and G650ER continue to generate significant customer interest, with more than 500 aircraft of this family currently operating in more than 50 countries. Since the first G650 entered service in December 2012, its capabilities and reliability have led to significant sales and expansion of our installed base around the globe. Gulfstream\u2019s current product line holds more than 325 city-pair speed records, more than any other business jet manufacturer, led by the G650ER, which holds the National Aeronautic Association\u2019s polar and westbound around-the-world speed records.  Our disciplined and consistent approach to new product development has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-market capabilities that set industry standards for safety, performance, quality, speed and comfort. Product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, composites, flight-control and vision systems, acoustics, and cabin technologies. Gulfstream designs, develops and manufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including all large-cabin models. The mid-cabin G280 is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in Gulfstream\u2019s U.S. facilities. As Gulfstream\u2019s aircraft portfolio and customer base have grown and become increasingly global in reach over the years, we have invested in our facilities and operations around the world. At our Savannah campus, we added new purpose-built manufacturing facilities, increased aircraft service capacity, opened a customer-support distribution center and expanded our R&D capabilities.

Revenue by major products and services was as follows: Year Ended December 31202220212020IT services$8,195\u00a0$8,069\u00a0$7,892\u00a0C5ISR solutions4,297\u00a04,388\u00a04,756\u00a0Total Technologies$12,492\u00a0$12,457\u00a0$12,648\u00a0  CUSTOMERS In 2022, 70% of our consolidated revenue was from the U.S. government, 15% was from U.S. commercial customers, 9% was from non-U.S. government customers and the remaining 6% was from non-U.S. commercial customers. U.S. GOVERNMENT Our primary customer is the DoD. We also contract with other U.S. government customers, including the intelligence community and the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. Our revenue from the U.S. government was as follows: 15 15 15   Year Ended December 31202220212020DoD$22,250\u00a0$21,386\u00a0$20,840\u00a0Non-DoD4,808\u00a04,862\u00a04,726\u00a0Foreign military sales (FMS)*633\u00a0598\u00a0737\u00a0Total U.S. government$27,691\u00a0$26,846\u00a0$26,303\u00a0% of total revenue70\u00a0%70\u00a0%69\u00a0% *In addition to our direct non-U.S. sales, we sell to non-U.S. governments through the FMS program. Under the FMS program, we contract with and are paid by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government assumes the risk of collection from the non-U.S. government customer. Our U.S. government revenue is derived from fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Our production contracts are primarily fixed-price. Under these contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount. Contracts for research, engineering, repair and maintenance, and other services are typically cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs incurred and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. The amount for an incentive or award fee is determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials. Of our U.S. government revenue, fixed-price contracts accounted for 56% in 2022, 57% in 2021 and 59% in 2020; cost-reimbursement contracts accounted for 38% in 2022, 36% in 2021 and 35% in 2020; and time-and-materials contracts accounted for 6% in 2022, 7% in 2021 and 6% in 2020. For information on the advantages and disadvantages of each of these contract types, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  U.S. COMMERCIAL Our U.S. commercial revenue was $5.7\u00a0billion in 2022, $4.8 billion in 2021 and $4.9 billion in 2020, which represented 15%, 12% and 13% of our consolidated revenue in each of the respective years. The majority of this revenue was for business jet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries.  NON-U.S. Our revenue from non-U.S. government and commercial customers was $6\u00a0billion in 2022, $6.8 billion in 2021 and $6.7 billion in 2020, which represented 15% of our consolidated revenue in 2022 and 18% in 2021 and 2020. We conduct business with customers around the world. Our non-U.S. defense subsidiaries maintain long-term relationships with their customers and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers, providing a broad portfolio of products and services. Our non-U.S. commercial revenue consists primarily of business jet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services. While the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in North America, orders from customers outside North America represent a significant portion of our aircraft business with approximately 40% of the Aerospace segment\u2019s aircraft backlog on December\u00a031, 2022.  16 16 16   COMPETITION Several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and business aviation markets. While customers\u2019 evaluation criteria vary, the principal competitive elements include: \u2022the technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services; \u2022our ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats; \u2022successful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems; \u2022our global footprint and accessibility to customers; \u2022the reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; and \u2022the successful management of customer relationships. DEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION The U.S. government contracts with numerous domestic and non-U.S. companies for products and services. We compete against other contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability. Outside the United States, we compete with global defense contractors\u2019 exports and the offerings of local, private and state-owned defense manufacturers. Our Marine Systems segment has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the Virginia-class submarine program, and to which it subcontracts on the Columbia-class submarine program. Our Combat Systems segment competes with a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. businesses. Our Technologies segment competes with many companies, from large government contracting and commercial technology companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise. The operating cycle of many of our major programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully. We are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors. Competitions for major defense and other government contracting programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer\u2019s requirements. Opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program\u2019s integrator, overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team, or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem. BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT MARKET COMPETITION The Aerospace segment has several competitors for each of its Gulfstream products. Key competitive factors include aircraft safety, reliability and performance; comfort and in-flight productivity; service quality, global footprint and responsiveness; technological and new-product innovation; and price. We believe that Gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas. The Aerospace segment competes worldwide in the business jet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of quality, price and timeliness. While competition for each type of service varies somewhat, the segment faces a number of competitors of varying sizes for each of its offerings.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We develop technology, manufacturing processes and systems-integration practices. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to and from others. The U.S. government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the  17 17 17   performance of U.S. government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents. Although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business, no existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business.  HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Our company is a global community of approximately 106,500 employees dedicated to our Ethos of transparency, trust, honesty and alignment. These four core values drive how we operate our business; govern how we interact with each other, our customers, partners and suppliers; guide the way that we treat our workforce; and determine how we connect with our communities. Our commitment to ethical business practices is outlined in our Standards of Business Ethics and Conduct, which states our expectation that all employees conduct business in accordance with our Ethos, applicable laws and our policies. Each employee is asked to acknowledge receipt, understanding of and compliance with our standards. Due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and train skilled and qualified people to design and build the products and perform the services required by our customers. The health, welfare and safety of our employees is paramount throughout our workplaces. This effort starts with treating all employees with dignity and respect and providing them with fair, market-based, competitive and equitable compensation. We recognize and reward the performance of our employees in line with our pay-for-performance philosophy and provide a comprehensive suite of benefit options that aim to enable our employees and their dependents to live healthy and productive lives. Across our businesses, we take measures to prevent workplace hazards, encourage safe behaviors and enforce a culture of continuous improvement to ensure our processes help reduce safety incidents and illnesses and comply with applicable health and safety laws. These efforts continue to be of the utmost importance as we address ongoing challenges, including those presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognize that our success as a company depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified people. Our commitment to promoting diversity of thought, experience, perspectives, backgrounds and capabilities to drive innovation strengthens the solutions we deliver to our customers. General Dynamics works hard to promote an environment that values and supports all employees. We proudly support a work environment that respects diverse opinions, values individual skills, celebrates unique experiences and cultivates teamwork. These efforts are a demonstration of our dedication to equal employment opportunities that foster and support a principled, productive and inclusive work environment. We stand for basic universal human rights, including that employment must be voluntary. We track, measure and analyze our workforce trends to establish accountability for putting people first across our businesses and at every level of our company. Our values motivate us to promote strong workplace practices with opportunities for development and training. Our training and development efforts focus on ensuring that our people are appropriately trained on critical job skills as well as on leadership behaviors that are consistent with our Ethos. We conduct rigorous succession planning exercises to ensure that key positions have the appropriate level of bench strength to provide for future key positions and leadership transitions. We listen to our people to assess areas of concern and levels of engagement. 18 18 18   2022 WORKFORCE STATISTICS \u2022Approximately 84% of our employees are based in the United States, of which roughly 71% are white, 29% are people of color, 19% are veterans of the U.S. armed forces and 7% have self-reported having a disability. The remaining 16% of our workforce is based internationally in over 65 countries with the primary concentrations being in North America and Europe. \u2022Our global workforce is 76% male and 24% female, and our senior leadership teams across the business are represented by 74% males and 26% females. During 2022, the diversity profile of our workforce continued to improve across our businesses, as we hired approximately 24,000 individuals of which 71% were male and 29% were female. For our approximately 19,800 U.S.-based hires in 2022, 60% were white and 40% were people of color.  RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS We depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials, components and subsystems. Our U.S. government customer is a supplier for some of our programs. These supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints, which can put pressure on our costs. Effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance. If our sources of supply are disrupted, particularly in instances where we rely on only one or two sources of supply, or in the event that international conflicts result in the disruption of manufacturing or trade relations for some supply components, our ability to meet our customer commitments could be adversely impacted. We attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into long-term agreements and leveraging company-wide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts.  REGULATORY MATTERS U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS U.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) govern the majority of our contracts. The FAR mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. government acquisitions and purchased services. Also, individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR. For example, the DoD implements the FAR through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). For all federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including: \u2022acquisition planning; \u2022competition requirements; \u2022contractor qualifications; \u2022protection of source selection and supplier information; and \u2022acquisition procedures. In addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts. 19 19 19   NON-U.S. REGULATORY Our non-U.S. operations are subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control. BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT The Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness. Aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority, which is often accomplished through a supplemental type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well. ENVIRONMENTAL We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency. As a PRP, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination. In cases where we have been designated a PRP, we generally seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate cost-recovery actions. In the unlikely event that we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other PRPs. We regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters. Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. Historically, these costs have not been material. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, the timing and effect of which are difficult to assess. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs or facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs. Environmental costs are often recoverable under our contracts with the U.S. government. Based on information currently available and current U.S. government policies relating to cost recovery, we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations, including costs associated with changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters, see Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  20 20 20   AVAILABLE INFORMATION We file reports and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to Section\u00a013(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
