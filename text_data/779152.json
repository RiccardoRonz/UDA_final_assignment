{"cik": 779152, "item_1A": "ITEM 1. \u00a0BUSINESS Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\u00ae is a well-rounded financial technology company that strengthens connections between financial institutions and the people and businesses they serve. For more than 47 years, we have provided technology solutions to help banks and credit unions innovate faster, strategically differentiate, and successfully compete while serving the evolving needs of their accountholders. We empower over 7,500 financial institutions and diverse corporate entities with people-inspired innovation, personal service, and insight-driven solutions that help reduce the barriers to financial health.   Mission Statement  We strengthen the connections between people and their financial institutions through technology and services that reduce the barriers to financial health.  This philosophy has always been part of our foundation and the roots on which Jack Henry was built. Our founders, Jack Henry and Jerry Hall, were committed to their community and believed they could help financial institutions better serve the needs of people and businesses using more modern technology and services.   While much has changed since we opened for business in 1976, we continue to be focused on helping community and regional financial institutions, and we are guided by our founding principles: do the right thing, do whatever it takes, and have fun.  Who We Serve  We provide products and services primarily to community and regional financial institutions: \u2022Core bank integrated data processing systems are provided to 940 banks ranging from de novo to multi-billion-dollar institutions with assets of up to $50 billion. The number of banks we serve has decreased in the last year due to acquisitions and mergers within the banking industry, which are discussed further under the heading \"Our Industry\" in this Item 1. Our banking solutions support both on-premise and private cloud operating environments with functionally distinct core processing platforms and integrated complementary solutions. \u2022Core credit union data processing solutions are provided to credit unions of all sizes, with a client base of over 710 credit union customers. We offer a flagship core processing platform and integrated complementary solutions that support both on-premise and private cloud operating environments. \u2022Non-core highly specialized core-agnostic products and services are also provided to financial institutions. We offer complementary solutions that include highly specialized financial performance, imaging and payments processing, information security and risk management, retail delivery, and online and mobile functionality. These products and services enhance the performance of traditional financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters, and non-traditional diverse corporate entities. In total, we serve over 7,500 customers, over 1,650 of our core customers included in our bank and credit union customers listed above, and nearly 5,880 non-core customers. Our products and services provide our customers with solutions that can be tailored to support their unique growth, service, operational, and performance goals. Our well-rounded solutions also enable financial institutions to offer the high-demand products and services required by their customers to compete more successfully, and to capitalize on evolving trends shaping the financial services industry. We are committed to exceeding our customers\u2019 expectations. We measure and monitor customer satisfaction using a variety of surveys, such as an annual survey on the customer's anniversary date and randomly-generated online surveys initiated each day by routine support requests to ensure feedback is received throughout the year. The results of our survey process provide assurance that our service consistently exceeds our customers\u2019 expectations and, we believe, contribute to our excellent customer retention rates. We are focused on establishing long-term customer relationships, continually expanding and strengthening those relationships with cross sales of additional products and services that support our clients' strategy, earning new financial and non-financial clients, and ensuring our product offerings are highly competitive. The majority of our revenue is derived from support and services provided by our private and public cloud services for our hosted customers that are typically on a seven-year or greater contract, recurring electronic payment solutions that are also generally on a contract term of seven years or greater, and our on-premise customers that are typically on a one-year contract. Less predictable software license fees, paid by customers implementing our  5 5 5   software solutions on-premise, and hardware sales, including all non-software products that we re-market in order to support our software systems, complement our primary revenue sources. Information regarding the classification of our business into four separate segments is set forth in Note\u00a014 to the consolidated financial statements (see Item 8). We recognize that our associates and their collective contribution are ultimately responsible for Jack Henry's past, present, and future success. Recruiting and retaining high-quality employees is essential to our ongoing growth and financial performance, and we believe we have established an organizational culture that sustains high levels of employee engagement. For further discussion of our human capital considerations, see \"Human Capital\" below. Our Industry\u00a0 Our core banking solutions serve commercial banks and savings institutions with up to $50 billion in assets. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), there were approximately 4,660 commercial banks and savings institutions in this asset range as of December\u00a031, 2022, and we currently support 940 of these banks with one of our three core information processing platforms and complementary products and services. \u00a0 Our core credit union solutions serve credit unions of all asset sizes. According to the Credit Union National Association (\u201cCUNA\u201d), there were more than 4,850 domestic credit unions as of December\u00a031, 2022, and we currently support over 710 of these credit unions with one flagship core information processing platform and complementary products and services. Our non-core solutions serve financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters and other diverse corporate entities. We currently support over 7,500 institutions with specialized solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security, mitigating operational risks, and controlling operating costs. The FDIC reports the number of commercial banks and savings institutions declined 17% from the beginning of calendar year 2017 to the end of calendar year 2022, due mainly to mergers. Although the number of banks declined at a 4% compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 6% and totaled $23.6 trillion as of December\u00a031, 2022. There were 15 new bank charters issued in calendar year 2022, compared to 10 in the 2021 calendar year. Comparing calendar years 2022 to 2021, the number of mergers decreased 19%. CUNA reports the number of credit unions declined 15% from the beginning of calendar year 2017 to the end of calendar year 2022. Although the number of credit unions declined at a 3% compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 9% and totaled $2.2 trillion as of December\u00a031, 2022. Community and mid-tier banks and credit unions are vitally important to the communities, consumers, and businesses they serve. Bank customers and credit union members rely on these institutions to provide personalized, relationship-based service and competitive financial products and services available through the customer\u2019s delivery channel of choice.  Institutions are recognizing that attracting and retaining customers and members in today\u2019s highly competitive financial industry and realizing near-term and long-term performance goals are often technology dependent. Financial institutions must implement technological solutions that enable them to: \u2022Offer e-commerce, mobile, and digital strategies that provide the convenience-driven services required in today\u2019s financial services industry. \u2022Maximize performance with accessible, accurate, and timely business intelligence information. \u2022Provide the high-demand products and services needed to successfully compete with traditional and non-traditional competitors created by convergence within the financial services industry. \u2022Enhance the customer/member experience at multiple points of contact. \u2022Expand existing customer/member relationships and strengthen exit barriers by cross selling additional products and services. \u2022Capitalize on new revenue, and deposit and loan portfolio growth opportunities. \u2022Increase operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs. \u2022Protect mission-critical information assets and operational infrastructure. \u2022Protect customers/members with various security tools from fraud and related financial losses. \u2022Maximize the day-to-day use of technology and return on technology investments. \u2022Ensure full regulatory compliance. 6 6 6   Jack Henry\u2019s extensive product and service offerings help diverse financial institutions meet business challenges and capitalize on opportunities. We strive to get to know our customers, understand their strategies and challenges, and provide innovative solutions that help them achieve short- and long-term success.  Business Strategy Our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth augmented by strategic acquisitions. We execute this strategy by: \u2022Providing community and regional banks and credit unions with core processing systems that provide excellent functionality and support on-premise and private cloud delivery environments with identical functionality. \u2022Expanding each core customer relationship by cross-selling complementary products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core processing systems. \u2022Providing non-core highly specialized core-agnostic complementary products and services to financial institutions, including institutions not utilizing one of our core processing systems, and diverse corporate entities. \u2022Developing and deploying a long-term technology modernization strategy to provide public cloud native solutions that provide clients with greater flexibility, optionality, open integration, speed to market, and other benefits. \u2022Maintaining a company-wide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers\u2019 expectations and generates high levels of customer retention. \u2022Building, maintaining, and enhancing a protected environment and tools that help our clients and us protect customer data, assets, and comply with regulations. \u2022Capitalizing on our acquisition strategy. Acquisition Strategy We have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with 35 strategic acquisitions since the end of fiscal year 1999. We continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to:  \u2022Expand our suite of complementary products and services. \u2022Provide products and services that can be sold to both existing core and non-core customers and outside our base to new customers. \u2022Accelerate our internal development efforts. \u2022Provide selective opportunities to sell outside our traditional markets in the financial services industry.  After 47 years in business, we have very few gaps in our product line, so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues. In addition, we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our Company without material distractions.  We have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint, and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction, complement and accelerate our organic growth, and generate long-term profitable growth for our stockholders. While we seek to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, we will continue to explore alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our stockholders, such as continued investment in new products and services for our customers, repurchases of our stock, and continued payment of dividends. Our most recent acquisition was: Fiscal YearCompany or Product NameProducts and Services2023Payrailz, LLC (\"Payrailz\")Provider of cloud-native modern digital payment capabilities leveraging AI and machine learning features for the financial services industry. Solutions \u2022Our core banking solutions support commercial banks with information and transaction processing platforms that provide enterprise-wide automation. We have three functionally distinct core bank processing systems and more than 140 fully integrated complementary solutions, including business intelligence and bank management, retail and business banking, digital and mobile internet banking and electronic payment solutions, fraud and risk management and protection, account origination, and item and document imaging solutions. Our core banking  7 7 7   solutions have state-of-the-art functional capabilities, and we can re-market the hardware required by on-premise use of each software system. Our banking solutions can be delivered on-premise or through our private cloud delivery model and are backed by a company-wide commitment to provide exceptional personal service.  \u2022Our core credit union solutions support credit unions of all sizes with an information and transaction processing platform that provides enterprise-wide automation. Our solution includes one flagship core processing system and more than 100 fully integrated complementary solutions, including business intelligence and credit union management, member and member business services, digital and mobile internet banking and electronic payment solutions, fraud and risk management and protection, account origination, and item and document imaging solutions. Our credit union solution also has state-of-the-art functional capabilities. We also re-market the hardware required by on-premise use of the software system. Our credit union solution can be delivered on-premise, through our private cloud, or through our partner private cloud delivery models. Each is backed by our company-wide commitment to provide exceptional personal service.  \u2022Our non-core solutions for financial institutions are specialized products and services assembled primarily through our focused diversification acquisition strategy. These core-agnostic solutions are compatible with a wide variety of information technology platforms and operating environments and offer more than 100 complementary solutions, including proven solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security and mitigating operational risks, and/or controlling operating costs. Our non-core products and services enhance the performance of financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters, and diverse corporate entities. These distinct products and services can be implemented individually or as solution suites to address specific business problems or needs and enable effective responses to dynamic industry trends. We strive to develop and maintain functionally robust, integrated solutions that are supported with high service levels, regularly updating and improving those solutions using an interactive customer enhancement process; ensuring compliance with relevant regulations; updated with proven advances in technology; and consistent with Jack Henry\u2019s reputation as a premium solution and service provider. Core Software Systems Core software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and to maintain centralized customer/member information. Our core banking solutions consist of three software systems marketed to banks and our core credit union solution consists of one software system marketed to credit unions. These core systems are available for on-premise installation at customer sites, or financial institutions can choose to leverage our private cloud environment for ongoing information processing. Core banking platforms are: \u2022SilverLake System\u00ae, a robust system primarily designed for commercial-focused banks with assets ranging from $1 billion to $50 billion. Some progressive smaller banks and de novo (start-up) banks also select SilverLake. This system is in use by over 460 banks, and now automates nearly 10% of the domestic banks with assets less than $50 billion. \u2022CIF 20/20\u00ae, a parameter-driven, easy-to-use system that now supports approximately 300 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets of $5 billion. \u2022Core Director\u00ae, a cost-efficient system with point-and-click operation that now supports approximately 180 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets of over $2 billion. Core credit union platform is: \u00a0 \u2022Symitar\u00ae (formerly known as Episys\u00ae), a robust system designed specifically for credit unions. It has been implemented by over 710 credit unions with assets ranging from $3 million to $35 billion, and according to National Credit Union Administration (\"NCUA\") data, is the system implemented by more credit unions with assets exceeding $25 million than any other alternative core system. Customers electing to install our solutions on-premise license the proprietary software systems. The majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees. We re-market the hardware, hardware maintenance, and peripheral equipment that is required by on-premise use of our software solutions; and we perform software implementation, data conversion, training, ongoing support, and other related services. On-premise customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location. Customers can eliminate the significant up-front capital expenditures required by on-premise installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by leveraging our private cloud environment for those functions. Our core private cloud services are provided through a highly resilient data center  8 8 8   configuration across multiple physical locations. We also provide image item processing services from two host/archive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country. We print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three regional printing and rendering centers. Customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for seven or more years that include \"per account\" fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period. We support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system, the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products, the ongoing integration of practical new technologies, and regulatory compliance initiatives. We also serve each core customer as a single point of contact, support, and accountability. Complementary Products and Services \u00a0 We have more than 140 complementary products and services that are targeted to our core banks and more than 100 targeted to credit union customers. Many of these are selectively sold to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems. These complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customer/member demands, expedite speed-to-market with competitive offerings, increase operating efficiency, address specific operational issues, and generate new revenue streams. The highly specialized solutions enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities, increase security and mitigate operational risks, and control operating costs. We regularly introduce new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary solutions from our existing core clients and based on the growing demand among financial services organizations and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities, mitigating and controlling operational risks, and/or containing costs. Our Industry Research department solicits customer guidance on the business solutions they need, evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings, and manages the introduction of new product offerings. Our new complementary products and services are developed internally, acquired, or provided through strategic alliances. Implementation and Training Most of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems and additional complementary products. A complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning, project management, data conversion, and testing. Our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities or work remotely with clients to help manage the implementation process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the Jack Henry system. Our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed. We also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers. We have a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education. The training enables financial institutions to maximize the use of our core and complementary solutions, learn about ongoing system enhancements, and understand dynamic year-end legislative and regulatory requirements.  Support and Services We serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide. Our comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates: \u2022Exacting service standards. \u2022Trained support staff available up to 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. \u2022Assigned account managers. \u2022Sophisticated support tools, resources, and technology. \u2022Broad experience converting diverse banks and credit unions to our core platforms from competitive platforms.  \u2022Highly effective change management and control processes. \u2022Best practices methodology developed and refined through the company-wide, day-to-day experience supporting over 7,500 diverse clients. Most on-premise customers contract for annual software support services, and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for Jack Henry. These support services are typically priced at approximately 20% of the respective product\u2019s software license fee. The subsequent years' service fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased. Annual software support fees typically are billed during June and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year, with proration for new product  9 9 9   implementations that occur during the fiscal year. Hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years. Most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or Jack Henry gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration. High levels of support are provided to our private cloud customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for on-premise customers. However, these support fees are included as part of monthly private cloud fees. Hardware Systems Our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms. We have established remarketing agreements with IBM Corporation, and many other hardware providers that allow Jack Henry to purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our customers. We currently sell IBM Power Systems\u2122; Lenovo\u00ae, Dell, Hewlett Packard, and Cisco servers and workstations; Canon\u00ae, Digital Check, Epson\u00ae, and Panini\u00ae check scanners; and other devices that complement our software solutions. Digital Products and Services Jack Henry Digital represents a category of digital products and services that are being built and integrated together into one unified platform. Our main offering is the Banno Digital Platform\u2122. It is an online and mobile banking platform that helps community and regional financial institutions strategically differentiate their digital offerings from those of megabanks and other financial technology companies. It is a complete, open digital banking platform that gives banks and credit unions attractive, fast, native applications for their customers and members and cloud-based, core-connected back-office tools for their employees. Payment Solutions Electronic payment solutions provide our customers with the tools necessary to be at the forefront of payment innovation with secure payment processing designed to simplify complex payment processing, attract profitable retail and commercial accounts, increase operating efficiencies, comply with regulatory mandates, and proactively mitigate and manage payment-related risk. \u2022JHA Card Processing Solutions\u2122 (\"CPS\") supports full-service and in-house debit and credit card programs backed by a comprehensive suite of tools for fraud mitigation, digital payments, dispute management, plastics manufacturing and personalization, loyalty programs, data analytics, and terminal driving. In addition, advisory services are offered to support a variety of needs including card portfolio growth, start-up program consultation, as well as customized fraud management; all tailored to individual financial institution goals and concerns.  \u2022Enterprise Payment Solutions (\"EPS\") is a comprehensive payments engine. It offers an integrated suite of remote deposit capture, Automated Clearing House (\"ACH\"), and card transaction processing solutions, risk management tools, reporting capabilities, and more for financial institutions, businesses, and fintechs of all sizes. EPS helps its clients succeed in today\u2019s competitive market to increase revenue, improve efficiencies, better manage compliance, and enhance customer relationships.  \u2022iPay SolutionsTM provides consumers and businesses with money movement options through their financial institutions\u2019 digital platforms including paying bills, sending money to anyone and transferring funds between their own accounts. iPay\u2019s extensive application programming interface (\"API\") and hosted interfaces allow for multiple levels of integration by digital platforms and financial institutions. iPay provides financial institutions with services and tools to increase adoption, support end-users and monitor fraud. The money movement options keep the consumers and businesses engaged with the financial institution. \u2022PayrailzTM supports our technology modernization strategy by adding next generation digital payment capabilities to our payment\u2019s ecosystem based on cloud native microservices.  Our new Money Movement payments platform includes native artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), Action Insights (which is predictive and proactive recommendations through AI), a flexible modern user experience, a layered security model, an automated fraud feature leveraging machine learning, and a modern and flexible administrative portal.  In addition to bill payment capabilities, we have a \u2018pay a loan\u2019 feature, an \u2018open looped\u2019 real-time person-to-person (\"P2P\") solution, and account-to-account (\"A2A\") transfer features.   \u2022JHA PayCenterTM, provides our customer financial institutions with a single entry point to both Zelle\u00ae and Real Time Payments (\"RTP\") real-time networks and supports the Federal Reserve's FedNow\u00ae, which launched in July 2023. PayCenter manages the certification process and mandatory updates from the networks, simplifies integration with toolkits and provides fraud monitoring. Financial institutions can send and receive transactions instantly 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through our core and complementary solutions. \u2022Payments as a Service (\"PaaS\") ties together and further enhances the complete array of electronic payments functionality with a front-end Payments Developers Experience Portal and back-end data analytics. 10 10 10   Research and Development We invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance. We enhance our core and complementary systems a minimum of once each year. Product-specific enhancements are largely customer-driven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups, change control boards, strategic initiatives meetings, annual user group meetings, and ongoing customer contact. We also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $142.7 million, $121.4 million, and $109.0 million, respectively. We recorded capitalized software in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 of $166.1 million, $148.2 million, and $128.3 million, respectively. Sales and Marketing We serve established, well-defined markets that provide ongoing sales and cross-sales opportunities. The marketing and sales initiatives within the core business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions. Our non-core specialized core-agnostic niche solutions are sold to complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters. Sales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new customers in assigned territories, and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing customer relationships and cross selling additional products and services. Our sales professionals receive base salaries and performance-based commission compensation. Sales support staff provide a variety of services, including product and service demonstrations, responses to prospect-issued requests-for-proposals, and proposal and contract generation. Our marketing department supports sales with lead generation and brand-building activities, including participation in state-specific, regional, and national trade shows; print and online advertising; telemarketing; customer/client newsletters; ongoing promotional campaigns; and media relations. We also host annual national education conferences which provide opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services. Jack Henry has sold select products and services outside the United States, primarily in Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada. International sales accounted for less than 1% of Jack Henry\u2019s total revenue in each of fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021. Competition The market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive, and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong. Some of our current competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and greater financial resources. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include product/service functionality, price, operating flexibility and ease-of-use, customer support, and existing customer references. For more than a decade, there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions, and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future. Our core solutions compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions, including Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.; Fiserv, Inc.; and Finastra. Our non-core specialized solutions compete with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities. Intellectual Property, Patents, and Trademarks \u00a0 Although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights, our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology. We have registered or filed applications for our primary trademarks. Most of our technology is not patented. Instead, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, resellers, customers, and potential customers. Access to and distribution of our Company\u2019s source code is restricted, and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain, or use our products or technology.  11 11 11   Regulatory Compliance We maintain a corporate commitment to address compliance issues and implement requirements imposed by federal regulators prior to the effective date of such requirements when adequate prior notice is given. Our compliance program is coordinated by a team of compliance analysts and auditors with extensive regulatory agency and financial institution experience, and a thorough working knowledge of Jack Henry and our solutions. These compliance professionals leverage multiple channels to remain informed about potential and recently enacted regulatory requirements, including regular discussions on emerging topics with the Federal Banking Agencies (\u201cFBA\u201d) examination team and training sessions sponsored by various professional associations. Jack Henry has a process to inform internal stakeholders of new and revised regulatory requirements. Upcoming regulatory changes also are presented to the Company\u2019s development teams through monthly regulatory compliance meetings and the necessary product changes are included in the ongoing product development cycle. We publish newsletters to keep our customers informed of regulatory changes that could impact their operations. Periodically, customer advisory groups are assembled to discuss significant regulatory changes. Internal audits of our systems, networks, operations, business recovery plans, and applications are conducted and specialized outside firms are periodically engaged to perform testing and validation of our systems, processes, plans and security. The FBA conducts annual reviews throughout the Company and issues a Report of Examination. The Board of Directors provides oversight of these activities through the Risk and Compliance Committee and the Audit Committee. Government Regulation The financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. All financial institutions are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision. Our products and services must comply with the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our customers, including but not limited to those mandated by federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information regulations, usury laws, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The compliance of Jack Henry\u2019s products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors, including the parameters set through the interactive design, the classification of customers, and the manner in which the customer utilizes the products and services. Our customers are contractually responsible for assessing and determining what is required of them under these regulations and then we provide solutions that assist them in meeting their regulatory needs through our products and services. We cannot predict the impact these regulations, any future amendments to these regulations or any newly implemented regulations will have on our business in the future. Jack Henry is not chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (\"OCC\"), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the NCUA or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise depository institutions. However, operating as a service provider to financial institutions, Jack Henry\u2019s operations are governed by the same regulatory requirements as those imposed on financial institutions, and subject to periodic reviews by FBA regulators who have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews. We provide private cloud services through JHA OutLink Processing Services\u2122 for banks and EASE Processing Services\u2122 for credit unions. We provide data centers and electronic transaction processing through JHA Card Processing Solutions\u2122, internet banking through NetTeller\u00ae and BannoTM online solutions, bill payment through iPay, network security monitoring and Hosted Network Solutions (\"HNS\") through our Gladiator\u00ae unit, cloud services through Hosted Partner Services and Enterprise Integration Services, and business recovery services through Centurion Disaster Recovery\u00ae. Our private cloud services are subject to examination by FBA regulators under the Bank Service Company Act. These examinations cover a wide variety of subjects, including system development, functionality, reliability, and security, as well as disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. Our private cloud services are also subject to examination by state banking authorities on occasion. Information and Cybersecurity In our increasingly interconnected environment, information is inherently exposed to a growing number of risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. As a provider of products and services to financial institutions, we use industry standard policies and procedures to process and store sensitive, personally identifiable information securely. We prioritize  12 12 12   protecting our associates, clients, and their private data from the ever-evolving cyber threat environment and ensuring the resiliency of such information.  We have an established information and cybersecurity program maintained by a team of diverse, highly skilled cybersecurity professionals, as well as a portfolio of investments in modern technology including artificial intelligence and machine learning. The program incorporates industry-standard frameworks, policies, and practices designed to protect the confidentiality and privacy of Jack Henry\u2019s and our clients\u2019 information. Additionally, we maintain insurance that includes cybersecurity coverage.  In support of the program, our systems and services undergo regular reviews performed by the same regulatory agencies that review financial institutions: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"), Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\"), FDIC, NCUA, and the OCC, among others. Reviews such as those by the Federal Banking agencies (a regulatory group comprised of the FDIC, FRB, and the OCC) assess and identify security gaps or flaws in controls and monitor the effectiveness of our security program. Critical services provided to our clients are subject to annual System and Organization Controls (\"SOC\") reviews by independent auditors. Information and cybersecurity leadership reports to the Risk and Compliance Board committee and the full Board of Directors quarterly, on information security and cybersecurity matters. Human Capital Our Employees As of June\u00a030, 2023, we had approximately 7,120 full-time and part-time employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and there have been no labor-related work stoppages.  Talent Attraction and Engagement Our people and culture strategy focuses on attracting, engaging, and retaining qualified, diverse, and innovative talent at all levels of the Company. We are a committed equal opportunity employer and all qualified candidates receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, pregnancy, genetic information, or other characteristics protected by applicable law. Beyond nondiscrimination compliance, we are committed to fostering a respectful, diverse, and inclusive workplace in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. We continue to concentrate efforts on diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging and continue to hire employees in the human resources function to focus on this important area. We seek nontraditional talent streams to help identify candidates from underrepresented groups, including through our internship and apprenticeship programs. Our internship program focuses on attracting college and university students to paid work in Jack Henry departments related to their studies, while our apprenticeship program offers paid training and work for candidates (either students or non-students) with little to no traditional experience in the field, such as learning computer coding. Both our internship and apprenticeship programs can lead to full-time employment.  We continue to engage our Business Innovation Groups (\u201cBIGs\u201d) to develop attraction and retention suggestions and practices that advance a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture. Our BIGs are company-sponsored groups open to all employees. As of June\u00a030, 2023, we had over 1,840 unique associates participating in seven active BIGs, with six focused on inclusion for specific communities \u2014 women, people of color, remote employees, LGBTQ+, veterans, and people with disabilities \u2014 and one focused on environmental and sustainability topics. While BIGs allow employees to connect and support each other, they also function to assist us in addressing bona fide business problems through input and suggestions. For example, these groups work with executive leadership to actively improve our talent attraction processes for prospective employees. They also provide education, training, and conversation opportunities to all employees to increase belongingness and to advance diversity, inclusion, understanding, and innovation throughout the Company. JHAnywhere, a BIG formed previously to provide community and resources for the then minority of employees working remotely, was discontinued in July 2023 due to the proliferation of remote work resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic to the extent that such efforts became a company-wide focus that went beyond the capacity of a single BIG to support. The Company remains focused on equipping all employees with the tools necessary to effectively communicate, collaborate, and build connections in a remote environment, including ensuring leaders have the skills needed to effectively lead dispersed teams. We seek to actively listen to our employees throughout the year using a defined and continuous listening strategy designed to gather regular feedback on well-being, engagement, leadership, ethics, culture and values, and other top of mind topics. These surveys allow us to respond to employee concerns, benefit from employee perspectives, and better design and develop processes to support our Company culture. Employees can learn about changes  13 13 13   through our jhDaily online news center, regular email communications, monthly Manager Forum events, quarterly employee update videos or all-employee town hall meetings delivered by senior management.   Training and Development Our success depends not only on attracting and retaining talented employees, but also in developing our current employees and providing new opportunities for their growth. We offer our employees numerous live and on-demand courses, resources, and training programs to help them build knowledge, improve skills, and develop their career at Jack Henry. Learning opportunities include mandatory courses, such as security awareness, as well as recommended content in areas including leadership development; technical skills; and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. Jack Tracks, an annual, company-wide virtual learning event, offers employees a large selection of curated topics such as technical and operational readiness, technology trends, company solutions, and industry trends. Recognizing the importance of mentoring in career development, we host an internal mentorship marketplace, which allows prospective mentors and mentees to connect and self-initiate a mentoring relationship. Career mobility and personal development resources are available to all employees through dedicated intranet sites. We continue to strengthen our leadership capacity by providing training on effective coaching practices to leaders of the Company. We recognize and value the contribution of our employees who develop, improve, and support our technology solutions. Access to on-demand technical training libraries, customized learning plans, certification programs, and classes facilitated by external experts are available to advance their technical expertise. When there is a critical skill need or where the technology landscape is rapidly changing, we provide unique learning solutions to align employees' development with our strategic initiatives. Wellness and Safety We emphasize the safety and well-being of our employees as a top priority. We define wellness comprehensively and include mental, physical, emotional, financial, psychological, and environmental considerations. Our benefit plan offerings include supportive and dedicated campaigns that communicate directly to employees about financial wellness, mental health, healthful nutrition and exercise, and other wellness topics. Employee well-being is further supported through policies such as remote work, paid parental leave, military service leave, educational assistance, and bereavement leave policies.
