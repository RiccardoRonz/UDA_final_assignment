{"cik": 827054, "item_1A": "Item 1.\u00a0Business  Overview \u00a0 We develop, manufacture and sell smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions used by our customers for a wide variety of applications.  With over 30 years of technology leadership, our broad product portfolio is a Total System Solution (TSS) for our customers that can provide a large portion of the silicon requirements in their applications.  TSS is a combination of hardware, software and services which help our customers increase their revenue, reduce their costs and manage their risks compared to other solutions.  Our synergistic product portfolio empowers disruptive growth trends, including 5G, data centers, sustainability, Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving, and electric vehicles, in key end markets such as automotive, aerospace and defense, communications, consumer appliances, data centers and computing, and industrial.  Business and Macroeconomic Environment  In the first half of fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic initially resulted in a global disruption in economic activity by adversely affecting production, creating supply chain and market disruption, and adversely impacting businesses and individuals.  However, in the second half of fiscal 2021, business conditions were unexpectedly strong as businesses and individuals adapted to the effects of the pandemic.  In response to global supply constraints, we worked to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business by qualifying alternative suppliers, increasing our inventory of raw materials, ramping our internal factories and adding assembly and test capacity to increase our manufacturing capability while securing additional capacity with our subcontractors wherever possible.  Strong customer demand for our products continued to outpace capacity in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. However, in recent months, many of our customers felt the effects of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty and customer requests to push out or cancel backlog increased in the March 2023 quarter.  Consistent with the slowing macroeconomic environment, and the growth in our inventory, we have paused most of our factory expansion activity, reduced our planned capital investments for fiscal 2024, and taken steps to lower our inventory in the coming quarters.  We are unable to predict the timing or impact of any such slowdown on our business.      In order to provide prioritized capacity to our customers, we launched our Preferred Supply Program in February 2021, which provides our customers with prioritized capacity beginning six months after the customer places an order for 12 months of continuous, non-cancellable and non-reschedulable backlog.  Although orders under such program cannot be cancelled or rescheduled by the customer, in recent periods, we have accommodated requests by customers to push-out certain orders to help them manage inventory levels and, in some cases, to help other customers that are experiencing supply shortages.  Since the March 2022 quarter, we have been entering into long-term supply agreements (LTSAs) with certain of our customers for products that will be shipped in future periods.  We also entered into certain LTSAs with key suppliers.   In response to the pandemic, we have taken proactive preventative measures to enable a safe environment for our employees and operation of our manufacturing sites.  While our global manufacturing sites have been fully operational in recent periods, we strategically implemented plans intended to provide more assurance of business continuity in the event severe outbreaks or government requirements were to impact our operations.  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents Industry Background \u00a0 Competitive pressures require OEMs to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost.\u00a0\u00a0To address these requirements, manufacturers often use integrated circuit-based embedded control systems that enable them to:\u00a0 \u2022differentiate their products \u2022replace less efficient electromechanical control devices \u2022reduce the number of components in their system \u2022add product functionality \u2022reduce the system level energy consumption \u2022make systems safer to operate \u2022add security to their products \u2022decrease time to market for their products \u2022significantly reduce product cost  Embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide, including: \u2022actuators \u2022applications requiring touch buttons, touch screens and graphical user interfaces \u2022automotive access control \u2022automotive comfort, safety, information and entertainment applications \u2022avionics \u2022communication infrastructure systems \u2022consumer electronics \u2022defense and military hardware \u2022electric vehicles \u2022handheld tools \u2022home and building automation \u2022industrial automation \u2022large and small home appliances \u2022medical devices \u2022motor controls \u2022portable computers and accessories \u2022power supplies \u2022residential and commercial security systems \u2022robotics \u2022routers and video surveillance systems \u2022satellites \u2022smart home and IoT edge devices \u2022smart meters and energy monitoring \u2022storage and server systems  \u2022touch control \u2022wireless communication  Embedded control systems typically incorporate a mixed-signal microcontroller, microprocessor or FPGA as the principal active, and sometimes sole, component.\u00a0\u00a0A mixed-signal microcontroller is a self-contained computer-on-a-chip consisting of a central processing unit, often with on-board non-volatile program memory for program storage, random access memory for data storage and various analog and digital input/output peripheral capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the mixed-signal microcontroller, a complete embedded control system often incorporates application-specific software, various analog, mixed-signal, timing, connectivity, security and non-volatile memory components such as EEPROMs and Flash memory. \u00a0 The increasing demand for embedded control systems has made the market for mixed-signal microcontrollers a significant segment of the semiconductor market at $26.9 billion1 in calendar year 2022.\u00a0\u00a0Mixed-signal microcontrollers are primarily available in 8-bit through 32-bit architectures.\u00a0\u00a08-bit mixed-signal microcontrollers remain very cost-effective and easy to use for a wide range of high-volume embedded control applications and, as a result, continue to represent a significant portion of the overall mixed-signal microcontroller market.\u00a0\u00a016-bit and 32-bit mixed-signal microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality, and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications.  FPGAs are programmable integrated circuits that are used to implement complex logic functions and can be re-programmed at any time, allowing for multiple implementations and revisions during or after the customer system is manufactured.  Some versions of  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents FPGAs also include a mixed-signal microcontroller or microprocessor core to provide additional system on chip functionality to compute intensive tasks.  The analog segment of the semiconductor market was $93.8 billion1 in calendar year 2022, and this market is fragmented into a large number of sub segments.  1Source: 2022 Gartner Worldwide Semiconductor Market Share by End Market  Our Products  Our strategic focus is on providing cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size, high performance, extreme low power usage, wide voltage range operation, mixed-signal integration, and ease of development, thus enabling timely and cost-effective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products.

We license our Non-Volatile Memory technologies to foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced mixed-signal microcontroller products, gate array, RF, analog and neuromorphic compute products that require embedded non-volatile memory.  Our memory products consist of EEPROMs, Serial Flash memories, Parallel Flash memories, Serial SRAM memories and EERAMs.  Serial EEPROMs, Serial Flash memories, Serial SRAMs and EERAMs have a very low I/O pin requirement, permitting production of very small footprint devices.  We sell our memory products primarily into the embedded control market, complementing our mixed-signal microcontroller offerings.   6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Development Tools \u00a0 We offer a comprehensive set of low-cost and easy-to-learn application development tools.\u00a0\u00a0These tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and microprocessor products for specific applications and, we believe, they are an important factor for facilitating design wins. \u00a0 Our family of development tools for our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and microprocessor products range from entry-level systems, which include an assembler or a compiler and programmer or in-circuit debugging hardware, to fully configured systems that provide in-circuit emulation capability.\u00a0\u00a0We also offer a complete suite of compilers, software code configurators and simulators.  Customers moving from entry-level designs to those requiring real-time emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future mixed-signal microcontroller devices in our portfolio.  Many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our mixed-signal microcontroller and microprocessor product architectures, including an extensive amount of third-party tool suppliers whose products support our mixed-signal microcontroller architectures. \u00a0 We believe that familiarity with and adoption of development tools from Microchip as well as from third-party development tool partners by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products.\u00a0\u00a0These development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of application-specific products from our standard mixed-signal microcontrollers.   Manufacturing \u00a0 Our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe, assembly and test.\u00a0\u00a0The ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control, resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry.\u00a0\u00a0By owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical techniques (such as statistical process control, designed experiments and wafer level monitoring), we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields.\u00a0\u00a0Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles.\u00a0\u00a0This control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin.  We outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of Microsemi and other companies that outsourced all or substantial portions of their manufacturing.  We comply with several quality systems, including: ISO9001 (2015 version), IATF16949 (2016 version), AS9100 (2016 version), and TL9000.  Refer to \"Item 2. Properties\" for further information regarding the location and principal operations of our manufacturing facilities.  Wafer Fabrication \u00a0 Fab 2 currently produces 8-inch wafers and supports various manufacturing process technologies, and predominantly utilizes our 0.25 microns to 1.0 microns processes.\u00a0\u00a0During fiscal 2023, we increased Fab 2's capacity to support more advanced technologies by implementing process improvements, upgrading existing equipment, and adding equipment. \u00a0 Fab 4 currently produces 8-inch wafers using predominantly 0.13 microns to 0.5 microns manufacturing processes.\u00a0\u00a0During fiscal 2023, we continued our multi-year $800 million expansion and capital equipment investment plan to increase Fab 4's capacity to support more advanced technologies by implementing process improvements, upgrading existing equipment, and adding new equipment and two clean rooms.  A significant amount of additional clean room capacity in Fab 4 has been brought on line to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs.\u00a0  Fab 5 currently manufactures discrete and specialty products in addition to a lower volume of a diversified set of standard products on 6-inch wafers.  In February 2023, we announced our plan to invest $880 million over the next several years to expand our silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon production capacity, including the production of 8-inch wafers, at our Fab 5 facility.  We believe the combined capacity of Fab 2, Fab\u00a04, and Fab 5 will allow us to respond to future demand for internally fabricated products with incremental capital expenditures.  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents As a result of our acquisition of Microsemi, we acquired several smaller wafer fabrication facilities, which utilize older technologies that are appropriate for the discrete products they manufacture.  We currently plan to continue to operate these fabrication facilities with modest investment to keep them operational with the exception of the facility in Santa Clara, California, which we closed in fiscal 2022.  We continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.\u00a0\u00a0We believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive. \u00a0 We augment our internal manufacturing capabilities by outsourcing a significant portion of our wafer production requirements to third-party wafer foundries.\u00a0 As a result of our acquisitions, we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements.\u00a0\u00a0In fiscal 2023, approximately 63% of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries.  Assembly and Test  \u00a0 We perform product assembly and test at various facilities located around the world.  During fiscal 2023, we increased capacity at our Thailand and Philippines facilities to support more technologies by making process improvements, upgrading existing equipment, and adding equipment.  During fiscal 2023, approximately 59% of our assembly requirements were being performed in our internal facilities and approximately 67% of our test requirements were performed in internal facilities.\u00a0\u00a0We use third-party assembly and test contractors for the balance of our assembly and test requirements.  We plan to continue to invest in assembly and test equipment to increase our internal capacity capabilities and transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.  General Matters Impacting Our Manufacturing Operations \u00a0 Due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing, consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results.\u00a0\u00a0Our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities.\u00a0\u00a0Our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control, extensive employee training and effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment.\u00a0\u00a0Maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results.\u00a0\u00a0The manufacture of integrated circuits, particularly non-volatile, erasable complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) memory and logic devices, such as those that we produce, are complex processes.\u00a0\u00a0These processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment.\u00a0\u00a0As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields.\u00a0\u00a0Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels.  Historically, we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules.\u00a0\u00a0In order to respond to such requirements, we have historically maintained a significant work-in-process and finished goods inventory.  Refer to Note 3 for a summary of our long-lived assets, consisting of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, by geography. \u00a0 We have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors that provide our various materials and service needs.  We generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services, but, in some cases, we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers.   Sales and Distribution \u00a0 General \u00a0 We market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors. \u00a0 Our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia.\u00a0\u00a0We currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets.\u00a0\u00a0We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market.\u00a0\u00a0Many of our CEMs, ESEs, and sales managers have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments.\u00a0\u00a0We believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products.\u00a0\u00a0The primary mission of our ESE team is to provide technical  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team.\u00a0\u00a0ESEs also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through online webcasts. \u00a0 Our licensing division has dedicated sales, technology, design, product, test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees. \u00a0 For information regarding our revenue, results of operations, and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years, refer to our financial statements included in this Form 10-K.  Distribution \u00a0 Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers.\u00a0\u00a0We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base.\u00a0\u00a0We believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel. \u00a0 In fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we derived 47% and 48%, respectively, of our net sales through distributors compared to 53% and 52%, respectively, of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us.  With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which made up 11% of our net sales, no other distributor or direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2023.  In fiscal 2022, no distributor or direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. \u00a0 Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice, with the exception of orders placed under our Preferred Supply Program or otherwise designated as non-cancellable. \u00a0The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.   \u00a0Competition \u00a0 The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has historically been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change.\u00a0\u00a0We compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, some of which have greater market recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products.\u00a0\u00a0We also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied, cloned, pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as China and Taiwan.\u00a0\u00a0We are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis.  We currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products, including the following product characteristics:\u00a0 \u2022performance \u2022analog, digital and mixed-signal functionality and level of functional integration \u2022field programmability \u2022memory density \u2022low power consumption \u2022extended voltage ranges \u2022reliability \u2022security and functional safety \u2022packaging alternatives \u2022comprehensive suite of development tools  We believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include:\u00a0 \u2022our broad product portfolio offers a Total System Solutions through a combination of hardware, software and services  \u2022ease of use \u2022functionality of application development systems \u2022hardware, software and tool compatibility within product families to increase migration flexibility  \u2022dependable delivery, quality and availability \u2022technical and innovative service and support \u2022time to market \u2022total solution cost 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022reference design  We believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors, but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our business.   Patents, Licenses and Trademarks \u00a0 We maintain a portfolio of U.S. and foreign patents, expiring on various dates from 2023 through 2042.\u00a0\u00a0We also have numerous additional U.S. and foreign patent applications pending.\u00a0\u00a0We do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business.\u00a0\u00a0While our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes, we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products.\u00a0\u00a0As with any operating company, the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets, including our pending and existing patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage.\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws.  Further, the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. \u00a0 We have also entered into certain in-bound and outbound intellectual property licenses and cross-licenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes.\u00a0\u00a0As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we and our customers from time to time receive, and may continue to receive, demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0We diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0In most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, however, we cannot be certain that this would be the case, or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided.  Licensees of our technology may become unable to pay, and have in the past and are currently disputing their obligations to pay us royalties or fees.  Litigation, arbitration or other proceedings, which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management, has been and is expected to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others.\u00a0\u00a0The failure to obtain necessary licenses, the necessity of engaging in defensive legal proceedings, or any negative results of these proceedings could harm our business.  Environmental Regulation \u00a0 We must comply with many different federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes.\u00a0\u00a0Our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations.  Any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could result in an increase in capital expenditures such as acquiring costly equipment or other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations.\u00a0\u00a0Any failure by us to adequately control the storage, use, discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities. \u00a0 Increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations.\u00a0\u00a0While we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations, technological changes, or weather, our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of, hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations. \u00a0 Human Capital Resources  Our Employees   We invest in our highly-skilled global workforce of approximately 22,600 people in accordance with our Guiding Value: employees are our greatest strength.  We believe that our culture, values, and organizational development and training programs provide an inclusive work environment where our employees are empowered and engaged to deliver the best embedded control solutions to our customers.
