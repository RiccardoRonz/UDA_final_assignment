Sales of aftermarket parts and services typically represent approximately 60% of total net sales. As a long time supplier of original equipment, we have an extensive installed base of equipment in operation and growing this installed base further will expand our recurring aftermarket sales. Wabtec provides aftermarket parts and services for its components, and we seek to expand this business with customers who currently perform the work in-house. In this way, we expect to benefit as transit authorities and railroads outsource certain maintenance and overhaul functions.  \u2022Drive continuous operational improvement. We are focused on continuous improvement to drive cost competitiveness, effectively deploy capital and accelerate Lean. Lean is a set of principles that emphasize customer focus, elimination of waste, high quality growth and ruthless prioritization of work to improve safety, quality, delivery and cost. Lean is being embedded in our culture and is fundamental to how we execute our strategy. We are using Lean principles to help examine processes and continuously improve them by solving problems at their root cause. Our Lean transformation model focuses on driving process improvements and management systems to maximize the flow of value produced for the customer, remove waste, empower employees and optimize the enterprise. These principles are also rigorously applied to sustainability and safety. Recent Acquisitions See Note 3 of \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this report for additional information about our recent acquisitions. Backlog Backlog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received from customers and approximates the Company\u2019s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. The Company\u2019s total backlog was approximately $22 billion at December\u00a031, 2022. The Company\u2019s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions, including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages. Generally, if a customer were to cancel a contract we would have an enforceable right to payment for work completed up to the date of cancellation which would include a reasonable profit margin. Substantial scope-of-work adjustments are common. For these and other reasons, completion of the Company\u2019s backlog may be delayed or canceled. The railroad industry, in general, has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation. The roll forward of the Company's backlog of firm customer orders and the expected year of completion are as follows:\u00a0In millions Freight SegmentTransit SegmentConsolidated\u00a0Balance at December 31, 2021$18,502\u00a0$3,667\u00a0$22,169\u00a0\u00a0New orders 6,294\u00a02,742\u00a09,036\u00a0\u00a0Less: Net sales (6,012)(2,350)(8,362)\u00a0Adjustments / foreign exchange, net (143)(259)(402)\u00a0Balance at December 31, 2022$18,641\u00a0$3,800\u00a0$22,441\u00a0\u00a0Expected Delivery 2023$4,901\u00a0$1,859\u00a0$6,760\u00a0\u00a0Other years $13,740\u00a0$1,941\u00a0$15,681\u00a0 8 8 8   Although the current unfavorable global economic conditions have not resulted in any material cancellations, they have impacted the timing of some orders in backlog as, in certain cases, the delivery of goods and services were pushed out from their original timelines. Engineering and Development To execute our strategy to develop new products, we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities.

The system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets. Intellectual Property We have approximately 6,000 active patents worldwide and on average file for approximately 300 new patents each year. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property. We actively monitor competitor patent issuance during our product development to reduce litigation risks, and we follow their product development practices to monitor possible patent infringement by them, and to evaluate their strategies and plans. Trademarks we utilize can be licensed from other companies, acquired as part of mergers or acquisitions, or have been developed through the normal course of business. We have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee. We do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or any of our business segments as a whole. Customers We provide products and services for more than 500 customers worldwide. Our customers include passenger transit authorities and railroads throughout North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Africa and South America; manufacturers of transportation equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, passenger transit vehicles and buses and companies that own, lease, and maintain such equipment, as well as customers in the mining, marine, and industrial markets. Top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2022, our top five customers accounted for approximately 30% of net sales. No one customer represents 10% or more of consolidated net sales. We believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers. Competition We hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally, although market shares vary by product lines and geographies. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very cost-conscious. In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support.

See \"Available Information,\" below.  ESG Goals Wabtec is committed to transparency on ESG topics, including the opportunities and challenges we encounter as we work to enhance performance and conduct business in a responsible manner. In 2020, we established ESG goals around innovation, operations, safety, and people. We report our progress on these goals in our annual Sustainability Report. See \"Available Information,\" below. Wabtec developed an ESG governance framework to provide oversight for our climate action strategy. This structure starts with Wabtec's Board of Directors and its committees who oversee the execution of the Company\u2019s ESG strategy as part of their oversight of Wabtec\u2019s overall business. In particular, the Board established the Environmental, Social and Governance Subcommittee (\"ESG Subcommittee\") of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to support and provide oversight of Wabtec\u2019s sustainability strategy and ongoing commitment to ESG matters relevant to Wabtec, including complying with all applicable laws and regulations affecting the health and safety of our employees and stakeholders, as well as protection of the environment (including climate) and other public policy matters. To further facilitate the Board\u2019s engagement and oversight, ESG was added as a risk category in Wabtec\u2019s enterprise risk management process. Human Capital At Wabtec, we believe performance drives progress, and are committed to developing sustainable transportation solutions that move and improve the world. We are committed to driving an inclusive culture and integrating our talent and capabilities across the enterprise. As a Company, we believe that protecting the health and safety of our people and the environment is the responsibility of everyone at Wabtec.  Our headquarters are in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and we have offices and facilities in over 50 countries around the globe. As of December 31, 2022, we have a global workforce of approximately 27,000 employees, excluding contingent workers.  A portion of our workers are represented by labor unions. For 2023, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), Locals 506 and 618 collective bargaining agreement, covering approximately 1,400 locomotive manufacturing workers in Erie, Pennsylvania, expires on June 9, 2023. Negotiations with UE will begin in 2023. The Company continuously monitors its labor activity.   Diversity and Inclusion Wabtec is committed to ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace that respects and seeks the unique talents, experiences and viewpoints of all our employees. Wabtec has a Diversity and Inclusion Council, led by members of Wabtec\u2019s executive leadership team, who oversee global diversity and inclusion policies and initiatives. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where employees can be themselves. During 2022, we created the position of Global Diversity & Inclusion Leader to drive progress on our commitment to promoting diversity and fostering an inclusive workplace that attracts, develops and retains diverse talent. Our Board of Directors also plays a critical role in creating an organization that prioritizes, supports, and invests in diversity, inclusion, and equity. Over the last three years, Wabtec has named three diverse members to its Board, with 55% of Wabtec\u2019s Board currently considered diverse (gender; race/ethnicity). In 2021, women constituted approximately 17% of our global workforce and approximately 19% of our salaried employees, and people of color constituted approximately 20% of our U.S. salaried workforce and approximately 24% of the total U.S. workforce.  Training and Development We continually invest in our employees\u2019 career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring and coaching programs. We have invested in training courses through Wabtec\u2019s Learning Management System (\"LMS\"). In 2021, Wabtec partnered with a third-party to provide diversity and inclusion training. In 2022, Wabtec continued this partnership, refining the program to our company-wide initiatives. Over 5,000 employees have participated in the training, which was coupled with tools and resources for people leaders to help make diversity and inclusion part of a long-term conversation rather than a one-time training.  Our two-year Leadership, Expertise, Advancement and Development (\"LEAD\") program is the primary path for university graduates into Wabtec. LEAD is a two-year program that offers an immersive learning experience in the fields of engineering, operations, finance and IT along with extensive leadership training designed to build the next generation of leaders. On average, there are 100 participants in the LEAD program that rotate between business units every six months to  11 11 11   work on strategic projects and assignments, gain exposure to senior leadership and build their global professional network. We are focused on strengthening this program to support our global talent pipeline. Environmental, Health and Safety  At Wabtec, our commitment to environmental, health and safety (\"EHS\") is at the heart of our core values. The well-being of our employees, the communities where we operate, and our customers and their customers depends on it. To ensure operational accountability for EHS across all levels of Wabtec, we use standard metrics (both lagging and leading indicators) and structured management reviews to track and measure EHS performance across all our operational sites. Each site is responsible for developing a risk reduction plan to drive site or project-level actions related to risk reduction, employee engagement, and continuous EHS improvement. Monthly EHS operating reviews with the Executive Vice President for Global Operations are used to review operational risks at the enterprise-level, develop strategic initiatives, and communicate key performance indicators to senior management. In 2022, we continued our progress toward best-in-class EHS performance by strengthening our focus on compliance assurance, risk reduction, and learning and development. We also continued our efforts to comprehensively deploy and validate effective and consistent adherence with the Environment, Health, and Safety component of the Wabtec Management System (known as the \u201cEHS WMS\u201d) to strengthen our management system approach to addressing EHS risks and promote the consistent implementation of best practices across all our global manufacturing and services sites, regardless of how local laws are implemented or enforced. We also improved our focus on proactive risk reduction in our operations by conducting monthly incident review sessions with our site Operations and EHS teams to review common incidents, discuss corrective actions, and share best practices. Through these enhanced incident learning efforts, our Operations and EHS teams are partnering to eliminate and reduce hazards and risks within Wabtec\u2019s operations, which is fundamental to improved EHS performance. With zero fatalities and over 65 operational sites with zero recordable injuries, 2022 saw a 10% injury rate reduction across Wabtec's operations as compared with 2021. In 2022, Wabtec continued its EHS leadership training course aimed at building the toolkits of general managers and plant managers to empower them as critical stewards of our EHS culture. This course instills Wabtec\u2019s EHS expectations of its Operational Leaders by providing an awareness of EHS impacts and legal and compliance responsibilities, practical tips for achieving and maintaining EHS excellence, and ideas for cultivating a positive culture and engaging employees to take ownership for EHS. As of 2022, approximately 175 leaders from over 25 countries have attended the training. Compensation and Benefits We remain committed to a strong pay-for performance philosophy that aligns individual performance, behaviors and business results with individual rewards. To deliver on that commitment, we utilize market data to benchmark to the external market, and consider factors such as an employee\u2019s role and experience, the location of the job and performance when determining compensation.  We provide our employees resources to help them succeed. We offer a wide range of benefits including healthcare and wellness benefits, retirement benefits, an Employee Assistance Program, Employee Resource Groups to build diverse and inclusive communities at Wabtec, and paid time off. Cybersecurity Framework  Cybersecurity and data protection are important considerations in the design and production of Wabtec products, projects, and services. Information technology is used and relied upon extensively by our business. We collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential customer information, including proprietary business information, personal data and other information, some of which may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed data protection controls. To address risks related to cybersecurity and privacy, Wabtec seeks to leverage industry cybersecurity practices that have been developed by organizations such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Standardization Organization (ISO) and also engages external independent advisors. Wabtec\u2019s Data Protection Plan describes the technical, physical and administrative controls used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information provided to and managed by Wabtec. Cybersecurity is addressed and discussed regularly with our Chief Information Officer, the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Wabtec also maintains SOC 1 Type 2 certification for select digital products, as well as cyber liability insurance coverage. We also regularly evaluate our response readiness, including disaster recovery plans and business continuity considerations in the case of a cyber incident. Finally, Wabtec engages in regular security awareness training to highlight and educate its employees on how to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks at the individual level. Regulation In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations and standards of governments and other agencies in the U.S. and around the world. These entities typically govern equipment, safety and interoperability standards for freight rail rolling stock and passenger transit, oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers.\u00a0New products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy. As a result of these regulations and requirements, we must usually obtain and  12 12 12   maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries.\u00a0The governing bodies include the FRA and the Association of American Railroads (\"AAR\") in the U.S., and the International Union of Railways (\u201cUIC\u201d) and the European Railway Agencies in Europe. Also, in Europe, the European Committees for Standardization continually draft new European standards which cover, for example, the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety of railways systems. To guarantee interoperability in Europe, the European Union for Railway Agencies is responsible for defining and implementing Technical Standards of Interoperability, which covers areas such as infrastructure, energy, rolling stock, telematic applications, traffic operation and management subsystems, noise pollution and waste generation, protection against fire and smoke, and system safety. Most countries and regions in which Wabtec does business have similar rule-making bodies. For example, in China any product or system sold on the Chinese market must have been certified in accordance with national standards. In the local Indian market, most products are covered by regulations patterned after AAR and UIC standards. Effects of Seasonality Our business has limited seasonality. Third quarter results may be affected by the timing of services performed under our locomotive maintenance contracts and vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers. Fourth quarter results may be affected by the timing of spare parts and service orders placed by transit agencies worldwide. Quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of projects in backlog and by project delays. Environmental Matters The Company's operations and products are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, discharges into water, the use, handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes its operations and products currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.
