{"cik": 1300514, "item_1A": "ITEM\u00a01.\u00a0\u2014 BUSINESS Our Company Las Vegas Sands Corp. (\"LVSC,\" or together with its subsidiaries \"we\" or the \"Company\") is a Fortune 500 company and the leading global developer and operator of destination properties (\"Integrated Resorts\") that feature premium accommodations, world-class gaming, entertainment and retail malls, convention and exhibition facilities, celebrity chef restaurants and other amenities. We currently own and operate Integrated Resorts in Macao and Singapore.  We believe our geographic diversity, best-in-class properties and convention-based business model provide us with the best platform in the hospitality and gaming industry to continue generating growth and cash flow while simultaneously pursuing new development opportunities.  Our unique convention-based marketing strategy allows us to attract business travelers during the slower mid-week periods while leisure travelers occupy our properties during the weekends.  Our convention, trade show and meeting facilities, combined with the on-site amenities offered at our Macao and Singapore Integrated Resorts, provide flexible and expansive space for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (\"MICE\"). We focus on the mass market, which comprises our most profitable gaming segment.  We believe the mass market segment will continue to deliver long-term growth as a result of the introduction of more high-quality gaming facilities and non-gaming amenities into our markets, particularly in Asia. Our properties also cater to high-end players by providing them with luxury amenities and premium service levels.  These amenities include luxury accommodations, restaurants, lounges, invitation-only clubs and private gaming salons.  In each of the regions where we operate, the Paiza brand is associated with certain of these exclusive facilities and represents an important part of our VIP gaming marketing strategy.  We also offer players club loyalty programs at our properties, which provide access to rewards, privileges and members-only events.  Additionally, we believe being in the retail mall business and, specifically, owning some of the largest retail properties in Asia will provide meaningful value for us, particularly as the retail market in Asia continues to grow. Through our 69.9% ownership of Sands China Ltd. (\"SCL\"), we own and operate a collection of Integrated Resorts in the Macao Special Administrative Region (\"Macao\") of the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\" or \"China\").  These properties include The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel (\"The Venetian Macao\"); The Londoner Macao; The Parisian Macao; The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao, Cotai Strip (the \"Four Seasons Macao\"); and the Sands Macao. In Singapore, we own and operate the iconic Marina Bay Sands, which opened in 2010 and is one of Singapore's major tourist, business and retail destinations. We are dedicated to being a good corporate citizen, anchored by the core values of serving people, planet and communities.  We strive to deliver a positive working environment for our team members worldwide and pledge to promote the advancement of aspiring team members through a range of educational partnerships, grants and leadership training.  We also drive social impact through our Sands Cares charitable giving and community engagement program, and environmental performance through our award-winning Sands ECO360 global sustainability program (\"Sands ECO360\").  Through Sands ECO360, we develop and implement environmental practices to protect natural resources, offer our team members a safe and healthy work environment, and enhance the resort experiences of our guests.  In 2022, for the third consecutive year, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index and to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, recognizing our leadership and performance across economic, environmental and social areas. We are committed to creating and investing in industry-leading policies and procedures to safeguard our patrons, partners, employees and neighbors.  Project Protect is our responsible gaming, anti-human trafficking and financial crime prevention program.  Our industry-leading Integrated Resorts provide substantial contributions to our host communities including growth in leisure and business tourism, sustained job creation and ongoing financial opportunities for local small and medium-sized businesses. 3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents LVSC was incorporated in Nevada in August\u00a02004.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements.  See \"Item\u00a07 \u2014 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our principal operating and developmental activities occur in two geographic areas: Macao and Singapore.  Management reviews the results of operations for each of its operating segments, which generally are our Integrated Resorts.  In Macao, our operating segments are: The Venetian Macao; The Londoner Macao; The Parisian Macao; The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao; and Sands Macao.  In Singapore, our operating segment is Marina Bay Sands.  Additionally, prior to its sale, our operating segment in the United States, was The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center (together, the \"Las Vegas Operating Properties\") through February 22, 2022, which has been disclosed as a discontinued operation.  We also have ferry operations and various other operations that are ancillary to our Macao properties (collectively, \"Ferry Operations and Other\") that we present to reconcile to our consolidated statements of operations and financial condition.  In addition to our reportable segments noted above, management also reviews construction and development activities for our projects under development, which include the renovation and expansion of our MICE, entertainment and retail product in Macao and the MBS Expansion Project (as later defined). From February 2020 through the date of this report, our operations have been significantly impacted by a global pandemic (the \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic\u201d).  While the details of this impact have been disclosed throughout this document, the following discussion of our business focuses on execution of our business strategies in a non-pandemic environment based on the assumption the global impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic will eventually diminish and our operations will recover as travel and tourism improves in our markets. Strengths and Strategies We believe we have a number of strengths that differentiate our business from our competitors, including: Diversified, high quality Integrated Resort offerings with substantial non-gaming amenities.  Our Integrated Resorts feature non-gaming attractions and amenities including world-class entertainment, expansive retail offerings and market-leading MICE facilities.  These attractions and amenities enhance the appeal of our Integrated Resorts, contributing to visitation, length of stay and customer spending at our resorts.  The broad appeal  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents of our market-leading Integrated Resort offerings in our various markets enables us to serve the widest array of customer segments in each market. Substantial and diversified cash flow from existing operations.  Our Integrated Resorts in Macao and Singapore have contributed 53% and 47% of our total adjusted property EBITDA, respectively, during the previous five years.  In each of these jurisdictions, our cash flow from operations was derived from a combination of gaming and non-gaming sources, including retail malls, hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and MICE. Market leadership in the growing high-margin mass market gaming segment.  In our gaming business, we focus on the high-margin mass gaming segment.  Our combined SCL properties had the highest percentage of gaming win from mass tables and slots of the Macao operators, with an average market share of approximately 30% during the previous five years.  Management estimates our mass market table revenues typically generated a gross margin substantially higher than the gross margin on our VIP table revenues.  Additionally, gross gaming revenue from mass tables and slots has contributed to approximately two-thirds of total gross gaming revenue at Marina Bay Sands during the previous five years. Established brands with broad regional and international market awareness and appeal.  Through a combination of its diversity of amenities, scale of facilities and its distinctive design, The Venetian Macao has remained the foremost example of a themed Integrated Resort in Macao.  The Parisian Macao, our themed property with an iconic replica of the Eiffel Tower and other attractions, along with The Londoner Macao, with its phased opening throughout 2022, has established an interconnected critical mass of European-themed Integrated Resorts that attract multiple segments of leisure and business tourism and drive broad brand awareness both regionally and globally.  As awareness of The Londoner Macao increases, we believe this Integrated Resort has both the quality and scale to enhance the overall reputation and recognition of our Macao portfolio.   Marina Bay Sands is an iconic, architecturally significant Integrated Resort with meaningful scale and visitation.  Due to its distinctive design, multitude of amenities and customer experiences shared on social media, and a prominent position as part of the Singapore skyline, Marina Bay Sands is recognized throughout Asia and globally.  We believe the brand of Marina Bay Sands is unique and as a result, the property is often featured prominently on social media, in filmed entertainment and in other media. Experienced management team with a proven track record.  Mr. Robert G. Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has been an integral part of our executive team from the beginning, joining our founder and previous Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson before The Venetian Resort Las Vegas was constructed.  Mr. Goldstein is one of the most respected and experienced executives in our industry today.  Mr. Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has been with the Company for more than twelve years, including previously serving as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and has prior experience in corporate finance and management.  Our management team is focused on delivering growth, increasing our return on invested capital, balance sheet strength, preserving the Company\u2019s financial flexibility to pursue development opportunities and continuing to execute return of capital to stockholders.  Unique MICE and entertainment facilities.  Our market-leading MICE and entertainment facilities contribute to our markets\u2019 diversification and appeal to business and leisure travelers while diversifying our cash flows and increasing revenues and profit.  Our approximately 2.9 million square feet of global MICE space is designed to meet the needs of meeting planners and corporate events and trade show organizers from around the world.  Our experience and expertise in this industry supports our ability to drive leisure and business tourism to our markets.  The live entertainment program at our properties has been a key traffic driver and has established us as a leader in the field of tourism and leisure activities. Building on our key strengths, we seek to enhance our position as the leading developer and operator of Integrated Resorts and casinos by continuing to implement the following business strategies: Developing and diversifying our Integrated Resort offerings to include a full complement of products and services to cater to different market segments.  Our Integrated Resorts include MICE space, retail, dining and entertainment facilities and a range of hotel offerings, including branded suites and hotel rooms, to cater to different segments of our markets.  We are able to leverage the recognition and the sales, marketing and reservation capabilities of premier hotel brands to attract a wide range of customers in different market segments to our properties.  We believe our partnerships with renowned hotel management partners, our diverse Integrated Resort  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents offerings and the convenience and accessibility of our properties will continue to increase the appeal of our properties to both the business and leisure customer segments. Leveraging our scale of operations to create and maintain an absolute cost advantage.  Management expects to benefit from lower unit costs due to the economies of scale inherent in our operations.  Opportunities for lower unit costs include, but are not limited to: lower utility costs; more efficient staffing of hotel and gaming operations; and centralized transportation, marketing and sales, and procurement.  In addition, our scale allows us to consolidate certain administrative functions. Focusing on the high-margin mass market gaming segment, while continuing to provide luxury amenities and high service levels to our VIP and premium players.  The scale and product mix of our Integrated Resort properties allow us to participate very effectively in all segments of the market.  We believe the mass market segment will continue to exhibit long-term growth as a result of the introduction of more high-quality gaming facilities and non-gaming amenities into our various markets, accompanied by supportive long-term trends in business and leisure tourism.  Our properties are positioned to harness future growth in the mass market that comprise our most profitable gaming segment, while delivering the immersive destination resort experiences that create loyalty with VIP and premium players. Identifying targeted investment opportunities to drive growth across our portfolio.  We will continue to invest in the expansion of our facilities and the enhancement of the leisure and business tourism appeal of our property portfolio. Our planned development projects include fulfilling capital and operating investment requirements as part of our Macao gaming concession, future phases of renovation and redevelopment of The Londoner Macao and the extensive renovation and expansion of Marina Bay Sands. Our Operations Macao The Venetian Macao is the anchor property of our Cotai Strip development and is located approximately two miles from the Taipa Ferry Terminal on Macao's Taipa Island and six miles from the bridge linking Hong Kong, Macao and Zhuhai.

The Londoner Macao (previously Sands Cotai Central), our largest Integrated Resort on the Cotai Strip, is located across the street from The Venetian Macao, The Parisian Macao and The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao.  The Londoner Macao is the result of our renovation, expansion and rebranding of Sands Cotai Central, which included the addition of extensive thematic elements both externally and internally and was completed during 2022.  The Londoner Macao presents a range of new attractions and features, including some of London\u2019s most recognizable landmarks, such as the Houses of Parliament and the Elizabeth Tower (commonly known as \"Big Ben\"), and interactive guest experiences.  The Integrated Resort features four hotel towers.  The first hotel tower consists of Londoner Court with 368 luxury suites and 400 rooms and suites under the St. Regis brand.

The Sands Macao also includes a 289-suite hotel tower, spa facilities and several restaurants and entertainment areas. We operate the gaming areas within our Macao properties pursuant to a 10-year gaming concession that expires in December\u00a02032.  See \"Regulation and Licensing \u2014 Macao Concession.\"  Prior to the current gaming concession, we operated these gaming areas under an amended 20-year subconcession agreement, which expired on December 31, 2022. Singapore Marina Bay Sands opened with approximately 2,600 rooms and suites located in three 55-story hotel towers.  We are currently undertaking extensive renovation work with approximately 2,300 rooms and suites resulting upon completion, which is expected to greatly enhance the positioning of our suite product.  Atop the three towers is the Sands SkyPark, an extensive outdoor recreation area with a 150-meter infinity swimming pool and leading restaurant and nightlife brands.  The Integrated Resort offers approximately 160,000 square feet of gaming space with approximately 500 table games and 2,900 slot machines and ETGs; The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, an enclosed retail, dining and entertainment complex with signature restaurants from world-renowned chefs; an event plaza and promenade; and an art/science museum.  Marina Bay Sands also includes approximately 1.2 million square feet of meeting and convention space and a state-of-the-art theater for top Broadway shows, concerts and gala events.  We operate the gaming area within our Singapore property pursuant to a 30-year casino concession provided under a development agreement entered into in August 2006.  See \"Regulation and Licensing \u2014 Development Agreement with Singapore Tourism Board.\" In April 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, Marina Bay Sands Pte. Ltd. (\"MBS\") entered into an additional development agreement (the \u201cSecond Development Agreement\u201d) with the Singapore Tourism Board (the \"STB\") pursuant to which MBS has agreed to construct a development, which will include a hotel tower with approximately 1,000 rooms and suites, a rooftop attraction, convention and meeting facilities and a state-of-the-art live entertainment arena with approximately 15,000 seats (the \u201cMBS Expansion Project\u201d).  The Second Development Agreement provides for a total project cost of approximately 4.5 billion Singapore dollars (\"SGD,\" approximately $3.3 billion\u00a0at exchange rates in effect on\u00a0December 31, 2022).  We amended our 2012 Singapore Credit Facility to provide for the financing of the development and construction costs, fees and other expenses related to the MBS Expansion Project pursuant to the Second Development Agreement.  On September 7, 2021, we amended the 2012 Singapore Credit Facility, which, among other things, extended the deadline for delivering the construction cost estimate and the construction schedule for the MBS Expansion Project to March 31, 2022.  On March 29, 2022, we  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents entered into a letter agreement with the STB to extend the construction commencement date for the MBS Expansion Project from April 8, 2022 to April 8, 2023.  We are in the process of reviewing the budget and timing of the MBS expansion based on the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other factors.  As a result, the construction cost estimate and construction schedule were not delivered to the lenders by the extended deadline, and we will not be permitted to make further draws on the Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility until these items are delivered.  We do not anticipate material spend related to the MBS Expansion Project prior to the delivery of these items to lenders. Our Markets Macao Macao is the largest gaming market in the world and the only market in China to offer legalized casino gaming. According to Macao government statistics issued publicly on a monthly basis by the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (commonly referred to as the \"DICJ\"), annual gross gaming revenues were 42.20 billion patacas in 2022 (approximately $5.25 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022), a decrease of 51.4% and 85.6% compared to 2021 and 2019, respectively, due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. We welcomed approximately 6\u00a0million visitors to Macao in 2022, compared to the approximately 8\u00a0million visitors in 2021.  We believe visitation will return to pre-pandemic levels and will continue to experience meaningful long-term growth.  We believe this growth will be driven by a variety of factors, including the movement of Chinese citizens to urban centers in China, continued growth of the Chinese outbound tourism market, the increased utilization of existing transportation infrastructure, the introduction of new transportation infrastructure and the continued increase in hotel room inventory in Macao and neighboring Hengqin Island.  There has been significant investment announced and recently completed by concessionaires in new resort development projects on Cotai.  These factors should help increase the critical mass on Cotai and further drive Macao's transformation into a leading business and leisure tourism hub in Asia.  We believe the development of additional integrated resort products in Macao will also drive a higher demand for gaming products. Table games are the dominant form of gaming in Asia, with Baccarat being the most popular game.  We believe we will continue to experience Macao market-leading visitation and are focused on driving high-margin mass market gaming, while providing luxury amenities and high service levels to our VIP and premium players.  We intend to continue to introduce more modern and popular products that appeal to the Asian marketplace and believe our continued improvement in our high-quality gaming product offerings has enabled us to capture a meaningful share of the overall Macao gaming market across all player segments. Proximity to Major Asian Cities Visitors from Hong Kong, South China, Taiwan and other locations in Asia can reach Macao in a relatively short time, using a variety of transportation methods, and visitors from more distant locations in Asia can take advantage of short travel times by air to Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou or Hong Kong, followed by a road, ferry or helicopter trip to Macao.  In addition, numerous air carriers fly directly into Macau International Airport from many major cities in Asia.  Various past COVID-19 related restrictions and closures have impacted these transportation methods. Prior to COVID-19, Macao drew a significant number of customers who are visitors or residents of Hong Kong.  One of the major methods of transportation to Macao from Hong Kong is the jetfoil ferry service, including our ferry services, Cotai Water Jet.  The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (the \u201cHZMB\u201d), which connects Hong Kong, Macao and Zhuhai, has reduced the travel time between Hong Kong and Macao from one hour by ferry to approximately 45 minutes on the road.  The HZMB is part of the Greater Bay Area Initiative and plays a key role in connecting the cities in the Greater Bay Area, facilitating the visitation to Macao.  Macao is also accessible from Hong Kong by helicopter. Competition in Macao Gaming in Macao is administered by the government through concessions awarded to six different concessionaires, of which we are one.  The other concessionaires are SJM Resorts, S.A., Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A., Galaxy Casino, S.A., MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. and Melco Resorts (Macau), S.A. 8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our Macao operations also face competition from other gaming and resort destinations, both in Asia and globally. Singapore Singapore is regarded as having the most developed financial and transportation infrastructure in the Southeast Asia region.  Singapore has established itself as a destination for both business and leisure visitors, offering convention and exhibition facilities as well as world-class shopping malls and hotel accommodations.  In 2006, after a competitive bid process, the Singapore government awarded two concessions to develop and operate two integrated resorts.  We were awarded the concession for the Marina Bay site, which is adjacent to Singapore's central business district, and Genting International was awarded the second site, located on Singapore's Sentosa Island. Based on figures released by the STB, Singapore welcomed approximately 6.3 million international visitors in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, a 1,810.5% increase and a 67.0% decrease compared to the same period in 2021 and 2019, respectively.  The 2022 increase compared to 2021 was due to the easing of travel restrictions in April 2022 that were originally implemented in early 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Tourism receipts were estimated to be SGD 1.89 billion (approximately $1.41 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022) in 2021 (the latest information publicly available at the time of filing).  The Gambling Regulatory Authority (the \"GRA\"), the gaming regulator in Singapore, does not disclose gaming revenue for the market and thus no official figure exists. We believe Marina Bay Sands is ideally positioned within Singapore to cater to both business and leisure visitors.  The Integrated Resort is centrally located within a 20-minute drive from Singapore's Changi International Airport and near the Marina Bay Cruise Center, a deep-water cruise ship terminal, and Bayfront station, a mass rapid transit station.  Marina Bay Sands is also located near several entertainment attractions, including the Gardens by the Bay botanical gardens and the Singapore Sports Hub, a sports complex featuring the 55,000-seat National Stadium. Baccarat is the preferred table game in both VIP and mass gaming.  Additionally, contributions from slot machines and from mass gaming, including ETG offerings, have enhanced the growth of the market.  As Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore market as a whole continue to mature, we expect to broaden our visitor base to continue to capture visitors from around the world. Proximity to Major Asian Cities More than 100 airlines operate in Singapore, connecting it to some 300 cities in approximately 80 countries.  In the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 32\u00a0million passengers passed through Singapore's Changi Airport, an increase of 955% and a decrease of 53% compared to the same period in 2021 and 2019, respectively, due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  In 2019, Changi Jewel, a multi-use retail, hotel and food and beverage destination, opened at Changi Airport, and work is currently underway to expand the number of runways and open a fifth terminal, which would increase passenger capacity.  Based on figures released by the STB, the largest source markets for visitors to Singapore over the last five years ending in 2022 were China and Indonesia.  The STB's methodology for reporting visitor arrivals does not recognize Malaysian citizens entering Singapore by land, although this method of visitation is generally thought to be substantial. Competition in Singapore Gaming in Singapore is administered by the government through the award of licenses to two operators, our Company and Resorts World Sentosa, which is 100% owned by Genting Singapore PLC.  The GRA is required to ensure there will not be more than two casino licenses until January 1, 2031. Our Singapore operations also face competition from other gaming and resort destinations, both in Asia and globally. Retail Mall Operations We own and operate retail malls at our Integrated Resorts at The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao and Marina Bay Sands.  We currently own approximately 2.8 million square feet of gross retail space.  Management believes being in the retail mall business and, specifically, owning some of the largest retail properties in Asia will provide meaningful value for us, particularly as the retail market in Asia continues to grow. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our malls are designed to complement our other unique amenities and service offerings provided by our Integrated Resorts.  Our strategy is to seek out desirable tenants that appeal to our customers and provide a wide variety of shopping options.  We generate our mall revenue primarily from leases with tenants through base minimum rents, overage rents and reimbursements for common area maintenance (\"CAM\") and other expenditures.  For further information related to the financial performance of our malls, see \"Part II \u2014 Item\u00a07 \u2014 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" The tables below set forth certain information regarding our mall operations on the Cotai Strip and at Marina Bay Sands as of December 31, 2022.

Commitment to Environmental Sustainability We focus significant attention on minimizing our environmental impact with the goal of reducing the environmental footprint of our existing properties and offsetting the impact of new developments.  Through Sands ECO360, we endeavor to adapt to emerging trends, support new technologies and foster environmental stewardship in the areas of building design and development, resort management and operations, and meetings, events and entertainment.  The program is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and other key environmental standards in the areas of low carbon transition, water stewardship, waste, plastics and packaging, sourcing and biodiversity.  Our Environmental, Social and Governance Report is available on our website and contains further information on our environmental sustainability performance, including data indices that reflect the reporting requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.  The contents of the Report and our website are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file or furnish with the SEC, and any reference to the Report and our website are intended to be inactive textual references only. In addition to our internal initiatives, we have developed the Drop by Drop Project, a collaborative water stewardship initiative in conjunction with Clean the World Foundation.  The Drop by Drop Project is designed to encourage sustainability in our local regions and reinvests capital from our water stewardship efforts into innovative water projects in Macao and Singapore.  Development Projects We regularly evaluate opportunities to improve our product offerings, such as refreshing our meeting and convention facilities, suites and rooms, retail malls, restaurant and nightlife mix and our gaming areas, as well as other revenue generating additions to our Integrated Resorts.  Macao As part of the Concession (defined below) entered into by VML and the Macao government, VML has a financial commitment to spend 30.24\u00a0billion patacas (approximately $3.77\u00a0billion at exchange rates in effect on\u00a0December 31, 2022) through 2032 on both capital and operating projects, including 27.80\u00a0billion patacas (approximately $3.46\u00a0billion at exchange rates in effect on\u00a0December 31, 2022) in non-gaming projects that will also appeal to international visitors (the \"Investment Plan\").  As part of the Investment Plan, VML will dedicate resources to several key areas, including: \u2022A commitment to expand, improve and optimize the scale and quality of its convention centers and related amenities.  This includes the proposed development of a new approximately 18,000-square-meter MICE facility in a new podium adjacent to the existing Cotai Expo, expanding the Company\u2019s footprint of inter-connected meeting space and enabling the hosting of additional large-scale international MICE events.  In connection with these efforts, we will strengthen the planning, organization and international marketing of convention tourism in order to attract global multinational companies to host annual meetings and corporate summits in Macao. 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022The redevelopment of the existing Le Jardin (the \u201cTropical Garden\u201d on the south side of The Londoner Macao) to create a new and unique approximately 50,000-square-meter garden-themed destination.  The proposed garden-themed attraction will include an iconic conservatory together with related themed green spaces and amenities.  The conservatory is intended to become a Macao landmark of international renown, providing a year-round themed attraction for tourists and residents. \u2022An expansion of entertainment and sporting events and offerings to grow international tourism, supported in part by a meaningful reinvestment and upgrade of the Cotai Arena.  We will also develop several new restaurants and introduce innovative international culinary concepts to support Macao\u2019s position as a city of gastronomy.  We will also launch a luxury yacht experience featuring on-board dining and entertainment including celebrity appearances, as well as water sports. Singapore In April 2019, MBS entered into the Second Development Agreement with the STB pursuant to which MBS has agreed to construct a development, which will include a hotel tower with approximately 1,000 rooms and suites, a rooftop attraction, convention and meeting facilities and a state-of-the-art live entertainment arena with approximately 15,000 seats.  The Second Development Agreement provides for a total project cost of approximately SGD 4.5 billion (approximately $3.3 billion\u00a0at exchange rates in effect on\u00a0December 31, 2022), which investment must be completed within eight years from the effective date of the agreement.  The amount of the total project cost will be finalized as we complete design and development and begin construction.  We amended our 2012 Singapore Credit Facility to provide for the financing of the development and construction costs, fees and other expenses related to the MBS Expansion Project pursuant to the Second Development Agreement.  On September 7, 2021, we amended the 2012 Singapore Credit Facility, which, among other things, extended the deadline for delivering the construction cost estimate and the construction schedule for the MBS Expansion Project to March 31, 2022.  On March 29, 2022, we entered into a letter agreement with the STB to extend the construction commencement date for the MBS Expansion Project from April 8, 2022 to April 8, 2023.  We are in the process of reviewing the budget and timing of the MBS expansion based on the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other factors.  As a result, the construction cost estimate and construction schedule were not delivered to the lenders by the extended deadline, and we will not be permitted to make further draws on the Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility until these items are delivered.  We do not anticipate material spend related to the MBS Expansion Project prior to the delivery of these items to lenders. We also began the approximately $1.0\u00a0billion renovation of Marina Bay Sands, which introduces world-class suites in Tower 1 and Tower 2, and substantially upgrades the overall guest experience for premium customers.  This project is in addition to our MBS Expansion Project. Other We continue to evaluate additional development projects in each of our markets and pursue new development opportunities globally.  Regulation and Licensing Macao Concession On December 16, 2022, the Macao government granted VML, SCL's wholly owned subsidiary, one of six concessions to operate casinos in Macao.  VML entered into a concession agreement with the Macao government for the duration of ten years, beginning January 1, 2023 (the \"Concession\").  With the expiry of VML\u2019s subconcession on December 31, 2022, all of our casinos, gaming areas and respective supporting areas located in Sands Macao, The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao, with a total approximate area of approximately 136,000 square meters (representing approximately 4.7% of the total property area of these entities), reverted to and are now owned by the Macao government.  Effective January 1, 2023, all these casinos and gaming areas, as well as respective supporting areas, were temporarily transferred to VML for the duration of the Concession in return for annual payments of 750 patacas per square meter for the first three years and 2,500 patacas per square meter for the following seven years (approximately $93 and $311, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022).  These annual payments will be adjusted annually based on the Macao average price index for the preceding year.  Under the Concession, we are obligated to operate  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents casino games of chance in Macao.  The Concession allows us to operate the casino and gaming areas located in the following properties: Sands Macao, The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and the Four Seasons Macao, The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao.  We are required to invest, or cause to be invested, at least 30.24\u00a0billion patacas (approximately $3.77\u00a0billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022), including 27.80\u00a0billion patacas (approximately $3.46\u00a0billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022) on non-gaming projects.  As part of the investment, we are obligated to develop certain gaming and non-gaming investment projects by December 2032 and dedicate resources to, among others, the attraction of international visitors, conventions and exhibitions, entertainment shows, sporting events, culture and art, health and wellness, and themed attractions, as well as support Macao's position as a city of gastronomy and increase community and maritime tourism.  We will be required to increase our investment in non-gaming projects by up to 20% in the following year if Macao\u2019s annual market gross gaming revenue achieves or exceeds 180\u00a0billion patacas (approximately $22.42\u00a0billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022).  The 20% increase is subject to a deduction of 4% per year if the revenue trigger occurs on or after the sixth year of the term of the Concession (2028). We are subject to licensing and control under applicable Macao law and are required to be licensed by the Macao gaming authorities to operate a casino.  We must pay periodic and regular fees and taxes, and our gaming license is not transferable.  We must periodically submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Macao gaming authorities and furnish any other information the Macao gaming authorities may require.  No person may acquire any rights over the shares or assets of VML without first obtaining the approval of the Macao gaming authorities.  Similarly, no person may operate the casino premises for which the use has been temporarily transferred to us, either through a management agreement or any other contract or through step in rights without first obtaining the approval of, and receiving a license from, the Macao gaming authorities.  The transfer or creation of encumbrances over ownership of shares representing the share capital of VML or other rights relating to such shares, and any act involving the granting of voting rights or other stockholders' rights to persons other than the original owners, would require the approval of the Macao government and the subsequent report of such acts and transactions to the Macao gaming authorities. Our Concession and the applicable Macao laws require, among other things: (i) approval of the Macao government for transfers of shares in VML, or of any rights over or inherent to such shares, including the grant of voting rights or other stockholder's rights to persons other than the original owners, as well as for the creation of any charge, lien or encumbrance on such shares; (ii) approval of the Macao government for transfers of shares, or of any rights over such shares, in any of our direct or indirect stockholders, provided that such shares or rights are directly or indirectly equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5% of VML's share capital; (iii) that the Macao government be given notice of the creation of any encumbrance or the grant of voting rights or other stockholder's rights to persons other than the original owners on shares in any of the direct or indirect stockholders in VML, provided that such shares or rights are equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5% of VML's share capital; (iv) that the Macao government be given notice of listing on a stock exchange by any indirect stockholders holding shares equal to or higher than 5% of VML's share capital; and (v) that the Macao government be given prior notice of any relevant financial decision exceeding 10% of the share capital of VML five days before that decision is taken.  The requirements in provisions (ii) and (iii) above will not apply, however, to securities listed as tradable on a stock exchange.  VML and any of its subsidiaries where VML is a dominant shareholder cannot be listed in any stock exchange. The Macao gaming authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, us to determine whether our suitability and/or financial capacity is affected by this individual.  LVSC and SCL shareholders with 5% or more of the share capital, directors and key employees must apply for and undergo a finding of suitability process and maintain due qualification during the Concession term, and accept the persistent and long-term inspection and supervision exercised by the Macao government.  VML is required to notify the Macao government immediately should VML become aware of any fact that may be material to the appropriate qualification of any shareholder who owns 5% or more of the share capital, or any officer, director or key employee.  Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Macao gaming authorities, and in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensure, the Macao gaming authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in corporate position.  If the Macao gaming authorities were to find one of our officers, directors or key employees unsuitable for licensing, we would have to sever all relationships with that person.  In  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents addition, the Macao gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability after being ordered to do so by the Macao gaming authorities may be found unsuitable.  Any stockholder found unsuitable who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the common stock of a company incorporated in Macao and registered with the Macao Companies and Moveable Assets Registrar (a \"Macao registered corporation\") beyond the period of time prescribed by the Macao gaming authorities may lose their rights to the shares.  We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us, we: \u2022pay that person any dividend or interest upon its shares; \u2022allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through shares held by that person; \u2022pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or \u2022fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require that unsuitable person to relinquish its shares. The Macao gaming authorities also have the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation holding a gaming license. In addition, the Macao gaming authorities require prior approval for any loan or similar financing transaction above 100\u00a0million patacas (approximately $12\u00a0million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022) where VML is a borrower or a lender, or where it involves the creation of liens and encumbrances over VML's assets and restrictions on stock. Macao gaming authorities also require to be given prior notice of any relevant financial decision five days before that decision is taken, including but not limited to internal movement of funds exceeding 50% of the share capital of VML, and any other decision exceeding 10% of the share capital of VML, namely labor-related decisions such as payment of salaries and employment benefits. The Macao gaming authorities must give their prior approval to changes in control of VML through a merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisition, management or consulting agreement or any act or conduct by any person whereby he or she obtains control.  Entities seeking to acquire control of a Macao registered corporation must satisfy the Macao gaming authorities concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control.  The Macao gaming authorities may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process of the transaction. The Macao gaming authorities may consider some management opposition to corporate acquisitions, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Macao gaming licensees, and the Macao registered corporations affiliated with such operations, to be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Concession requires the Macao gaming authorities' prior approval of any recapitalization plan proposed by VML's Board of Directors.  The Chief Executive of Macao could also require VML to increase its share capital if he deemed it necessary. The Concession also allows the Macao government to request various changes in the plans and specifications of our Macao properties and to make various other decisions and determinations that may be binding on us.  For example, the Macao government has the right to require that we contribute additional capital to our Macao subsidiaries or that we provide certain deposits or other guarantees of performance in any amount determined by the Macao government to be necessary.  VML is limited in its ability to raise additional capital by the need to first obtain the approval of the Macao gaming and governmental authorities before raising certain debt or equity. The Concession requires VML to submit to the Macao government an annual execution proposal of the specific projects mentioned in the Concession\u2019s Investment Plan up to three months before the start of each calendar year, detailing each project it intends to execute, the proposed amount and the execution schedule for the relevant year.  The annual execution proposal for the year 2023 should be submitted by March 31, 2023.  Within two months after submission of each annual execution proposal, the Macao government will decide on their approval, and may request adjustments to specific projects, to the investment amount and to the execution schedule. If any of our  15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents annual execution proposals or parts thereof are not approved, VML is obliged to propose allocating the relevant funds to other projects related with its activity, which are also subject to approval of the Macao government. Within three months after the end of each calendar year, VML is required to submit a report on the execution of the previous year\u2019s execution proposal.  In addition, VML is subject to the supervision of the Macao government as regards the execution of development projects included in the Concession\u2019s Investment Plan, and VML must submit regular progress reports every two months, and may be requested to submit exceptional detailed reports whenever the normal progress of any development project is compromised.  If our Concession is terminated in the event of a default, the casinos and gaming-related equipment would be automatically transferred back to the Macao government without compensation to us and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations.  In many of these instances, the Concession does not provide a specific cure period within which any such events may be cured and, instead, we would rely on consultations and negotiations with the Macao government to give us an opportunity to remedy any such default. Our Concession allows us to operate games of chance in casinos and gaming areas, but excludes the following gaming activities: mutual bets, lotteries, raffles, interactive gaming and games of chance or other gaming, betting or gambling activities on ships or planes.  Our Concession is exclusively governed by Macao law.  We are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Macao in case of any dispute or conflict relating to our Concession. Our Concession expires on December 31, 2032. If our Concession is not extended or renewed, VML may be prohibited from conducting gaming operations in Macao, and we could cease to generate revenues from our gaming operations when our Concession expires on December 31, 2032.  In addition, all casino premises and gaming-related equipment, which use was temporarily transferred by the Macao government to VML, will be transferred back to the Macao government upon the expiry of our Concession, together with any gaming-related equipment we acquire during our Concession, without any compensation to us.  Under our Concession, we are obligated to pay to the Macao government an annual gaming premium with a fixed portion and a variable portion based on the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated by us.  The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30\u00a0million patacas (approximately $4 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022).  The variable portion is equal to 300,000 patacas per gaming table reserved exclusively for certain kinds of games or players, 150,000 patacas per gaming table not so reserved and 1,000 patacas per electrical or mechanical gaming machine, including slot machines (approximately $37,360, $18,680 and $125, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022), subject to a minimum of 76 million patacas (approximately $9 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022).  We also have to pay a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenues and applicable withholding taxes.  We are also obligated to pay a special annual gaming premium if the average of the gross gaming revenues of our gaming tables and our electrical or mechanical gaming machines, including slot machines, is lower than a certain minimum amount determined by the Macao government; such special premium being the difference between the special gaming tax based on the actual gross gaming revenues and that of the specified minimum amount.  The minimum amount has been set by the Macao government at 7\u00a0million patacas per gaming table and 300,000 patacas per gaming machine (approximately $1\u00a0million and $37,360, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022).  Based on the maximum number of gaming tables and gaming machines we are currently authorized to operate, if the monthly special gaming taxes paid during the year aggregates to less than 4.50\u00a0billion patacas (approximately $561\u00a0million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022), we would be required to pay the difference as the special annual gaming premium.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we paid a total of $3.04\u00a0billion in special gaming taxes and, therefore, would not have had to pay a special gaming premium under the Concession requirements.  We must also contribute 5% of our gross gaming revenue to utilities designated by the Macao government, a portion of which must be used for the promotion of tourism in Macao.  This 5% contribution may be reduced or exempted by the Chief Executive of Macao when the concessionaire has successfully expanded to foreign tourist source markets. Currently, the gaming tax in Macao is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue; however, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions for credit losses.  As a result, if we extend credit to our customers in Macao and are unable to collect on the related receivables from them, we have to pay taxes on our winnings from these customers even though we were unable to collect on the related receivables.  If the laws are not changed, our business in Macao may not be able to realize the full benefits of extending credit to our customers. 16 16 16 Table of Contents Table of Contents In August 2018, we received an additional exemption from Macao's corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for the period of January 1, 2019 through June 26, 2022, and in September 2022, this exemption was extended to December 31, 2022, the date our subconcession agreement expired.  On December 30, 2022, we requested this exemption to be granted for the term of our new Concession. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with the Macao government in April 2019, effective through June 26, 2022, providing for payments as a substitution for a 12% tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits, namely a payment of 38 million patacas (approximately $5 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022) for each of the years 2021 and 2020, each payment made on or before January 31 of the following year, and a payment of 18\u00a0million patacas (approximately $2\u00a0million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022) for the period between January 1, 2022 through June 26, 2022, paid on or before July 26, 2022.  Management is evaluating the timing of when to apply for a new Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement.  There is no assurance either of these tax arrangements will be granted. Development Agreement with Singapore Tourism Board On August\u00a023, 2006, MBS entered into a development agreement, as amended by a supplementary agreement on December\u00a011, 2009 (the \"Development Agreement\"), with the STB to design, develop, construct and operate the Marina Bay Sands.  The Development Agreement includes a concession for MBS to own and operate a casino within the Integrated Resort.  In addition to the casino, the Integrated Resort includes, among other amenities, a hotel, a retail complex, a convention center and meeting room complex, a theater, restaurants and an art/science museum.  MBS is one of two companies awarded a concession to operate a casino in Singapore. Under the request for proposals to develop an integrated resort at Marina Bay, Singapore, during an initial ten-year exclusive period (the \"Exclusivity Period\") only two licensees were granted the right to operate a casino in Singapore, which expired on February 28, 2017.  This Exclusivity Period was subsequently extended to December 31, 2030, when the Second Development Agreement (see below) was entered into. In connection with entering into the Development Agreement, MBS entered into a 60-year lease with the STB for the parcels underlying the project site and entered into an agreement with the Land Transport Authority of Singapore for the provision of necessary infrastructure for rapid transit systems and road works within and/or outside the project site.  During the Exclusivity Period, the Company, which is currently the 100% indirect shareholder of MBS, was required to be the single largest entity with direct or indirect controlling interest of at least 20% in MBS, unless otherwise approved by the GRA. The term of the casino concession provided under the Development Agreement is for 30\u00a0years commencing from the date the Development Agreement was entered into, or August\u00a023, 2006.  In order to renew the casino concession, MBS must give notice to the STB and other relevant authorities in Singapore at least five years before its expiration in August\u00a02036.  The Singapore government may terminate the casino concession prior to its expiration in order to serve the best interests of the public, in which event fair compensation will be paid to MBS. In April 2019, MBS and the STB entered into the Second Development Agreement pursuant to which MBS has agreed to construct a second large-scale development, the MBS Expansion Project, located adjacent to Marina Bay Sands, comprising of additional MICE facilities, a hotel tower with up to 1,000 rooms and suites, a rooftop attraction, convention and meeting facilities and a state-of-the-art live entertainment arena with approximately 15,000 seats.  The Second Development Agreement provides for a total project cost of approximately SGD 4.5 billion (approximately $3.3 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022).  The amount of the total project cost will be finalized as we complete design and development and begin construction. In connection with the Second Development Agreement, MBS entered into a lease with the STB for the parcels of land underlying the project (the \"Land\").  In April 2019 and in connection with the lease, MBS provided various governmental agencies in Singapore the required premiums, deposits, stamp duty, goods and services tax and other fees in an aggregate amount of approximately SGD 1.54\u00a0billion (approximately $1.14\u00a0billion at exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction).  We amended our 2012 Singapore Credit Facility to provide for the financing of the development and construction costs, fees and other expenses related to the MBS Expansion Project pursuant to the Development Agreement.  On September 7, 2021, MBS entered into an amendment letter to the 2012 Singapore Credit Facility, which among other things, extended the deadline for delivering the construction costs estimate and the construction schedule for the MBS Expansion Project to March 31, 2022.  We are in the process of reviewing the budget and timing of the MBS expansion based on the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other factors. 17 17 17 Table of Contents Table of Contents The Development Agreement contains, among other things, restrictions limiting the use of the leased land to the development and operation of the project, requirements that MBS obtain prior approval from the STB in order to subdivide the hotel and retail components of the project, prohibitions on any such subdivision during the Exclusivity Period and limitations on MBS' ability to assign the lease or sub-lease any portion of the land during the Exclusivity Period.  In addition, the Development Agreement contains events of default, including, among other things, the failure of MBS to perform its obligations under the Development Agreement and events of bankruptcy or dissolution. Employees whose job duties relate to the operations of the casino are required to be licensed by the relevant authorities in Singapore.  MBS also must comply with comprehensive internal control standards or regulations concerning advertising; branch office operations; the location, floor plans and layout of the casino; casino operations including casino-related financial transactions and patron disputes, issuance of credit and collection of debt, relationships with and permitted payments to gaming promoters; security and surveillance; casino access by Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans; compliance functions and the prevention of money laundering; periodic standard and other reports to the GRA; and those relating to social controls including the exclusion of certain persons from the casino. There is a goods and services tax of 7% imposed on gross gaming revenue, which, effective January 1, 2023, increased to 8%, and a casino tax imposed on the gross gaming revenue from the casino after reduction for the amount of goods and services tax.  With effect from March 1, 2022, the casino tax rates of 5% for premium players and 15% for mass players were increased to 8% and 18% on gross gaming revenue up to SGD 2.4\u00a0billion and SGD 3.1\u00a0billion (approximately $1.8\u00a0billion and $2.3\u00a0billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022), respectively.  On gross gaming revenue above the stated thresholds, the new casino tax rates are 12% for premium players and 22% for mass players.  The bad debts written off from the extension of credit granted to gaming patrons is not deductible against gross gaming revenue when calculating the casino tax, but is deductible for the purposes of calculating the goods and services tax (subject to the prevailing law).  MBS is permitted to extend casino credit to persons who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents, but is not permitted to extend casino credit to Singapore citizens or permanent residents except to premium players.  The key constraint imposed on the casino under the Development Agreement is the total size of the gaming area, which must not be more than 15,000 square meters (approximately 161,000 square feet).  The following are not counted towards the gaming area: back of house facilities, reception, restrooms, food and beverage areas, retail shops, stairs, escalators and lift lobbies leading to the gaming area, aesthetic and decorative displays, performance areas and major aisles.  The casino located within Marina Bay Sands may not have more than 2,500 gaming machines, but there is no limit on the number of tables for casino games permitted in the casino. Under the Casino Control Act, as amended (the \"Singapore Act\"), a casino operator may be subject to a financial penalty, for each ground of disciplinary action which amounts to a serious breach, of a sum not exceeding 10% of the annual gross gaming revenue (as defined in the Singapore Act) of the casino operator for the financial year immediately preceding the date the financial penalty is imposed. The Singapore Act also requires future applicants and/or renewals for a casino license to be a suitable person to develop, maintain and promote the Integrated Resort as a compelling tourist destination that meets prevailing market demand and industry standards and contributes to the tourism industry in Singapore.  The Singapore government has established an evaluation panel that will assess applicants and report to the GRA on this aspect of the casino licensing requirements. Our casino license, which has a three-year term, is set to expire in April 2025.   The Second Development Agreement contains provisions relating to the construction of the MBS Expansion Project and associated deadlines for completion, levels of insurance and limitations on MBS\u2019 ability to assign the lease or sub-let any portion of the Land.  In addition, the Second Development Agreement contains events of default, including, among other things, the failure of MBS to perform its obligations under the Second Development Agreement.   The Second Development Agreement also contains, among other things, restrictions limiting the use of the Land to the development and operation of the MBS Expansion Project and requirements that MBS obtain the prior approval of the STB in order to subdivide the Land or any building thereon, which approval, if given, will be subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined by the STB. 18 18 18 Table of Contents Table of Contents The Second Development Agreement makes provision for certain benefits and entitlements conferred on MBS on specified terms and conditions. Among these, upon the achievement of certain milestones, MBS will be entitled to make available an additional 1,000 gaming machines over and above its existing 2,500 gaming machines.  On October 7, 2019, MBS was granted entitlement to make available 500 of these additional 1,000 gaming machines.  In addition, under the Second Development Agreement, MBS is granted approval for the change of use of the area comprising the whole of the 55th floor of MBS\u2019 hotel tower 1, or such other areas as may be agreed within hotel tower 1, to be developed and used as part of MBS\u2019 casino; and MBS is granted an option to purchase an additional 2,000 square meters of casino gaming area at a price to be determined by the relevant Singapore government authority upon written request by MBS to exercise the option.  In addition, the Second Development Agreement contemplates that for a period of not less than 10 years commencing no sooner than March 1, 2022, the rate of casino tax applicable to MBS will not exceed specified tiered rates; there shall not be more than two casino licenses in force under the Casino Control Act at any time prior to January 1, 2031; and for a period of five years from the date of the Second Development Agreement, the entry levy payable by a Singapore citizen or permanent resident for entry into the casino will not exceed SGD 150 for a 24-hour period and SGD 3,000 for a 12-month period.  The Second Development Agreement also provides for MBS to be entitled to compensation by STB for any losses or damages suffered under certain conditions and events related to the above-described benefits and entitlements.  The Second Development Agreement further provides MBS must maintain compliance with the material terms of the Second Development Agreement to obtain the above-described benefits and entitlements. State of Nevada On February 23, 2022, LVSC completed the sale of its Las Vegas real property and operations, including The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center (the \u201cLas Vegas Operations\u201d), to VICI Properties L.P. (\u201cPropCo\u201d), a subsidiary of VICI Properties Inc. and Pioneer OpCo, LLC (\u201cOpCo\u201d), an affiliate of certain funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc., for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.25\u00a0billion (the \u201cLas Vegas Sale\u201d) pursuant to the terms of (a) a Real Estate Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of March 2, 2021, by and between the Company and PropCo and (b) a Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of March 2, 2021, by and among the Company, PropCo and OpCo.  Regulatory approvals related to the Las Vegas Sale were obtained by the Nevada Gaming Authorities (as later defined) on February 2, 2022 and February 17, 2022. LVSC ceased gaming operations in Nevada upon the close of the Las Vegas Sale and the Nevada Board (as later defined) acknowledged the closure of gaming operations on February 22, 2022.  In connection with the closure, the Nevada Gaming Authorities are in the process of conducting the final closing audit of the books and records related to the Las Vegas Operations in the ordinary course.  The Nevada Board retains physical possession of the gaming license until the final audit has been completed.  Given the status of the Las Vegas Operations, the following is only a high-level overview of Nevada gaming regulatory requirements.  The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the \"Nevada Act\") and various local regulations.  Gaming operations in Clark County are also subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission (the \"Nevada Commission\"), the Nevada Gaming Control Board (the \"Nevada Board\") and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board (the \"CCLGLB\" and together with the Nevada Commission and the Nevada Board, the \"Nevada Gaming Authorities\"). The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things: \u2022the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; \u2022the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures; \u2022the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues, providing reliable record-keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities; \u2022the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; and \u2022the establishment of a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees. 19 19 19 Table of Contents Table of Contents Las Vegas Sands, LLC (\"LVSLLC\") was licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities to operate the resort hotel. and was also registered as an intermediary company of Venetian Casino Resort, LLC (\"VCR\").  VCR was licensed as a manufacturer and distributor of gaming devices and as a key employee of LVSLLC. LVSC was registered with the Nevada Commission as a publicly traded corporation. Doing Business in Macao, Hong Kong and Mainland China We are a parent company with limited business operations of our own, and our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries.  A significant portion of our business operations are based in Macao and held by various Macao-incorporated indirect subsidiaries of SCL, our majority-owned subsidiary incorporated in Cayman Islands and listed in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as the \"Macao Operations\").  We also have subsidiaries incorporated in mainland China and Hong Kong that provide back-office support, such as information technology, accounting, hotel management and marketing services, which complement and support SCL\u2019s main back-office functions in Macao. We face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties relating to having a majority of our operations based in Macao and held by various Macao-incorporated indirect subsidiaries of SCL.  Substantially all of SCL\u2019s assets are located in Macao and substantially all of SCL\u2019s revenue is derived from Macao.  Accordingly, our results of operations, financial position and prospects are subject to a significant degree to the economic, political and legal situation in Macao.  From December 20, 1999, Macao became a Special Administrative Region of China when China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Macao.  The Basic Law of Macao provides that Macao will be governed under the principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d with its own separate government and legislature and that Macao will have a high degree of legislative, judicial and economic autonomy.  We also face risks and uncertainties associated with evolving Chinese laws and regulations, such as those associated with the extent to which the level of Chinese government involvement, control of capital inflows and outflows, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources currently applicable within mainland China may become applicable to us and other risks and uncertainties as to whether and how recent Chinese government statements and regulatory developments, such as those relating to data and cyberspace security and anti-monopoly which, where applicable to us, could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless and affect our ability to list securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange.  If, in the future, there were to be a significant change in the manner in which the Chinese government exercises direct or indirect oversight, discretion or control over businesses operated in Macao, mainland China and Hong Kong, including the current interpretation and application of existing Chinese laws and regulations on how the Chinese government exercises direct or indirect oversight, discretion or control over businesses operated in Macao, mainland China and Hong Kong, it could potentially result in our Macao Operations being materially adversely affected and it could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As advised by our PRC legal advisers, Haiwen & Partners, our Macao Operations are currently not required to obtain any permission or approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d), Cyberspace Administration of China (\u201cCAC\u201d) or any other mainland Chinese governmental authority to operate its business or to issue securities to foreign investors, other than those related to its two subsidiaries incorporated in mainland China that only provide back office support.  We have received all requisite permissions and approvals for the back-office supporting functions located in mainland China, primarily being the standard business licenses issued by the relevant authorities in mainland China, and we have never been denied such permissions and approvals.  If we do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals in relation to such back-office support functions, we do not expect there will be any material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In the event that we have inadvertently concluded that such permissions or approvals are not required for our Macao Operations or if, in the future, applicable laws, regulations or interpretations were to change and require us to obtain such permissions or approvals, the failure to obtain such permissions or approvals could potentially result in penalties and other regulatory actions against us and may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, on December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted final amendments implementing the disclosure and submission requirements under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the \u201cHFCA Act\u201d), pursuant to which the SEC will identify a \u201cCommission-Identified Issuer\u201d if an issuer has filed an annual report containing an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  20 20 20 Table of Contents Table of Contents (\"PCAOB\") has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction, and will then impose a trading prohibition on an issuer after it is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for three consecutive years.  If, in the future, we were to be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer and have a \u201cnon-inspection\u201d year, there is no assurance that we will be able to take remedial measures in a timely manner.  On December 29, 2022, the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law, which reduced the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the listing and trading prohibitions under the HFCA Act from three years to two years.  On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB reported that it was able, in 2022, to inspect and investigate completely audit firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and that, as a result, the PCAOB voted to vacate previous determinations to the contrary.  However, uncertainties remain whether the PCAOB can continue to make a determination in the future that it is able to inspect and investigate completely PCAOB-registered audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong. See \"Item 1A. \u2014 Risk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to Doing Business in China\" for more detailed information. Transfers of Cash to and from Our Non-U.S. Subsidiaries We are primarily dependent upon our properties in Macao and Singapore.  We are a parent company with limited business operations of our own, our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries. We conduct most of our business operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries.  Accordingly, our primary sources of cash are royalties, dividends and distributions derived from the earnings and cash flow generated by our operating properties. Our subsidiaries' payments to us will be contingent upon their earnings and upon other business considerations, which may be impacted by various factors. In addition, our Macao and Singapore credit facility agreements, under certain circumstances, may limit or prohibit certain payments of dividends or other distributions to us.  We expect future debt instruments issued by our subsidiaries for the financing of future developments may contain similar restrictions. Subject to applicable law, any future dividend payments will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors, taking into account various factors such as our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors.  There can be no assurance that dividends will be paid in any particular amount, if at all, for any given period. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is reliant to some extent on the dividends received by SCL.  In April 2020, we suspended our quarterly dividend program due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  We will assess the resumption of the dividend program at a time deemed appropriate after taking into account all facts and circumstances. The ability of subsidiaries to make distributions to us depends on the earnings and cash flow generated from gaming operations and various other factors, including dividend requirements to third-party public stockholders in the case of funds being repatriated from SCL, compliance with certain local statutes, the laws and regulations currently and in the future applicable to our subsidiaries and restrictions in connection with their contractual arrangements.  For example, our revenues in Macao are denominated in patacas, the legal currency of Macao, and in Hong Kong dollars.  The Macao pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar and, in many cases, is used interchangeably with the Hong Kong dollar in Macao.  The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar.  While currently there are no foreign exchange or capital control restrictions applicable to intercompany transactions between us and our Macao, Hong Kong and mainland China subsidiaries, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case in the future and that our ability to convert large amounts of patacas into U.S. dollars over a relatively short period will not be limited.  In addition, the mainland Chinese government also imposes controls on the convertibility of the renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China by our subsidiaries incorporated in mainland China.  If, in the future, foreign exchange or capital control restrictions were to be imposed and become applicable to us, such restrictions could potentially reduce the amounts that we would be able to receive from our Macao, Hong Kong and mainland China subsidiaries.  Our non-U.S. subsidiaries, including those located in Singapore, Macao, Hong Kong and mainland China, held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $2.57 billion and restricted cash of $125\u00a0million as of December 31, 2022, of which approximately $2.06\u00a0billion is available to be repatriated, either in the form of dividends or via intercompany loans or advances, to the U.S., subject to the abovementioned restrictions.  We do not expect withholding taxes or other foreign income taxes to apply should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise.  21 21 21 Table of Contents Table of Contents Cash may be transferred between and among the Company and its subsidiaries through capital contributions, intercompany loans or advances, dividends, royalties and transfers of cash and other assets.  The total net transfers to (from) the Company with SCL were $(978)\u00a0million, $42\u00a0million and $739\u00a0million and with Marina Bay Sands were $74\u00a0million, $37\u00a0million and $21\u00a0million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net transfers from SCL to its subsidiaries were $497\u00a0million, $385\u00a0million and $469\u00a0million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, SCL made interest payments to the holders of the SCL Senior Notes in the amount of $310\u00a0million, $352\u00a0million and $294\u00a0million, respectively.  There were no interim principal payments on the SCL Senior Notes. ", "time": "00:00:04"}
