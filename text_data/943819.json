{"cik": 943819, "item_1A": "ITEM 1 BUSINESS General We are a global leader in digital health and cloud-connected medical devices. We design innovative solutions to treat and keep people out of the hospital, empowering them to live healthier, higher-quality lives. Our digital health technologies and cloud-connected medical devices transform care for people with sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and other chronic diseases. Our comprehensive out-of-hospital software platforms support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. By enabling better care, our products improve quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease, and lower costs for consumers and healthcare systems. Following our formation in 1989, we commercialized a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA. This treatment, continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, was the first successful noninvasive treatment for OSA. CPAP systems deliver pressurized air, typically through a mask, to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Since the development of CPAP, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of innovative products and solutions for a broad range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, and dental devices. We offer a comprehensive digital solution suite for patients with COPD or asthma, including those using inhalers, as well as non-invasive or invasive ventilation. In addition, we are a leading provider of cloud-based health applications, software and devices designed to provide connected care, enabling clinicians to manage more patients efficiently and effectively, as well as enabling and encouraging patients\u2019 long-term adherence to and satisfaction with their therapy. We also provide management software to agencies providing out-of-hospital care, including  -1- -1- -1- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC.

Corporate History Our Australian subsidiary, ResMed Holdings Limited, was originally organized in 1989 by Dr. Peter Farrell to acquire from Baxter Center for Medical Research Pty Limited, or Baxter, the rights to certain technology relating to CPAP treatment as well as Baxter\u2019s existing CPAP device business. Baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 and sold CPAP devices in Australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business. ResMed Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in March 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries. In June 1995, we completed an initial public offering of common stock and our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ National Market. In September 1999, we transferred our principal listing to the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, trading under the ticker symbol \u201cRMD\u201d. In November 1999, we established a secondary listing of our common stock via Chess Depositary Instruments, or CDIs, on the Australian Stock Exchange (now known as the Australian Securities Exchange), or ASX, also under the symbol \u201cRMD\u201d. Ten CDIs on the ASX represent one share of our common stock on the NYSE.  Since formation we have acquired a number of businesses, including distributors, suppliers, developers of medical equipment and related technologies, and software solution providers. For example, in the United States our sleep and respiratory care products are sold by ResMed Corp. and our software is sold principally by our Brightree and MatrixCare subsidiaries. Segment Information  We operate in two segments, which are the Sleep and Respiratory Care segment and the Software as a Service, or SaaS, segment. See Note 13 \u2013 Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The Market We are focused on sleep and related respiratory care, both of which we believe are globally underpenetrated, and where we believe our products can improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers, help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and reduce overall healthcare system costs. Additionally, our software solutions are focused on out-of-hospital care, which we believe is fragmented and underserved, and where we see significant opportunity to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare through a strategy of enabling better patient care, improving clinical decision support, and driving interoperability across out-of-hospital care settings. Sleep and Respiratory Care Sleep Sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states: rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep and non-rapid eye movement, or non-REM, sleep. REM sleep, which is about 20-25% of total sleep experienced by adults, is characterized by a high level of brain activity, bursts of rapid eye movement, increased heart and respiration rates, and paralysis of many muscles. Non-REM sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth; stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest. -2- -2- -2- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES The upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles. Normally, during REM sleep and deeper levels of non-REM sleep, upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows. Individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep, called apneas, and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas. These breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration, causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond. Typically, the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep, causing the throat muscles to contract, opening the airway. After a few gasping breaths, blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself. Sufferers of OSA typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour. While these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep, the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions. OSA has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. A long-term epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26% of adults age 30-70 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea. Another study published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine in 2019 estimated that mild to severe OSA impacts more than 936 million people worldwide, including 54 million Americans. Of those impacted, it was estimated that more than 424 million would have moderate to severe sleep apnea. Despite the high prevalence of OSA, there is a general lack of awareness of OSA among both the medical community and the general public. It is estimated that less than 20% of those with OSA have been diagnosed or treated. Many healthcare professionals often do not diagnose OSA because they are unaware that such non-specific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, snoring, hypertension, and irritability are characteristic of OSA. While sleep apnea has been diagnosed in a broad cross-section of the population, until recently, it has typically been diagnosed among middle-aged men who are obese. However, we believe the importance of sleep apnea in women is increasingly being recognized, with nearly 40% of new PAP patients being female. A strong association has been discovered between sleep apnea and a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Studies have shown that sleep apnea is present in approximately 83% of patients with drug-resistant hypertension, approximately 77% of patients with obesity, approximately 76% of patients with chronic heart failure, and approximately 72% of patients with type 2 diabetes. A study presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress in 2021 and later published in CHEST in 2022 found that using PAP therapy as directed can significantly increase sleep apnea patients\u2019 chances of living longer. The study concluded that people with obstructive sleep apnea who continued PAP therapy were 39% more likely to survive over a three-year period than OSA patients who did not. Researchers found that the survival rate gap remained significant when accounting for patients\u2019 ages, overall health, other pre-existing conditions, and causes of death. Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Sleep-disordered breathing, or SDB, encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep. Manifestations include OSA, central sleep apnea, or CSA, and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep. Hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity, chronic obstructive lung disease, and neuromuscular disease. OSA is the most common form of SDB. Sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by OSA can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, reduced cognitive function, including memory loss and lack of concentration, depression, and irritability. OSA sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas. Several studies demonstrate that the oxygen desaturation, increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by OSA may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina, stroke, and heart attack. Patients with OSA have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem- solving, response speed, and visual motor coordination, and studies have linked OSA to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents. Generally, an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of OSA is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation. The diagnosis of OSA typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient\u2019s home. During overnight testing, respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored, along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Simpler tests, using devices such as our ApneaLink Air, NightOwl, or our automatic positive airway pressure devices, monitor airflow during sleep, and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns. These tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas, hypopneas, or subconscious awakenings.  -3- -3- -3- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Before 1981, the primary treatment for OSA was a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient\u2019s windpipe. Alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and streamline the shape of the airway or implant a device to add support to the soft palate. UPPP alone has a poor success rate; however, when performed in conjunction with multi-stage upper airway surgical procedures, a greater success rate has been claimed. These combined procedures, performed by highly specialized surgeons, are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods. Surgical treatments are not considered first-line therapy for OSA. Other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery, mandibular advancement surgery, dental appliances, palatal implants, somnoplasty, nasal devices, and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles. Alternative pharmaceutical therapy treatments are reported to be under development. A variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of OSA. Most are only partially effective, but CPAP is a reliable treatment for all severities of OSA and is considered first-line therapy. Use of mandibular advancement devices is increasingly used as a second-line option in patients unable to use CPAP or those with mild OSA. These devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway. CPAP is a non-invasive means of treating OSA. CPAP was first used as a treatment for OSA in 1980 by Dr. Colin Sullivan, the past Chairman of our Medical Advisory Board, and was commercialized for treatment of OSA in the United States, or U.S., in the mid-1980s. During CPAP treatment, a patient sleeps with an interface connected to a small portable air device that delivers room air at a positive pressure. The patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface. Continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed. Interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows. Sometimes, when a patient leaks air through their mouth, a full-face mask may need to be used, rather than a nasal interface. CPAP is not a cure and, therefore, must be used nightly as long as treatment is required. Patient compliance has been a major factor in the effectiveness of CPAP treatment. Early generations of CPAP units provided limited patient comfort and convenience. Patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the CPAP device operating at the prescribed pressure. In recent years, product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed. These include more comfortable patient interface systems; delay timers that gradually increase air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily; bilevel air devices, including our AirCurve 10 Series and Lumis devices, which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation; heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable; and auto-titration devices that modulate the average pressure delivered during the night. Respiratory Care Our aim is to provide respiratory care solutions to patients with COPD, asthma, and other chronic respiratory diseases, such as overlap syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or OHS, and neuromuscular disease, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. We aim to improve patient quality of life, slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management. Our products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Our devices are predominantly used in the home and, to a lesser extent, in general hospital wards and respiratory wards. We supply CPAP and bilevel device systems, high flow therapy device systems (HFT), non-invasive and invasive ventilators, humidifiers, and accessories, including masks, nasal cannula, and tubing. We also provide data management systems designed to improve the management of patients. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. COPD encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation, prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs. It is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways. Symptoms encountered with COPD include shortness of breath as well as chronic cough and increased sputum production. COPD includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. A recent study based on recent epidemiology data estimates that there are approximately 480 million people worldwide who suffer from COPD, the world\u2019s third leading cause of death. Patients with COPD can have different clinical presentations. Patients with chronic bronchitis present with low level of oxygen (hypoxemia) and elevated levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia), a chronic productive cough, cor pulmonale, and are commonly overweight. Patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases, are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity. During sleep, chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia. In general,  -4- -4- -4- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES the more hypoxic a COPD patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep. Hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in COPD patients and is more pronounced in REM sleep. Some COPD patients may also suffer from comorbid OSA, a condition known as Overlap Syndrome. Home non-invasive ventilation has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with the management of patients with severe COPD by significantly increasing the time between hospital readmissions. Early research also suggests that home HFT may help improve clinical outcomes in hypoxemic COPD patients that frequently have exacerbations. Overlap Syndrome. In patients with COPD-OSA Overlap Syndrome, CPAP has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality, decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange. Non-invasive ventilation, or NIV, has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing. It may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays, as well as reducing complicating factors such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. In patients with stable COPD, the advantages of home NIV are less clear, but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnea scores and health-related quality-of-life measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays. Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. OHS is characterized by the combination of obesity, chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and sleep apnea after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation. An estimated 90% of patients with OHS also have OSA. In patients with OHS, positive airway therapy, both CPAP and NIV, has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive.  Neuromuscular Disease. Neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly (via intrinsic muscle pathology) or indirectly (via nerve pathology) impair the functioning of muscles. Symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue, dysphagia, dyspnoea on exertion and at rest, sleepiness, morning headache, difficulties with concentration, and mood changes. Most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation, being wheelchair-bound, swallowing difficulties, respiratory muscle weakness, and, eventually, death from respiratory failure. Neuromuscular disorders can progress rapidly or slowly. Rapidly progressive conditions, such as ALS and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers, are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years. Variable or slowly progressive conditions, such as myotonic muscular dystrophy, are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy.  NIV treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases. In ALS patients, NIV treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures, sleep-related symptoms and survival. Studies have demonstrated that patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may improve in quality of life measures and may increase chance of survival with NIV treatment. Software as a Service Due to multiple acquisitions, including Brightree in April 2016, HEALTHCAREfirst in July 2018, MatrixCare in November 2018, and MEDIFOX DAN in November 2022, our operations now include software platforms that comprise our SaaS business. Our SaaS strategy is to develop a portfolio that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME) providers, and other long-term care providers operate more effectively and efficiently across various out-of-hospital care settings. With a comprehensive set of software and services offerings, our SaaS solutions enable providers to streamline workflow and deliver an improved patient experience across our existing vertical markets including HME and home infusion, facility-based organizations including skilled nursing, senior living, and life plan communities, home health and hospice providers, and to adjacent providers through a growing portfolio of value-added solutions with broad applicability. Our offerings can help providers perform analytics, manage documentation and implement new reimbursement requirements as well as more effectively transfer data as patients move between different care settings.  Business Strategy We believe the treatment of sleep apnea and respiratory care will continue to grow due to a number of factors, including increasing awareness of OSA, CSA and COPD; improved understanding of the role of sleep apnea treatment in the management of cardiac, neurologic, metabolic, and related disorders; improved understanding of the role of non-invasive ventilation in the management of COPD; and an increase in the use of digital and product technology to improve patient  -5- -5- -5- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES outcomes and create efficiencies for customers and providers. Our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sleep apnea and respiratory care, as well as growth in out-of-hospital care settings, consists of the following key elements: \u2022Continue Product Development and Innovation in Sleep Apnea and Respiratory Care Products. We are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea. We have been a leading innovator of products designed to treat sleep apnea more effectively, increase patient comfort,  convenience, and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy. We have introduced a full suite of masks in our AirFit and AirTouch and other ranges, and we offer advanced and expanded integrations of our therapy-based software solutions, including AirView, to promote greater patient adherence to therapy. Our acquisitions have included adding a portfolio of sleep apnea products such as through our acquisition of Curative Medical in 2015. Likewise, we are committed to ongoing innovation of our respiratory care products that serve the needs of patients with COPD and neuromuscular diseases, providing advanced and expanded integrations of our therapy-based software solutions including AirView for Respiratory Care, enabling clinicians to remotely monitor patients on some ventilation devices and bilevel devices. We also acquired a digital health platform for inhalers through our acquisition of Propeller Health in 2019, rounding out our portfolio to treat COPD patients through their therapy journey across different stages of their disease. \u2022Broaden our digital health technology foundation. Digital enablement is central to our strategy. Our cloud-based digital health applications, along with our devices, are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers, allowing fewer professionals to manage more patients and empowering patients to track their own health outcomes. We are expanding our cloud-based patient management and engagement platforms, such as AirView, enabling remote monitoring, over-the-air trouble shooting and changing of device settings, U-Sleep enabling automated patient coaching through a text, email or interactive voice phone call and myAir, a patient engagement application that provides sleep coaching and a daily score based on users' sleep data. In the United States we have released ResMed MaskSelector, an easy-to-use digital tool to make ResMed mask selection and sizing easier for patients and more effective for providers.    We believe that the combination of continued product development, product and technology acquisitions and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success. Approximately 17% of our employees are devoted to research and development activities.  \u2022Expand SaaS Solutions in Out-of-Hospital Care Settings. Our vision is to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital (OOH) healthcare through a strategy of enabling better patient care, improving clinical decision support, and driving interoperability across out-of-hospital healthcare settings. Since acquiring Brightree in 2016, plus MatrixCare and HEALTHCAREfirst in 2018, we offer software solutions across multiple out-of-hospital healthcare settings including HME, home health and hospice, skilled nursing, life plan communities, senior living, and private duty. Our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN in 2022, expanded ResMed\u2019s SaaS business outside of the U.S. to Germany, and added new out-of-hospital care sectors to the business\u2019 ecosystem, including outpatient therapy. We are connecting capabilities across the platforms in these out-of-hospital care settings to help our customers be more efficient, better serve people, keep them out-of-hospital, and in lower-cost, higher-quality care settings. Today, our SaaS solutions serve out of hospital providers combining over 139 million individual patient accounts. \u2022Expand Geographic Presence. We offer our products in more than 140 countries to sleep clinics, home healthcare dealers, patients and third-party payors. We intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal geographies, as well as expand the depth of our presence in other high-growth geographic regions. In 2015, we acquired Curative Medical to invest in China and expand our growth potential in sleep apnea, COPD and respiratory care there. In 2019, we acquired HB Healthcare, a privately owned HME that serves both reimbursed and cash-pay customers of sleep and respiratory care devices in South Korea. In 2021, we acquired Tong-il, another leading sleep and respiratory care HME provider in South Korea, reinforcing both our commitment and capability to serve millions of South Korean patients living with sleep apnea, COPD, and other chronic respiratory diseases. \u2022Increase Public and Clinical Awareness. We continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sleep apnea, COPD, and other clinical conditions that can be treated with our industry-leading solutions. These promotional activities target both the population predisposed to sleep apnea and medical specialists, such as pulmonologists, sleep medicine specialists, primary care physicians, cardiologists,  -6- -6- -6- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES neurologists, and other medical subspecialists who treat these conditions and their associated comorbidities. We target special interest groups, including the National Stroke Association, the American Heart Association, COPD Foundation, and the National Sleep Foundation, to further increase awareness of the relationship between OSA, COPD, neuromuscular disease, and comorbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. The programs also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety, especially in the transport industry. We have helped establish a center for clinical care and medical research at the University of California, San Diego, in the fields of sleep apnea and COPD.  \u2022Expand into New Clinical Applications. We continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. Studies have established a clinical association between OSA and both stroke and chronic heart failure and have recognized sleep apnea as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure. Research also indicates that sleep apnea is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Additionally, research supported by ResMed has demonstrated that the addition of non-invasive ventilation to patients with severe COPD who are receiving oxygen therapy provides meaningful clinical benefits to the patient and the broader healthcare system. We maintain close working relationships with prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology. \u2022Leverage the Experience of our Management Team. Our senior team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general, and in the fields of sleep apnea, respiratory care and healthcare informatics in particular. We intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and solutions and to increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sleep apnea and the use of non-invasive ventilation, and in-home life-support ventilation to treat COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases. Products Our portfolio of products includes devices, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, and cloud-based software and informatics solutions. For purposes of the following discussion, we refer to our air flow generators and ventilators collectively as devices. Devices We produce cloud-connected CPAP, automatic positive airway pressure, or APAP, bilevel, adaptive servo-ventilation, or ASV, and HFT devices that deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface, either a mask or cannula. Our APAP, devices, known as AutoSet, are based on a patented technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis, treatment and management of OSA in some countries. During fiscal year 2017, we launched AirMini, a small portable CPAP combining the same proven therapy modes used in the AirSense 10 with waterless humidification enabling portable convenience. During fiscal year 2021, we launched our new platform of connected CPAP and APAP devices, AirSense 11, which introduced new features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy, and digital enhancements, such as over-the-air update capabilities. Devices in total accounted for approximately 54%, 52%, and 50% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. -7- -7- -7- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC.

Product Development and Clinical Trials  We have a strong track record of innovation in the sleep and respiratory care markets. In 1989, we introduced our first CPAP device. Since then, we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development. Currently, our product development and clinical trial efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings and usability, but also expanding into new digital product applications.  -9- -9- -9- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES We continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. Sleep apnea is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue and irritability. Studies have established a clinical association between untreated sleep apnea and systemic hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and mortality.  Across the sleep and respiratory care platforms, we support clinical trials in many countries including the United States, Germany, Netherlands, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, China, Spain, Canada, Singapore, and Australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology. We also continue to support some of the largest sleep apnea studies in history by performing advanced statistical analyses on millions of real-world, de-identified, clinical data points collected through our cloud-connected devices and patient engagement tools. These studies provide clinical insights around patient management, device settings, and predictors of patient adherence that inform our product development efforts. Some of the more recent real-world studies point to a link between PAP adherence and lower health care resource utilization. We consult with physicians at major medical centers throughout the world to identify clinical and technological trends in the treatment of sleep apnea, COPD, and the other conditions associated with these diseases. New product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff, direct sales force, and clinicians. Sales and Marketing  We currently market our products in more than 140 countries through a network of distributors and direct sales staff. We attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each major geography, often based on regional awareness of sleep apnea as a health problem, physician referral patterns, consumer preferences, and local reimbursement policies. See Note 13 \u2013 Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information about our geographic areas. United States, Canada, and Latin America. Our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient. The decision to purchase our products, as opposed to those of our competitors, is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations: prescribing practitioners; home healthcare dealers; insurers (both private and public); and patients. In the United States, Canada, and Latin America, our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives, program development specialists and regional sales directors. Our field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout the United States, Canada, and Latin America.  We also directly educate physicians and sleep clinics about our products. Patients who are diagnosed with OSA or another respiratory condition and prescribed our products are typically referred by the diagnosing physician or sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription. The home healthcare dealer, in consultation with the referring practitioner, will assist the patient in selecting the equipment, fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the device pressure to the prescribed level.  Our SaaS solutions are sold to providers of healthcare in various out-of-hospital settings. We market and sell our Brightree business management software and service solutions to providers in the United States. Our primary markets are HME, pharmacy, home infusion, orthotics and prosthetics. Our sales activities for Brightree products are conducted through a sales organization made up of strategic account managers, sales engineers and sales directors. We develop, market, and sell our MatrixCare care management and related ancillary solutions to providers in the U.S. and our primary customers are senior living; skilled nursing; life plan communities; home health, home care, and hospice agencies as well as related accountable care organizations. Our MatrixCare management solutions are primarily sold through direct sales and ancillary solutions are sold both through direct sales and channel sellers. Combined Europe, Asia, and other markets. We market our products in most major countries in combined Europe, Asia and other geographies. We have wholly owned subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. We use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in combined Europe, Asia, and other regions. We select independent distributors in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sleep apnea therapy. In countries where we sell our products direct, a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales. In many countries, we sell our products to home healthcare dealers or hospitals who then sell the products to the patients. In Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, we also operate home healthcare businesses, providing products and services directly to patients.  -10- -10- -10- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES We only sell our SaaS products in the United States and Germany.  Manufacturing  We operate a globally distributed manufacturing network designed to optimize quality, control costs, reduce time to market for new product introduction, and generate supply chain resilience. Our manufacturing operations consist of specialist component production as well as technical assembly and testing of our devices, masks, and accessories. Of the numerous raw materials, parts and components purchased for our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products, many are available from multiple vendors. We also purchase uniquely configured components from various suppliers, including some who are single-source suppliers for us. Any reduction or halt in supply from one of these suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified. We generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received. We strive for continuous improvement in manufacturing processes to deliver year-on-year improvement in output, cost, and product quality. Each manufacturing site and team are responsible for the quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures, including customer feedback.  The most disruptive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are largely behind us. We continue to be impacted, however, by supply constraints on certain raw materials and electronic components, including semiconductor chips. These constraints have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to manufacture products in quantities necessary to satisfy customer demand, which could negatively impact our results of operations. We are actively working to mitigate the impact of supply constraints by multi-sourcing and qualifying alternate materials. Our quality management system is based upon the requirements of ISO 9001, ISO 13485, FDA Quality System Regulation for Medical Devices, European Medical Device Regulation (\u201cMDR\u201d), the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell. Our main manufacturing sites are certified to ISO 13485 and are audited at regular intervals by a Notified Body. Additionally, our Sydney, Tuas, San Diego, Atlanta, and Moreno Valley sites are certified under the Medical Device Single Audit Program or MDSAP, an audit of medical device manufacturers\u2019 quality management system to satisfy multiple regulatory requirements. MDSAP audits are conducted by a MDSAP recognized auditing organization and can fulfill the needs of multiple regulatory jurisdictions (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and the United States of America). Our Sydney manufacturing operation operates an Environmental Management System (EMS) certified to ISO 14001:2015. We are progressively extending the EMS across our manufacturing network. Our main manufacturing facilities for ResMed-branded products are located in Tuas, Singapore; Sydney, Australia; Chatsworth, California; Johor Bahru, Malaysia; and Atlanta, Georgia. The principal factory for our Curative-branded products is in Suzhou, China. Our Narval-branded products are manufactured in Lyon, France. Refer to Item 2 for additional details on these properties. We will continue to expand and balance volume across our network to meet scale, cost, resilience, and environmental performance objectives, and to meet the needs of customers and patients. Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement The cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs. In Germany and Korea, we receive payments directly from these payors. While we do not generally receive direct payments for our products from payors in other countries, our success depends on the ability of patients to obtain coverage and our customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from those payors.  In the United States, our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers, health systems, or sleep clinics, who invoice third-party payors directly for reimbursement. Domestic third-party payors include government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid and commercial health insurance plans. These payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods, or is experimental, or not deemed reasonable and necessary. The long-term trend towards cost-containment, through managed healthcare, or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare, could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products. In some foreign markets, such as France, Germany, and Japan, government reimbursement is currently available for the purchase or rental of our products, subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In Australia, China, and some other foreign countries, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat OSA. -11- -11- -11- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Healthcare reform in the United States continues to bring significant changes to the third-party payor landscape. The DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program was mandated by Congress through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, implemented the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) competitive bidding program, which included DME that we manufacture and develop, specifically, CPAP and respiratory assist devices (or bilevel devices), and related supplies and accessories. CMS is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years and to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in non-competitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices. The implementation of the competitive bidding program has resulted in reduced Medicare payment for CPAP and respiratory assist devices, and related supplies and accessories in both competitive bidding areas and non-competitive bidding areas. The last round of competitive bid contracts lapsed, effective January 1, 2019. CMS then removed 13 product categories, including CPAP and respiratory assist devices (or bilevel devices), from the Round 2021 Competitive Bidding Program competition. As a result, these products are currently subject to a temporary gap period during which any Medicare-enrolled DMEPOS supplier may furnish DMEPOS items and services to patients. CMS stated in rulemaking that it will be paying the single payment amounts established during the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program updated by an inflation adjustment factor on an annual basis for products furnished in the competitive bidding areas. CMS will start bidding for the next round of the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program after the agency completes the formal public notice and comment rulemaking process.  In non-competitive bidding and non-rural areas, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act mandated that the fee schedule amounts for certain items furnished in rural and non-contiguous non-competitive bidding areas be based on a 50/50 blend of adjusted and unadjusted fee schedule amounts through the duration of the Public Health Emergency (PHE). Through final rulemaking in December 2021, CMS finalized policy that they will continue paying suppliers the 50/50 blend of adjusted and unadjusted fee schedule rates for furnishing items and services in rural and non-contiguous areas regardless of the PHE. The CARES Act also required payment in non-competitively bid areas other than rural or non-contiguous areas be based on a 75/25 blend of adjusted and unadjusted fee schedule amounts through the duration of the PHE, which ended on May 11, 2023. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, requires that this 75/25 blended payment in non-competitively bid areas other than rural or non-contiguous areas continue beyond the end of PHE, through December 31, 2023.  Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, resulted in reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 but were subject to a temporary suspension. The Protecting Medicare and American Farmers From Sequester Cuts Act was signed into law December 10, 2021. The law extended the 2% Medicare sequester moratorium through March 31, 2022, adjusted the sequester to 1% between April 1, 2022, and June 30, 2022, and reinstated the full 2% sequestration cut which began on July 1, 2022, and is extended through the first six months of 2032. The payment reduction applicable to healthcare providers applies to the approved Medicare payment amount, after the deductible and coinsurance are applied. The reduction in payment does not affect the 20% coinsurance owed by the patient. The legislative landscape is complex, and changes with the influence of one party or the other. We expect that the ACA, these new laws and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our products and services. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations. Service and Warranty  We generally offer either one-year or two-year limited warranties on our devices. In some regions and for certain customers we also offer extended warranties on our devices for one to three years in addition to our limited warranty. Warranties on mask systems are typically 90 days. Our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement. We receive returns of our products from the field  -12- -12- -12- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES for various reasons. We believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices. We provide for warranties and returns based on historical data.  Competition Global competition for sales of our products and services is intense. We believe that the principal competitive factors are product features, value-added solutions, quality, reliability and price. Customer support, reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors. We compete in various geographies, each with different competitors, and some of our competitors are affiliates of our customers, which may make it difficult to compete with them.  Our primary Sleep and Respiratory Care competitors include Philips BV; Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited; DeVilbiss Healthcare; Apex Medical Corporation; BMC Medical Co. Ltd.; React Health Corporation; and Lowenstein plus regional and new-entrant manufacturers. Finally, our products compete with surgical procedures, nerve stimulation devices, and dental appliances designed to treat OSA and other sleep apnea-related respiratory conditions. The development of new or innovative procedures, devices, or therapies, such as pharmaceuticals, by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, which would harm our revenues and financial condition. For our SaaS business, competition is also intense, rapidly evolving, and subject to changing technology, low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many of our customers use systems developed in-house to run their businesses.  The development of new or innovative solutions by others could result in our solutions becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, which would harm our revenues and financial condition. Any product developed by us will have to compete for market acceptance and sales. An important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products and solutions. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products and solutions, complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes, and provide commercial supply of products and solutions to the market are important competitive factors. In addition, our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property.  Patents and Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation  We rely on a combination of patents, designs, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights. Some of these patents, patent applications, and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products. We believe the combination of these rights, in aggregate, are of material importance to each of our businesses. Through our various subsidiaries, as of the date of this report, we own or have licensed rights to approximately 9,700 pending, allowed or granted patents and designs. Patents and designs have various statutory terms based on the legislation in individual jurisdictions which may be subject to change. Of our patents, 619 U.S. patents and 1,472 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years. We believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position. Litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our rights, or to defend third-party claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others. The defense and prosecution of patent claims, including pending claims, as well as participation in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time-consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us. Patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country. We have in the past, and may in the future, be required to license patents and other intellectual property rights owned by other parties. Therefore, there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits. Government Regulations  FDA Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulation, and related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, marking, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for such products, in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the  -13- -13- -13- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES FDA is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution.  Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance, a premarket approval, or PMA, or a de novo approval, and pay a user fee, before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device, as well as whether or not a similar or \u201cpredicate\u201d device exists to support a 510(k) application. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Certain SaaS applications may be classified as a medical device. Our devices currently marketed in the United States are marketed pursuant to 510(k) pre-marketing clearances and are either Class I or Class II devices. Certain of our SaaS products may be classified as medical devices requiring a pre-marketing clearance or approval while other SaaS products may not be medical devices or will be commercialized under FDA\u2019s current policy of enforcement discretion. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and may require clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a predecessor device that was (a) legally marketed in the U.S. before the 1976 Medical Device Amendments that established the 510(k) pathway or (b) brought to market after 1976 pursuant to the 510(k) pathway. Such a predecessor device is referred to as \u201cpredicate device.\u201d Devices that do not have such a predicate are typically classified as Class III by default and are required to undergo the stringent PMA pathway that includes provision of clinical evidence and trials. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and require the submission of extensive performance and clinical information. However, a sponsor may apply to the FDA to reclassify devices that do not have predicates to Class I or II if the device is of low to moderate risk. If the FDA grants the application, such a device is termed a \u201cde novo\u201d device and is evaluated through the somewhat more flexible de novo approval pathway. As a result, FDA clearance and approval requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. Finally, there may be instances where the products we sell as a result of an acquisition are subject to further FDA review and clearance. Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new or approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device\u2019s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until clearance or approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require, manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant clearance or approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions. We believe that our design, manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements.  We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting or MDR requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to  -14- -14- -14- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as \u201coff-label\u201d promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution. Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country.  EEA In the European Economic Area, (which is comprised of the 27 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), or EEA, medical devices need to comply with specific requirements. These requirements were previously known as \u201cEssential Requirements\u201d under the former EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or MDD) and are now defined \u201cGeneral Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR)\u201d under the new EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745, or MDR). While the requirements set forth in the MDR are generally consistent with those laid out in the MDD (with a few exceptions), the GSPR are described more in detail compared to the Essential Requirements. Compliance with the Essential Requirements (under the MDD) or the GSPR (under the MDR) is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE marking to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements/GSPR and affix the CE marking, manufacturers of medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements/GSPR, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is a third-party organization designated by a competent authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would audit and examine the Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements/GSPR. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE marking to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the Essential Requirements/GSPR must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence.  All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EEA must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under the MDR, incidents must be reported centrally in the European EUDAMED database (although transitional provisions are in place until EUDAMED is fully functional), and manufacturers are required to take Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, to prevent or reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use. The MDR considers \u201cserious incidents\u201d those incidents which, directly or indirectly, led, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons, a serious deterioration in their state of health, or a serious public health threat. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. Where appropriate, our products commercialized in Europe are CE marked and classified as either Class I or Class II.  -15- -15- -15- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the MDR, which repeals and replaces the MDD. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member states, the regulations would be directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them) in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR), applicable as of May 26, 2022, provides for the regulatory framework applicable to in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The MDR was meant to become applicable three years after publication (in May 2020). However, on April 23, 2020, to allow EEA national authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers and other actors to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Council and Parliament adopted Regulation 2020/561, postponing the date of application of the MDR by one year. The MDR thus became applicable on May 26, 2021. The MDR transitional provisions allow the placing on the market of devices with a CE Certificate issued in accordance with the MDD until May 26, 2024, under certain conditions. Moreover, the MDR provides that the following medical devices with a CE Certificate issued in accordance with the MDD may continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025.  \u2022Devices placed on the market in compliance with the MDD prior to May 26, 2021; and \u2022Devices placed on the market after May 26, 2021, benefiting from the described MDR transitional provisions.  The European Commission further extended provision of the MDR and IVDR through Regulation (EU) 2023/607, whereby manufacturers and notified bodies are given sufficiently more time to carry out, in accordance with the MDR, the conformity assessment of devices covered by a certificate or a declaration of conformity issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC. Moreover, the deletion of the \u2018sell off\u2019 date in the MDR and the IVDR aims to prevent unnecessary disposal of safe devices. These provisions extend the transition period of devices through to December 31, 2027 or December 31, 2028 depending on device risk classification. The MDR, among other things: \u2022strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance once they are available; \u2022establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; \u2022improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; \u2022sets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and \u2022strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market. We have received certification at several locations, including Sydney, Australia; San Diego, California; and Lyon, France. We continue to transition our certification profile to meet the new MDR requirements. Other regulatory bodies Our devices are sold in multiple countries and often need to be registered with local regulatory bodies such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, Health Canada in Canada and CFDA in China.  Other Healthcare Laws We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims and transparency laws with respect to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us. -16- -16- -16- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute that prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Due to the breadth of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Congress set forth certain exceptions and authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to issue regulations that set forth certain safe harbors to protect arrangements that while implicating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, would generally not cause harm to federal health care programs or patients. Satisfaction of all elements of a particular Anti-Kickback Statute statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor will provide immunity from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute to the parties to such remunerative arrangement. Failure to satisfy all elements of an exception or safe harbor, however, does not necessarily lead to a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Because the Anti-Kickback Statute is an intent-based statute, each arrangement is subject to a facts and circumstances analysis to determine whether the requisite intent under the statute is present. The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes \u201cany request or demand\u201d for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Private suits filed under the civil False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government. These individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines, judgement, or settlement. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of items or services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities.  The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, biologicals, and medical devices or supplies that require premarket approval by or notification to the FDA, and for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, to report annually to CMS information related to (i) payments and other transfers of value to teaching hospitals, physicians (as defined by statute) and, as of 2022, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and other practitioners, and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by such providers and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS.  The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation. Also, many U.S. states and countries outside the U.S. have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under government programs. In addition, in the U.S., certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. -17- -17- -17- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES FCPA and Other Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries, either directly or through our contracted distributors. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Data Privacy and Security Laws Under HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations, including the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules, to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities and their business associates, as well as covered subcontractors. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties for each violation. In addition to federal privacy and security regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of personal information that are applicable to our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, effective on January 1, 2020, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the \u201cCCPA\u201d), was the first of a series of state privacy laws designed to provide California residents expanded rights with regard to their personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for \u201cprotected health information\u201d maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. CCPA\u2019s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Further, since 2020, approximately ten U.S. states have adopted\u2014and other states are proposing to adopt\u2014 their own comprehensive data protection laws, with varying implementation dates starting January 1, 2023. The application of the laws and the requirements contained therein is not uniform. Although the majority of the state laws exclude business data, we may be required to undertake additional compliance investment and potentially change our business processes to evaluate the application of these laws to our business and to implement compliance measures. If we are subject to or affected by HIPAA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition.  In addition to these comprehensive data protection laws, to date, at least three states have adopted laws specifically regulating the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of biometrics, and additional states are seeking to regulate\u2014and/or restrict the use of\u2014biometrics in the future. Certain of our products use, or permit the use of, information that could be classified as a biometric under these or other laws. If we are subject to or affected by these or other laws, we may be required to modify the way in which we make available our product or certain features of our product. We also may be required to implement additional practices or processes or otherwise invest our resources to comply with these and other regulations.  In some of our operations, such as those involving our cloud-based software digital health applications, we are a business associate under HIPAA and therefore are required to comply with the HIPAA Security Rule, Breach Notification Rule and certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as well as the terms of our business associate agreements that we enter into with our covered entity customers, and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so. -18- -18- -18- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Table of Contents PART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES In addition, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in May 2018. The United Kingdom has adopted the UK General Data Protection Regulation (\"UK GDPR\"); the EU GDPR and UK GDPR are herein referred to as GDPR. The GDPR imposes stringent data protection requirements for the processing of personal data, whenever GDPR applies to such processing, such as processing in the European Economic Area (EEA), or in the UK. The GDPR increased our obligations, for example, by requiring more robust disclosures to individuals, strengthening individual data rights, instituting procedures for mandatory data breach notifications to regulators within a short timeframe, limiting retention periods and secondary use of information (including for research purposes), increasing requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data and imposing additional obligations when we contract with third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or UK, including to the United States; recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity regarding such transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States. For example, the European Commission and the United Kingdom have adopted new standard contractual clauses under which entities may transfer personal data from the European Union and the United Kingdom, which we may be required to implement. We must evaluate such data transfers on a case-by-case basis to ensure continued permissibility under current law and consistent with new standard contractual clauses. GDPR provides that EEA member states and the UK may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. EEA member states and the UK may modify or impose additional conditions to be able to transmit electronic marketing communications. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the EEA member states may result in fines of up to \u20ac20.0 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties as well as individual claims for compensation.  Further, the UK GDPR also provides for significant data protection fines up to the greater of \u00a317.5 million or 4% of global turnover. Numerous other state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information and other personal information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. All 50 states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and states\u2019 Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. These laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies. The FTC also has focused on the use of online tracking technologies that collect personal information as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential bias in AI as one of its enforcement and policy priorities, including the use of both online tracking tools and AI in the healthcare space. Our services and products may use AI now or in the future. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information, including with respect to online tracking, as well as to monitor developments regarding the use of AI that could be relevant to our products and services. Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, damage our reputation and customers\u2019 trust.

Learning & Development of D&I Values. Our leaders across the organization work directly with our Head of Diversity and Inclusion to identify and provide relevant trainings for their teams. This year, the team launched a BIDS Certificate program focusing on inclusive leadership and psychological safety. The team also delivered many trainings on allyship, the value of diversity on teams, and disability etiquette.  Strategic Inclusive Development. A Global Council of employees meets every two months to review and provide feedback on BIDS developments and programs as well as sharing feedback on ongoing diversity and inclusion efforts. Further, our Employee Handbook has been updated to formalize certain inclusivity initiatives. Additionally, we have assessed the language within the source code of our products and platforms to ensure that it is inclusive and does not perpetuate racist stereotypes. Leadership Engagement. C-Suite Executives, alongside the COO and CEO, receive quarterly updates on diversity data and inclusion-building efforts. Additionally, the CEO and senior leaders across the organization have diversity and inclusion objectives embedded in their annual and quarterly goals. Each ERG/Mosaic is supported by an Executive Sponsor. Sourcing & Recruiting. We train our recruiting workforce on the value of hiring diverse teams and diversity sourcing strategies, and we partner with external organizations that develop and supply diverse talent. In addition, we are building a diversity dashboard to better understand our metrics around applicants, candidates, and the current workforce. In 2022, we launched campaigns focused on collecting internal data and gathering diverse prospective candidates. Talent Development & Retention Building and strengthening our talent pipeline is imperative to our success. Our approach to talent and performance is designed to ensure employees and managers have regular feedback conversations about performance goals and development, to enable our high-performance culture, and to create an environment where we achieve our strategy.  -20- -20- -20- Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC.
