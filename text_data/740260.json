{"cik": 740260, "item_1A": "ITEM\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business   BUSINESS  Overview  Ventas, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) operating at the intersection of healthcare and real estate.  We hold a highly diversified portfolio of senior housing communities, medical office buildings (\u201cMOBs\u201d), life science, research and innovation centers, hospitals and other healthcare facilities, which we generally refer to collectively as \u201chealthcare real estate,\u201d located throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or had investments in approximately 1,300 properties (including properties classified as held for sale). Our company was originally founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York.  We primarily invest in a diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets through wholly owned subsidiaries and other co-investment entities. We operate through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, senior housing operating portfolio, which we also refer to as \u201cSHOP\u201d and which was formerly known as senior living operations, and office operations. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes, including \u201cNote 2 \u2013 Accounting Policies\u201d and \u201cNote 18 \u2013 Segment Information,\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \u201cAnnual Report\u201d). Our senior housing communities are either subject to triple-net leases, in which case they are included in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, or operated by independent third-party managers, in which case they are included in our SHOP reportable business segment.  As of December 31, 2022, we leased a total of 326 properties (excluding properties within our office operations reportable business segment) to various healthcare operating companies under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Our three largest tenants, Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, \u201cBrookdale Senior Living\u201d), Ardent Health Partners, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, \u201cArdent\u201d) and Kindred Healthcare, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, \u201cKindred\u201d), leased from us 121 properties, 30 properties and 29 properties, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.  As of December 31, 2022, pursuant to long-term management agreements, we engaged independent operators, such as Atria Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, including Holiday Retirement (\u201cHoliday\u201d), \u201cAtria\u201d) and Sunrise Senior Living, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, \u201cSunrise\u201d), to manage 553 senior housing communities in our SHOP reportable business segment.  As of December 31, 2022, we owned a total of 376 properties in our office operations reportable business segment.  These properties generally consist of MOBs that are predominantly located on or contiguous to a health system campus and life science, research and innovation properties that are affiliated with and often located on or contiguous to a university or academic medical campus. Through our Lillibridge Healthcare Services,\u00a0Inc. (\u201cLillibridge\u201d) subsidiary and our ownership interest in PMB Real Estate Services\u00a0LLC (\u201cPMBRES\u201d), we also provide office management, leasing, marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems throughout the United States.   In addition, from time to time, we make secured and unsecured loans and other investments relating to healthcare real estate or operators.   We have a third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management (\u201cVIM\u201d), which includes our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund (the \u201cVentas Fund\u201d). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in healthcare real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner. See \u201cNote 7 \u2013 Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.   Starting in 2020, our business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken to prevent the spread of the virus and its variants, and its extended consequences. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 and \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto\u201d included in Part II, Item 8, in each case, of this Annual Report.  1 1 1   Business Strategy  We aim to enhance shareholder value by delivering consistent, superior total returns through a strategy of (1)\u00a0generating reliable and growing cash flows, (2)\u00a0maintaining a balanced, diversified portfolio of high-quality assets and (3)\u00a0preserving our financial strength, flexibility and liquidity.   Aiming to Generate Reliable and Growing Cash Flows  We aim to generate reliable and growing cash flows from our portfolio, which enables us to pay regular cash dividends to stockholders and creates opportunities to increase stockholder value through profitable investments. We believe that the combination of steady contractual growth from our long-term triple-net leases, steady, reliable cash flows from our loan investments, stable cash flows from our office buildings, and the higher growth potential inherent in our senior housing operating communities will enable us to generate sustainable, growing cash flows that are resilient to economic downturns.     Aiming to maintain a Balanced, Diversified Portfolio of High-Quality Assets  We aim to maintain a balanced portfolio of high-quality assets diversified by investment type, geographic location, asset type, tenant or operator, revenue source and operating model because we believe such approach diminishes the risk that any single factor or event could materially harm our business. Portfolio diversification also enhances the reliability of our cash flows by reducing our exposure to any particular asset class or market, or individual tenant, borrower or manager and we believe such diversification helps mitigate the impact of certain risks, including risks related to regulatory changes, climate events, rising inflation and interest rates and economic downturns or global health events.  Preserving Our Financial Strength, Flexibility and Liquidity  Our goal to maintain a strong, flexible balance sheet and substantial liquidity helps enable us to capitalize on strategic growth opportunities in the healthcare industry through acquisitions, investments and development and redevelopment projects. We aim to maintain our financial strength to pursue profitable investment opportunities by actively managing our leverage and improving our cost of capital. In addition, we seek to actively preserve our access to multiple sources of capital and liquidity, including unsecured bank debt, mortgage financings, public and private debt and equity markets, and through our third-party institutional capital management business, VIM.  2 2 2   Portfolio Summary  The following table summarizes our consolidated portfolio of properties and other investments, including construction in progress, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Real Estate InvestmentsRevenuesAsset TypeProperties (1)Units/Sq.

(2)Senior housing communities are generally measured in units; MOBs and research and innovation centers are measured by square footage; and IRFs and LTACs, health systems and SNFs are generally measured by licensed bed count. (3)As of December 31, 2022, we leased 87 of our consolidated MOBs pursuant to triple-net leases. Lillibridge or PMBRES managed 231 of our consolidated MOBs and nine of our consolidated MOBs were managed by six managers. Through Lillibridge, we also provided management and leasing services for 51 MOBs owned by third parties as of December 31, 2022.    In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we owned nine senior housing communities, 14 life science, research and innovation centers, three MOBs and five properties under development through investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, primarily through our VIM business. See \u201cNote 7 \u2013 Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Senior Housing Communities  As of December 31, 2022, we had 802 properties that are operated as senior housing communities in our triple-net lease properties reportable segment and SHOP reportable segment. Our senior housing communities include independent living communities, assisted living communities, memory care communities and continuing care retirement communities. Independent living communities are typically age-restricted multifamily rental properties with central dining facilities that provide residents with access to meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation and social and recreational activities.  Assisted living communities typically offer supportive care that is provided by trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing and medication management. Memory care communities provide care for individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia or memory loss. Continuing care retirement communities are typically age-restricted properties that offer a continuum of care, and may include a combination of independent living, assisted living, memory care or skilled nursing units. Our assisted living, memory care and continuing care retirement communities are generally subject to state licensure requirements for the delivery of some or all of their services, while our independent living communities generally are not. Charges for room, board and services at these communities are generally paid from private sources.  Medical Office Buildings  As of December 31, 2022, we had 327 properties that are operated as medical office buildings in our office operations reportable segment. Typically, our MOBs, which are predominantly located on or contiguous to a health system campus, are multi-tenant properties leased to several unrelated medical practices, although in many cases they may be associated with a large single specialty or multi-specialty group, including neighboring health systems. Tenants include physicians, dentists, psychologists, therapists and other healthcare providers, who require space devoted to patient examination and treatment,  3 3 3   diagnostic imaging, outpatient surgery and other outpatient services. MOBs are similar to commercial office buildings, but typically require enhanced plumbing, electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate the needs of healthcare providers such as sinks in every room, brighter lights and specialized medical equipment. As of December 31, 2022, we owned approximately 18.4 million square feet of MOBs.  Through our Lillibridge subsidiary, we also managed approximately 1.6\u00a0million square feet of office properties for third parties.  Life Science, Research and Innovation Centers  As of December 31, 2022, we had 32 properties that are operated as life science, research and innovation centers in our office operations reportable segment and we had investments in 14 other life science, research and innovation centers. Our life science, research and innovation centers contain laboratory and office space primarily for universities, academic medical centers, technology, biotechnology, medical device and pharmaceutical companies and other organizations involved in the life science, research and innovation industry. While these properties have characteristics similar to commercial office buildings, they generally contain more advanced electrical, mechanical, heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems. The facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators, fume hoods, lab bench tops and related amenities. In many instances, research and innovation center tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space, in addition to landlord improvements, to accommodate biology, chemistry or medical device research initiatives. Our research and innovation centers are often located on or contiguous to university and academic medical campuses. As of December 31, 2022, we own or have investments in nearly 11.3\u00a0million square feet spanning 46 operating properties and five in progress ground-up development properties.  Inpatient Rehabilitation and Long-Term Acute Care Facilities  As of December 31, 2022, we had 29 freestanding properties that are operated as long-term acute care facilities (\u201cLTACs\u201d) in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment. LTACs have a Medicare average length of stay of greater than 25\u00a0days and serve medically complex, chronically ill patients who require a high level of monitoring and specialized care, but whose conditions do not necessitate the continued services of an intensive care unit. The operators of these LTACs have the capability to treat patients who suffer from multiple systemic failures or conditions such as neurological disorders, head injuries, brain stem and spinal cord trauma, cerebral vascular accidents, chemical brain injuries, central nervous system disorders, developmental anomalies and cardiopulmonary disorders. Chronic patients often depend on technology for continued life support, such as mechanical ventilators, total parenteral nutrition, respiration or cardiac monitors and dialysis machines, and, due to their severe medical conditions, generally are not clinically appropriate for admission to a skilled nursing facility or rehabilitation hospital. We also own seven freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities (\u201cIRFs\u201d) devoted to the rehabilitation of patients with various neurological, musculoskeletal, orthopedic and other medical conditions following stabilization of their acute medical issues.  Health Systems  As of December 31, 2022, we had 13 properties that are operated as health systems in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment. Health systems provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. These health systems also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. In the United States, these health systems receive payments for patient services from the federal government primarily under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, other private insurers and directly from patients.  Skilled Nursing Facilities  As of December 31, 2022, we had 16 properties that are operated as SNFs in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment. SNFs provide rehabilitative, restorative, skilled nursing and medical treatment for patients and residents who do not require the high technology, care-intensive, high-cost setting of an acute care or rehabilitation hospital. Treatment programs include physical, occupational, speech, respiratory and other therapies, including sub-acute clinical protocols such as wound care and intravenous drug treatment. Charges for these services are generally paid from a combination of government reimbursement and private sources.  Loans and Investments  As of December 31, 2022, we held $561.4 million of loans receivable and investments, net of allowance, relating to healthcare real estate. Our loans receivable and investments generally provide us with interest income and fees, and are often  4 4 4   secured by mortgage liens or leasehold mortgages on the underlying properties and corporate or personal guarantees by affiliates of the borrowing entity. In some cases, the loans are secured by a pledge of ownership interests in the entity or entities that own the related properties or may take the form of mezzanine loans, which are subordinated to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate. See \u201cNote 6 \u2013 Loans Receivable and Investments\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report.    Development and Redevelopment Projects   We are party to certain agreements that obligate us to develop properties funded through capital that we and, in certain circumstances, our joint venture partners provide. As of December 31, 2022, we had 17 properties under development pursuant to these agreements, including five properties that are owned through unconsolidated real estate entities. In addition, from time to time, we engage in redevelopment projects with respect to our existing properties to maximize the value, increase net operating income (\u201cNOI,\u201d which is defined as total revenues, excluding interest and other income, less property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses), maintain a market-competitive position, achieve property stabilization or change the primary use of the property.  Geographic Diversification of Properties  Our portfolio of assets is broadly diversified by geographic location throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, with properties in only one state (California) accounting for more than 10% of our total continuing revenues and NOI for the year ended December 31, 2022. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), to NOI.  Segment Information  We operate through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, senior housing operating portfolio and office operations. Non-segment assets, classified as \u201cNon-segment,\u201d consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to these segments, in significant part, based on NOI and related measures. For further information regarding our business segments and a discussion of our definition of NOI, see \u201cNote 18 \u2013 Segment Information\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report and for a reconciliation of NOI to our net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d  Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (SHOP)  In our SHOP reportable business segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the United States and Canada and engage independent managers, such as Atria and Sunrise, to operate and manage those communities. The REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (\u201cRIDEA\u201d) permits us to own or partially own qualified healthcare properties in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties\u2019 operations (as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments under a triple-net lease) in compliance with REIT requirements. In a RIDEA structure, we are required to rely on a third-party manager to manage and operate the property, including procuring supplies, hiring and training all employees, entering into all third-party contracts for the benefit of the property, including resident/patient agreements, complying with laws and regulations, including but not limited to healthcare laws, and providing resident care and services, in exchange for a management fee. As a result, we must rely on our managers\u2019 personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, risk management processes, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior housing operations efficiently and effectively. We also rely on our managers to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results in a timely manner and otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations.  Office Operations  In our office operations reportable business segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage MOBs and life science, research and innovation centers throughout the United States. Our MOBs, which are predominantly located on or contiguous to a health system campus, are typically multi-tenant properties leased to several unrelated medical practices, many of which may be associated with a large single specialty or multi-specialty group. Through our Lillibridge subsidiary and  5 5 5   our ownership interest in PMBRES, we also provide MOB management, leasing, marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems throughout the United States. Our life science, research and innovation centers contain laboratory and office space primarily for universities, academic medical centers, technology, biotechnology, medical device and pharmaceutical companies and other organizations involved in the life science, research and innovation industry.  Triple-Net Leased Properties  In our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, we invest in and own senior housing and healthcare properties throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and lease those properties to healthcare operating companies under triple-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures.  Significant Tenants and Managers  The following table summarizes certain information regarding our tenant and manager concentration as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (excluding properties classified as held for sale and properties owned by investments in unconsolidated real estate entities): Number of Properties Leased or ManagedPercent of Total Real Estate Investments (1)Percent of Total RevenuesPercent of NOISHOP544\u00a053.9\u00a0%64.3\u00a0%35.1\u00a0%Brookdale Senior Living (2)121\u00a07.8\u00a03.6\u00a08.1\u00a0Ardent30\u00a05.3\u00a03.2\u00a07.1\u00a0Kindred29\u00a00.8\u00a03.2\u00a07.3\u00a0 Percent of Total Real Estate Investments (1) Brookdale Senior Living (2) ______________________________ (1)Based on gross book value. (2)Excludes nine properties managed by Brookdale Senior Living pursuant to long-term management agreements and included in the SHOP reportable business segment.  Triple-Net Leased Properties   Each of our leases with Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred is a triple-net lease that obligates the tenant to pay all property-related expenses including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures, and to comply with the terms of mortgage financing documents, if any, affecting the properties. In addition, each of our Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred leases is guaranteed by a corporate parent. The properties we lease to Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred accounted for a significant portion of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and NOI for the year ended December 31, 2022. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our Business Operations and Strategy Risks\u2014A significant portion of our revenues and operating income is dependent on a limited number of tenants and managers, including Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent, Kindred, Atria and Sunrise.\u201d included in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Annual Report.  Brookdale Senior Living Lease  As of December 31, 2022, we leased 121 properties (excluding nine properties managed by Brookdale Senior Living pursuant to long-term management agreements and included in the SHOP reportable business segment) to Brookdale Senior Living pursuant to a single, triple-net master lease agreement (together with certain other agreements related to such master lease, collectively, the \u201cBrookdale Lease\u201d). The aggregate contractual base rent due to us from Brookdale Senior Living in 2022 was approximately $105.9 million, and the current aggregate contractual base rent (computed in accordance with GAAP) is approximately $148.8\u00a0million. The difference between the aggregate contractual base rent due in 2022 and the current aggregate contractual base rent (computed in accordance with GAAP) is, in part, a result of the amortization over the remaining lease term of $235\u00a0million of up-front consideration received as part of certain amendments to the Brookdale Lease in July 2020.  Under the terms of the Brookdale Lease, base rent escalates annually at 3% per annum, which escalation commenced on January 1, 2022. The existing term of the Brookdale Lease expires December 31, 2025 and Brookdale has the option to renew such term for two, 10-year extensions at the greater of escalated rent and fair market rent. The Brookdale Lease is guaranteed by Brookdale Senior Living, Inc.  6 6 6   In addition, we hold warrants for 16.3 million shares of Brookdale Senior Living common stock, which are exercisable at any time prior to December 31, 2025 and have an exercise price of $3.00 per share. The warrants are classified within other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measured at fair value with changes in fair value being recognized within other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  Ardent Lease  As of December 31, 2022, we leased 11 properties (excluding 19 MOBs leased to Ardent under separate leases included in our office operations segment) to Ardent pursuant to a single, triple-net master lease agreement (together with certain other agreements related to such master lease, collectively, the \u201cArdent Lease\u201d). The aggregate 2022 contractual base rent due to us from Ardent was approximately $130.4\u00a0million, and the current aggregate contractual base rent (computed in accordance with GAAP) was approximately $130.5\u00a0million. Under the terms of the Ardent Lease, base rent escalates annually by the lesser of four times the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the relevant period and 2.5%. The existing term of the Ardent Lease expires August 31, 2035 and Ardent has the option to renew such term for one, 10-year extension at contractual escalated rent. The Ardent Lease is guaranteed by the Ardent parent company.  We also hold a 9.8% ownership interest in Ardent, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, as well as the right to appoint one member to the Ardent Board of Directors. We account for our investment in Ardent under the equity method of accounting. In September 2022, Ardent\u2019s majority equity owner entered into a definitive purchase agreement to sell a minority equity investment in Ardent to a third-party investor. We have the right to, and have elected to, participate in the proposed transaction by selling approximately 24% of our ownership interest to the third-party investor on the same terms. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and we cannot assure you that the transaction will close or, if it does close, when the closing will occur.  Kindred Lease  As of December 31, 2022, we leased 29 properties to Kindred pursuant to a single, triple-net master lease agreement (together with certain other agreements related to such master lease, collectively, the \u201cKindred Lease\u201d). Pursuant to the Kindred Lease, the 29 properties are divided into two groups. The first group is composed of six properties (\u201cGroup 1\u201d) and the second renewal group is composed of 23 properties (\u201cGroup 2\u201d).  The aggregate 2022 contractual base rent due to us from Kindred was approximately $132.1\u00a0million, and the current aggregate contractual base rent (computed in accordance with GAAP) was approximately $134.1\u00a0million.\u00a0Kindred is also obligated to pay additional rent in respect of the Group 1 properties equal to a percentage of aggregate patient revenues over a specified threshold. Base rent escalates annually (a) based on year-over-year changes in CPI, subject to a floor and cap, for 25 properties; and (b) 2.7% for four properties. The base rent escalator with respect to seven properties is contingent upon satisfaction of specified facility revenue parameters.  The existing term of the Kindred Lease expires on April 30, 2028 for Group 1 and April 30, 2025 for Group 2.  Kindred has the option to renew the Group 1 properties for two, 5-year extensions at the greater of escalated rent and fair market rent.  Kindred has the option to renew the Group 2 properties for one, 5-year extension at escalated rent and, following that, two additional 5-year extensions at the greater of escalated rent and fair market rent. The Kindred Lease is guaranteed by a parent company.  Senior Housing Operating Portfolio   As of December 31, 2022, Atria and Sunrise, collectively, provided comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 334 of the senior housing communities in our SHOP segment. Under these management agreements, the operators receive annual management fees which are calculated based on various performance measures, including revenue, NOI and other objective financial metrics. Collectively, management fee calculations typically result in the operators receiving annual management fees ranging from 4.5% to 7% of revenues generated by the applicable properties and, in some cases, additional management fees based on the achievement of specified performance targets.   7 7 7   Atria Senior Living Management Agreements  As of December 31, 2022, Atria managed 242 communities for Ventas pursuant to multiple management agreements (collectively, the \u201cAtria Management Agreements\u201d). Our Atria Management Agreements have initial terms expiring between 2024 and 2041. In some cases, the Atria Management Agreements include mutual renewal provisions. Ventas has the ability to terminate some or all of the Atria Management Agreements upon certain events with or without the payment of a fee. By way of example, Ventas has the right to terminate Atria\u2019s management of 91 communities that were historically managed by Holiday Senior Living upon short term notice.   We hold a 34% ownership interest in Atria, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, as well as the right to appoint two members to the Atria Board of Directors.  We account for our investment in Atria under the equity method of accounting.  Sunrise Senior Living Management Agreements  As of December 31, 2022, Sunrise managed 92 communities for Ventas pursuant to multiple management agreements (collectively, the \u201cSunrise Management Agreements\u201d). Our Sunrise Management Agreements have initial terms expiring between 2035 and 2040. Ventas has the ability to terminate some or all of the Sunrise Management Agreements upon certain circumstances with or without the payment of a fee.  Competition  We generally compete for investments in healthcare real estate with publicly traded, private and non-listed healthcare REITs, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition challenges our ability to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives, which is affected by, among other factors, the availability of suitable acquisition or investment targets, our ability to negotiate acceptable transaction terms and our access to and cost of capital. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our Business Operations and Strategy Risk\u2014Our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon identifying and consummating future investments and effectively managing our expansion opportunities.\u201d included in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Annual Report and \u201cNote 10 \u2013 Senior Notes Payable and Other Debt\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report.  Our tenants and managers also compete on a local and regional basis with other healthcare operating companies that provide comparable services. Operators of healthcare real estate compete to attract and retain residents and patients to our properties based on scope and quality of care, reputation and financial condition, price, location and physical appearance of the properties, services offered, qualified personnel, physician referrals and family preferences.  With respect to MOBs and life science, research and innovation centers, we and our third-party managers compete to attract and retain tenants based on many of the same factors, in addition to quality of the affiliated health system or university, physician preferences and proximity to hospital or university campuses or life science centers and quality of lab space. The ability of our tenants, operators and managers to compete successfully could be affected by private, federal and state reimbursement programs and other laws and regulations. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\u2014We and our tenants, borrowers and managers may be adversely affected by regulation and enforcement.\u201d included in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Annual Report.  Human Capital Management  At Ventas, our experienced team drives our success and creates value. As of December 31, 2022, we had 451 employees, none of which are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  We provide a unique environment that offers opportunities for our team to use their professional skills, develop their talents and learn from each other as they build successful careers. We are committed to upholding human dignity and equal opportunity under the principles outlined in the United Nations\u2019 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Vendor Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy embed the responsibility to respect human rights in business functions across our operations as well as our supply chain.  The Compensation Committee and Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (\u201cDE&I\u201d) efforts, goals and framework. We typically report on human capital matters at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Compensation  8 8 8   Committee, on DE&I matters at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and periodically (and at least annually) to our Board of Directors. The most significant human capital measures and objectives that we focus on include the topics described below.  Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention  We strive to foster a culture that attracts and retains individuals who share a passion for integrity, flawless execution, collaborative problem-solving and, above all, excellence. A key component of our ability to attract and retain the top talent in our industry is our investment in our people and their continuous development by providing expansive professional opportunities, best-in-class leadership development and a broad array of workshops and training. Ventas also prides itself in offering an industry-leading compensation and benefits package.    DE&I  Ventas has a long-standing commitment to DE&I. We have established a DE&I framework centered around key pillars of people, culture, investment and financial, and changing our society and investing in our communities. To develop action plans for each focus area of our DE&I framework, we have established a diverse, multi-disciplinary DE&I Committee with representation across job function, level and geography. Divided into subcommittees representing each area of the framework, team members are tasked with mobilizing a strategic and coordinated effort to create positive change across our company. Development and execution of the DE&I framework is a core component of our long-term incentive compensation program. As of December 31, 2022, our workforce is 53% male and 47% female, and our Board of Directors is 50% diverse by gender or ethnicity, with two of the three NYSE-required Board committees chaired by women.  Health & Safety  Ventas is committed to the health and safety of its employees. Helping to make our workplaces secure and hazard-free is a responsibility shared with each Ventas employee. Our commitment to health and safety is maintained by effective administration, training and education, and we expect our operating and development partners to comply with applicable company and legal requirements.  Environmental, Social, and Governance  Ventas recognizes that responsible and sustainable practices are essential to delivering superior long-term results. Our integrated approach to Environment, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) is structured around eight key topics organized into three strategic pillars: People, Performance and Planet, which are underpinned by strong governance and a focus on health and safety. This approach integrates ESG principles throughout our business, ensures focus and reporting on the most relevant issues and motivates our daily efforts. Ventas has set measurable goals related to each of our key ESG topics, including targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and waste. Progress against our goals is reported annually in our Corporate Sustainability Report.  Ventas convenes a cross-functional ESG Steering Committee, which provides oversight and monitoring of our ESG strategy and is led by our Chairman and CEO and overseen by our Vice President, Corporate ESG & Sustainability. In addition, we typically report on ESG matters at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and periodically (and at least annually) to our Board of Directors. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Insurance  We maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, managers or other counterparties maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in each industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. The insurance that we maintain or require may take the form of commercial insurance, captive insurance or self-insurance.  We maintain the property insurance for a vast majority of our properties in our office operations and SHOP reportable business segments. We also maintain liability insurance for certain office properties, as well as the general and professional liability insurance for certain senior housing communities and related operations in our SHOP reportable business segment. However, some senior housing managers maintain the general and professional liability insurance for our senior housing communities and related operations that they manage in accordance with the terms of our management agreements.  9 9 9    Through our office operations, we provide engineering, construction and architectural services in connection with new development projects, and we maintain and cause tenants, contractors, design professionals and other parties involved with such services to maintain property and liability insurance with respect to those activities.  In May 2020, the Company formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, which provides insurance coverage for losses below the deductible and within the self-insured retention of the commercial property, general and professional liability insurance that we maintain for certain of our office and senior housing locations. The Company created this captive as part of its overall risk management program and to stabilize insurance costs.  Additional Information  We maintain a website at www.ventasreit.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.  We make available, free of charge, through our website our Annual Report, Quarterly Reports on Form\u00a010-Q, Current Reports on Form\u00a08-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section\u00a013 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In addition, our Guidelines on Governance, our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (including waivers from and amendments to that document) and the charters for each of our Audit and Compliance, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees are available on our website, and we will mail copies of the foregoing documents to stockholders, free of charge, upon request to our Corporate Secretary at Ventas,\u00a0Inc., 353 North Clark Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois 60654.  GOVERNMENT REGULATION  CARES Act and Similar Governmental Funding Programs  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, Congress enacted a series of economic stimulus and relief measures through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (the \u201cPPPHCE Act\u201d) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (\u201cCAA\u201d). In total, the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act and the CAA authorized approximately $175 billion to be distributed to healthcare providers through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (\u201cProvider Relief Fund\u201d), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d). These grants are intended to reimburse eligible providers for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. Recipients are not required to repay distributions from the Provider Relief Fund, provided that they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including not using grants received from the Provider Relief Fund to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources are obligated to reimburse, reporting and record keeping requirements and cooperating with any government audits.   We applied for and received grants from the Provider Relief Fund in late 2020 through 2022 on behalf of the assisted living communities in our senior living operations segment. Many of our tenants, managers, borrowers and unconsolidated entities also received grants from the Provider Relief Fund. As a recipient of funds from the Provider Relief Fund, we are required to comply with detailed reporting requirements specified by HHS, including in some instances by providing a third-party audit of the use of the funds received in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards or in conformance with the requirements of 45 CFR \u00a775.514.  In addition, the HHS Office of Inspector General and the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee each have the right to conduct their own audits of our use of funds from the Provider Relief Fund and HHS has the right to recoup some or all of the payments if it determines those payments were not made or the funds not used in compliance with its rules, regulations and interpretive guidance.   We, and our tenants, borrowers, managers and unconsolidated entities also received grants administered by other domestic, foreign, local, regional or national governments on behalf of our senior housing communities to partially mitigate losses attributable to COVID-19.  The CARES Act and related legislation also made other forms of financial assistance available to healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which benefited our tenants and our senior living operations segment to varying degrees. This assistance included Medicare and Medicaid payment adjustments and an expansion of the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program, which made accelerated payments of Medicare funds available in 2020 in order to increase cash flow to providers. These accelerated payments are repaid by recoupment from future Medicare payments owed to providers beginning one year from the date the payment was issued.  The Cares Act and related legislation also temporarily  10 10 10   suspended Medicare sequestration payment adjustments, expanded coverage of COVID-19 testing and preventive services, addressed healthcare workforce needs and eased other legal and regulatory burdens on healthcare providers.   There remains a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the implementation, interpretation and application of the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act and the CAA and the rules, regulations and guidance thereunder. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014COVID-19 Risks\u2014There is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and other pandemic-related legislation and any future COVID-19 relief measures.  There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial assistance we or our tenants or borrowers will receive or retain.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.   Federal, state and local governments and agencies implemented or announced other programs to provide financial and other support to businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which benefited our tenants, borrowers, managers and our senior living operations segment, but that impose significant regulatory and compliance obligations.  Certain aspects of federal, state and local governmental programs may be contingent upon the continued effectiveness of COVID-19 federal, state or local public health emergency declarations.  On January 20, 2023, President Biden announced plans to extend the federal COVID-19 national and public health emergencies to May 11, 2023, and then end both emergencies on that date.  United States Healthcare Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement  Overview  We, along with our tenants, borrowers, and managers in the United States, are subject to or impacted by extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to quality of care, licensure and certificates of need (\u201cCON\u201d), conduct of operations, government reimbursement, such as Medicare and Medicaid, fraud and abuse, qualifications of personnel, appropriateness and classification of care, adequacy of plant and equipment and data security and privacy. Although the effects of these laws and regulations on our business are typically indirect, some of these laws and regulations apply directly to us and the senior housing communities in our senior living operations segment, where we generally hold the applicable healthcare licenses and enroll in applicable reimbursement programs. Healthcare laws and regulations are wide-ranging, and noncompliance may result in the imposition of civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including: the loss or suspension of accreditation, licenses or CONs; suspension of or non-payment for new admissions; denial of reimbursement; fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs; or facility closure. Changes in laws or regulations, reimbursement policies, enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by us or our tenants, borrowers or managers could have a significant effect on our and their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.  Licensure, Certification and CONs  Regulation of senior housing communities consists primarily of state and local laws that may require licenses, certifications and permits, and may vary greatly from one jurisdiction to another. Our senior housing communities that receive Medicaid payments are also subject to extensive federal laws and regulation. Inpatient rehabilitation and long-term acute care facilities, health systems, and skilled nursing facilities, which we do not directly operate, are typically subject to extensive federal and state regulation and must hold various licenses, certifications, and permits. Licensure and certification may be conditioned on requirements related to, among other things, the quality of medical care provided by an operator, qualifications of the operator\u2019s administrative personnel and clinical staff, adequacy of the physical plant and equipment and continuing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Federal and state government agencies issued additional requirements in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which impose COVID-19 testing, reporting and other requirements.  Sanctions for failure to comply with licensure and certification laws and regulations include loss of licensure or certification and ability to participate in or receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, suspension of or non-payment for new admissions, fines, and potential criminal penalties. Even if we are not the operator of a facility, imposition of such sanctions could adversely affect the healthcare facility operator\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations to us. Further, if we have to replace a tenant, we may experience difficulties in finding a replacement and effectively and efficiently transitioning the property to a new tenant. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our Business Operations and Strategy Risks\u2014If we need to replace any of our tenants or managers, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, if at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.  11 11 11   In addition, many of our licensed facilities and tenants are subject to state CON laws, which require governmental approval prior to the development or expansion of licensed facilities and services. The approval process in states with CON laws generally requires a facility to demonstrate the need for additional or expanded licensed facilities or services.  CONs, where applicable, are also sometimes necessary for changes in ownership or control of licensed facilities, addition of beds, investment in major capital equipment, introduction of new services or termination of services previously approved through the CON process. CON laws and regulations may restrict our or our tenants\u2019 ability to expand and grow in certain circumstances, which could have an adverse effect on our or their revenues.  Fraud and Abuse Enforcement  Participants in the U.S. healthcare industry are subject to complex federal and state civil and criminal laws and regulations governing healthcare provider referrals, relationships and arrangements. These laws include: (i) federal and state false claims acts, which generally prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs; (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or generate business involving healthcare items or services payable by Medicare or Medicaid; (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws, which generally prohibit referrals of certain services by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship; and (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws and prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services.  Violating these healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations may result in criminal and civil penalties, such as punitive sanctions, damage assessments, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local governmental agencies, and many can also be enforced by private litigants through federal and state false claims acts and other laws that allow private individuals to bring whistleblower suits known as qui tam actions.  Reimbursement  Sources of revenue for us and some of our tenants include, among others, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal Medicare programs and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental third-party payors, such as insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a medical assistance program for eligible needy persons that is funded jointly by federal and state governments and administered by the states. Medicaid eligibility requirements and benefits vary by state. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation, regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law.   As federal and state governments face significant budgetary pressures, they continue efforts to reduce Medicare and Medicaid spending through methods such as reductions in reimbursement rates and increased enrollment in managed care programs. Private payors, such as insurance companies, are typically for-profit companies and are continuously seeking opportunities to control healthcare costs. In some cases, private payors rely on government reimbursement systems to determine reimbursement rates, such that reductions in Medicare and Medicaid payment rates may negatively impact payments from private payors. These changes may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and managers.  Additionally, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that directly or indirectly affect reimbursement. Several of these laws, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), have promoted shifting from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement models to alternative payment models that tie reimbursement to quality and cost of care, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments. It is difficult to predict the nature and success of future financial or delivery system reforms, but changes to reimbursement rates and related policies could adversely impact our and our tenants\u2019 results of operations.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 7.0% of our total revenues and 15.6% of our total NOI were attributable to acute and post-acute healthcare facilities in which our third-party tenants receive reimbursement for their healthcare services under governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We are neither a participant in, nor a direct recipient of, any reimbursement under these programs with respect to those leased facilities.  12 12 12   Data Privacy and Security  Privacy and security regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), restrict the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (\u201cprotected health information\u201d or \u201cPHI\u201d), provide for individual rights and require safeguards for PHI and notification of breaches of unsecure PHI. Entities subject to HIPAA include most healthcare providers, including some of our tenants and borrowers. These covered entities are required to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is electronically maintained or transmitted.  Business associates of covered entities who create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI are also subject to certain HIPAA provisions. Violations of HIPAA may result in substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties.  There are several other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security of personal information. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. In most cases, we depend on our tenants and managers to fulfill any compliance obligations with respect to HIPAA and other privacy and security laws and regulations.  International Healthcare Regulation  We own senior housing communities in Canada and the United Kingdom. Senior living residences in Canada are provincially regulated. Within each province, there are different categories for senior living residences that are generally based on the level of care sought or required by a resident (e.g., assisted or retirement living, senior living residences, residential care, long-term care). In some of these categories and depending on the province, residences may be government funded, or the individual residents may be eligible for a government subsidy, while other residences are exclusively private-pay. The governing legislation and regulations vary by province, but generally impose licensing requirements and requirements related to quality control, public health, infection control and other care-related operating standards.  These laws empower regulators in each province to take a variety of steps to ensure compliance, conduct inspections, issue reports and generally regulate the industry.  Our communities in Canada are also subject to privacy legislation, including, in certain provinces, privacy laws specifically related to personal health information. Although the obligations of senior living residences in the various provinces differ, they all include the obligation to protect personal information. The powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts. Our senior living residences in Canada are also subject to a variety of other laws and regulations, including minimum wage standards and other employment laws.    In the United Kingdom, our senior housing communities are principally regulated as \u201ccare home services\u201d under the Health and Social Care Act 2008. This legislation subjects service providers to standards of care and requires, among other things, that all persons carrying out such activities, and the managers of such persons, be registered. Providers of care home services are also subject (as data controllers) to laws and regulations governing their use of personal data (including in relation to their employees, clients and recipients of their services). These laws take the form of the U.K.\u2019s Data Protection Act 2018.  The Data Protection Act imposes a significant number of obligations on controllers with the potential for fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater. Our business operations in the United Kingdom are also subject to a range of other regulations, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010.   The United Kingdom exited from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (\u201cBrexit\u201d). The impact of Brexit on the healthcare industry will depend on a variety of factors, including the evolution of healthcare regulatory and immigration policy and the broader economic outlook in the United Kingdom.  Regulation Impacting Life Science, Research and Innovation Centers  We lease a number of our assets to tenants in the life science, research and innovation sector, which includes university-affiliated organizations and private sector companies. These tenants may be dependent on private investors, the federal government or other sources of funding to support their activities. Creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital, in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry; it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance. Therefore, our tenants in the life science, research and innovation industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Environmental, Economic and Market Risks\u2014Our life science, research and innovation tenants face unique levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.  Our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and government reimbursement policies, including changes under the current presidential administration or by private healthcare payors. 13 13 13    Tax Regulation  We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999. Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the \u201cdouble taxation\u201d that ordinarily results from investment in a C corporation. We will, however, be required to pay U.S. federal income tax in certain circumstances.    The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association:   (1)   that is managed by one or more trustees or directors;   (2)   that issues transferable shares or transferable certificates to evidence its beneficial ownership;   (3)   that would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code;  (4)   that is not a financial institution or an insurance company within the meaning of certain provisions of the Code;  (5)   that is beneficially owned by 100 or more persons;   (6)   not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals, including certain specified entities, during the last half of each taxable year; and  (7)   that meets other tests, regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions.   We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us, and will continue to allow us, to satisfy conditions (1) through (7) inclusive, during the relevant time periods, and we intend to continue to be organized and operate in this manner. However, qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, including through actual operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be organized or will be able to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.    If we lose our status as a REIT (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because:  \u2022We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax;  \u2022We could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and  \u2022Unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.  In addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain REIT status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our REIT Status Risks\u201d.  Environmental Regulation  A wide variety of federal, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect our assets. However, these complex federal, state and foreign statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which impose strict liability on offenders. Some of these federal, state and foreign laws and regulations may directly impact us. Under various federal, local and foreign environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property).  14 14 14   With respect to our properties that are operated or managed by third parties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and cleanup of any property from which there is or has been an actual or threatened release of a regulated material and any other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. Such costs typically are not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property\u2019s value. In addition, we may be liable for certain other costs, such as governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources, as a result of any such actual or threatened release. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Our Business Operations and Strategy Risks\u2014Our operating assets may expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.  Under the terms of our leases and loans, we generally have a right to indemnification by the tenants of our properties or borrowers for any contamination caused by them.  In some instances, we have also agreed to indemnify our tenants and managers against any environmental claims (including penalties and cleanup costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or relating to, the leased properties at any time before the applicable lease commencement date. With respect to our senior living operating portfolio, we have agreed to indemnify our managers against any environmental claims (including penalties and cleanup costs) resulting from any condition on those properties.
