Competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia due to comparatively low electric rates. Additionally, our gas distribution operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. Revenues from gas distribution operations are more significant during the heating season, which is primarily from November through March. Please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Gas Distribution Operations,\" for additional information. Electric Operations We generate, transmit and distribute electricity through our subsidiary NIPSCO to approximately 486,000 customers in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana and also engage in wholesale electric and transmission transactions. We own and operate sources of generation as well as source power through PPAs. We continue to transition our generation portfolio to primarily renewable sources. During 2021, we operated Rosewater for the full year, Indiana Crossroads Wind went into service during December 2021, and in December of 2022 we closed on the Indiana Crossroads Solar project, which is expected to go into service in 2023. In October 2021, NIPSCO completed the retirement of two coal-burning units with installed capacity of approximately 903 MW at Schahfer Generating Station, located in Wheatfield, IN. We also purchased energy generated from renewable sources through PPAs in 2022. As of December\u00a031, 2022 we have multiple PPAs that provide 500 MW of capacity, with contracts expiring between 2024 and 2040.

Refer to Note 4, \"Variable Interest Entities,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  In November 2021, NIPSCO submitted its 2021 Integrated Resource Plan (\"2021 Plan\") with the IURC. The 2021 plan builds upon the 2018 Integrated Resource Plan which outlined NIPSCO\u2019s plan to retire its coal generating assets by 2028. The 2021 plan affirmed the 2018 retirement decisions and calls for the replacement of the retiring units with a diverse portfolio of resources including demand side management resources, modest amounts of incremental solar, stand-alone energy storage, new gas peaking resources and upgrades to existing facilities at the Sugar Creek Generating Station, among other steps. Refer to Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for further discussion of these plans. NIPSCO\u2019s transmission system, with voltages from 69,000 to 765,000 volts, consists of 3,016 circuit miles. NIPSCO is interconnected with eight neighboring electric utilities. NIPSCO participates in the MISO transmission service and wholesale energy market. MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Additionally, MISO is responsible for managing energy markets, transmission constraints and the day-ahead, real-time, Financial Transmission Rights and ancillary markets. NIPSCO has transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO, and transmission service for NIPSCO occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff. NIPSCO generating units are dispatched by MISO which takes into account economics, reliability of the MISO system and unit availability. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, NIPSCO generating units were dispatched to meet 41.65% of its load requirements, and NIPSCO purchased 58.35% from the MISO market. 7 7 7 Table of ContentsITEM\u00a01. BUSINESSNISOURCE INC. Table of Contents  ITEM\u00a01. BUSINESS NISOURCE INC. Competition. Our electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under Indiana regulations, and retail electric customers in Indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier. NIPSCO faces non-utility competition from other energy sources, such as self-generation by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources. Our electric operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. Revenues from electric operations are more significant during the cooling season, which is primarily from June through September. Please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Electric Operations,\" for additional information. Political Action The NiSource Political Action Committee (\"NiPAC\") provides our employees a voice in the political process. NiPAC is a voluntary, employee and director driven and funded political action committee, and NiPAC makes bipartisan political contributions to local, state and federal candidates, where permitted and in accordance with established guidelines. Consistent with our commitments and our approach to engagement, the NiPAC leadership committee members evaluate candidates for support on issues important to our business.  Regulatory The regulatory landscape applicable to our operations, including environmental regulations, at both the state and federal levels, continue to evolve. These changes have had and will continue to have an impact on our operations, structure and profitability. Management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment, while keeping service and affordability for customers at the forefront. We believe we are, in all material respects, in compliance with such laws and regulations and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations, and the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty. Rate Case Actions.

BUSINESS NISOURCE INC. FERC. NiSource\u2019s service companies and operating companies are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FERC. NiSource Corporate Services files a FERC Form 60 annual report with its financial information as a FERC jurisdictional centralized service company. NiSource also files an annual FERC Form 61 which contains a narrative description of the service company's functions during the prior calendar year.  As natural gas LDCs, Columbia of Maryland and Columbia of Ohio have limited jurisdictional certificates to transport gas in the respective service territories into interstate commerce. NIPSCO and Columbia of Pennsylvania currently have applications pending at FERC for limited jurisdictional certificates. As an electric company, NIPSCO has Market Based Rate authority and is a Transmission Owner subject to FERC jurisdiction. NIPSCO files the following reports annually: FERC Form 1, which is a comprehensive financial and operating report, FERC Form 566, which is a list of its 20 largest purchases of electricity over the past three years; FERC Form 715, which is its Annual Transmission Planning and Evaluation Report and the base case power flow data from the Eastern Interconnection Reliability Assessment Group Multiregional Modeling Working Group, which was used by NIPSCO for transmission planning; and FERC Form 730, which is NIPSCO\u2019s Report of Transmission Investment Activity. As a Transmission Owner subject to the MISO Transmission Owners Agreement and Tariff, NIPSCO has various FERC jurisdictional obligations such as maintaining its Attachment O formula rates and corresponding protocols. NIPSCO also has FERC approvals to make affiliate transactions between itself and various JVs. NIPSCO\u2019s officers, on the electric side, are also subject to FERC\u2019s interlocking directorate rules and reporting requirements. Regulatory Framework. The Gas Distribution Operations utilities have pursued non-traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include (i) the sale of products and services in the companies\u2019 service territories, and (ii) gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The on-system services are offered by us to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations utility's system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations utilities an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers.  We recognize that energy efficiency reduces emissions, conserves natural resources and saves our customers money. Our gas distribution companies offer programs such as energy efficiency upgrades, home checkups and weatherization services. The increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards contributes to a long-term trend of declining average use per customer. While we are looking to expand offerings so the energy efficiency programs can benefit as many customers as possible, our Gas Distribution Operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred. Columbia of Ohio has adopted a straight fixed variable rate design that closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. Columbia of Maryland and Columbia of Virginia have regulatory approval for weather and revenue normalization adjustments for certain customer classes, which adjust monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels. Columbia of Pennsylvania continues to operate its pilot residential weather normalization adjustment and also has a fixed customer charge. This weather normalization adjustment only adjusts revenues when actual weather compared to normal varies by more than 3%. Columbia of Kentucky incorporates a weather normalization adjustment for certain customer classes and also has a fixed customer charge. In a prior gas base rate proceeding, NIPSCO implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward recovering more of its fixed costs through a fixed recovery charge, but has no weather or usage protection mechanism. While increased efficiency of electric appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has similarly impacted the average use per electric customer in recent years, NIPSCO expects future growth in per customer usage as a result of increasing electric applications. Further growth is anticipated as electric vehicles become more prevalent. These ongoing changes in use of electricity will likely lead to development of innovative rate designs, and NIPSCO will continue efforts to design rates that increase the certainty of recovery of fixed costs. Cost Recovery and Trackers. Comparability of our line item operating results is impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as those described below. Increases in the expenses that are subject to approved regulatory tracker mechanisms generally lead to increased regulatory assets, which ultimately result in a corresponding increase in operating revenues and, therefore, have essentially no impact on total operating income results. Certain approved regulatory tracker mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the operating companies to quickly implement revised rates and recover associated costs. A portion of the Gas Distribution Operations revenue is related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs through standard regulatory proceedings. All states in our operating area require periodic review of actual gas  9 9 9 Table of ContentsITEM\u00a01. BUSINESSNISOURCE INC. Table of Contents  ITEM\u00a01. BUSINESS NISOURCE INC. procurement activity to determine prudence and confirm the recovery of prudently incurred energy commodity costs supplied to customers. A portion of the Electric Operations revenue is related to the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These costs are recovered through a FAC, which is updated quarterly to reflect actual costs incurred to supply electricity to customers.  Environmental and Safety Matters PHMSA Regulations On December 27, 2020, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2020 was signed into law, reauthorizing funding for federal pipeline safety programs through September 30, 2023. Among other things, the PIPES Act requires that PHMSA revise the pipeline safety regulations to require operators to update, as needed, their existing distribution integrity management plans, emergency response plans, and operation and maintenance plans. The PIPES Act also requires PHMSA to adopt new requirements for managing records and updating, as necessary, existing district regulator stations to eliminate common modes of failure that can lead to overpressurization. PHMSA must also require that operators implement and utilize advanced leak detection and repair technologies that enable the location and categorization of all leaks that are hazardous, or potentially hazardous, to human safety or the environment. Natural gas companies, including NiSource and our subsidiaries, may see increased costs depending on how PHMSA implements the new mandates resulting from the PIPES Act. Climate Change Issues Physical Climate Risks. Increased frequency of severe and extreme weather events associated with climate change could materially impact our facilities, energy sales, and results of operations. We are unable to predict these events. However, we perform ongoing assessments of physical risk, including physical climate risk, to our business. More extreme and volatile temperatures, increased storm intensity and flooding, and more volatile precipitation leading to changes in lake and river levels are among the weather events that are most likely to impact our business. Efforts to mitigate these physical risks continue to be implemented on an ongoing basis. Transition Climate Risks. Future legislative and regulatory programs, at both the federal and state levels, could significantly limit allowed GHG emissions or impose a cost or tax on GHG emissions. Revised or additional future GHG legislation and/or regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction, production, distribution, transmission, storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply, financial position, financial results and cash flows. Regarding federal policies, we continue to monitor the implementation of any final and proposed climate change-related legislation and regulations, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law in November 2021; the development of the Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures, proposed by the SEC in March 2022; the IRA, signed into law in August 2022; and the EPA's proposed methane regulations for the oil and natural gas industry, but we cannot predict their impact on our business at this time. We have identified potential opportunities associated with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the IRA and are evaluating how they may align with our strategy going forward. The energy-related provisions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act include new federal funding for power grid infrastructure and resiliency investments, new and existing energy efficiency and weatherization programs, electric vehicle infrastructure for public chargers and additional LIHEAP funding over the next five years. The IRA contains climate and energy provisions, including funding to decarbonize the electric sector. In February 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement, an international treaty through which parties set nationally determined contributions to reduce GHG emissions, build resilience, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Subsequently, the Biden Administration released a target for the United States to achieve a 50%-52% GHG reduction from 2005 levels by 2030, which supports the President's goals to create a carbon-free power sector by 2035 and net zero emissions economy no later than 2050. There are many pathways to reach these goals. On June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled for the petitioners in West Virginia v. EPA, which examined the authority of the EPA to regulate GHG emissions from the power sector. We will continue to evaluate this matter, but we remain committed to our previously stated carbon reduction goals. 10 10 10 Table of ContentsITEM\u00a01. BUSINESSNISOURCE INC. Table of Contents  ITEM\u00a01. BUSINESS NISOURCE INC. We also continue to monitor the implementation of any final and proposed state policy. The Virginia Clean Economy Act was signed into law in 2020. While the Act does not establish any new mandates on Columbia of Virginia, certain natural gas customers may, over the long-term, reduce their use of natural gas to meet the 100% renewable electricity requirement. Columbia of Virginia will continue to monitor this matter, but we cannot predict its final impact on our business at this time. Separately, the Virginia Energy Innovation Act, enacted into law in April 2022, and effective July 1, 2022, allows natural gas utilities to supply alternative forms of gas that meet certain standards and reduce emissions intensity. The Act also provides that the costs of enhanced leak detection and repair may be added to a utility\u2019s plan to identify proposed eligible infrastructure replacement projects and related cost recovery mechanisms, known as the SAVE Plan. Furthermore, under the Act, utilities can recover eligible biogas supply infrastructure costs on an ongoing basis. The provisions of these laws may provide opportunities for Columbia of Virginia as it participates in the transition to a lower carbon future. The Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 requires Maryland to reduce GHG emissions by 60% by 2031 (from 2006 levels), and it requires the state to reach net zero emissions by 2045. The Maryland Department of the Environment is required to adopt a plan to achieve the 2031 goal by December 2023, and it is required to adopt a plan for the net zero goal by 2030. The Act also enacts a state policy to move to broader electrification of both existing buildings and new construction, and requires the Public Service Commission to complete a study assessing the capacity of gas and electric distribution systems to successfully serve customers under a transition to a highly electrified building sector. Columbia of Maryland will continue to monitor this matter, but we cannot predict its final impact on our business at this time. NIPSCO, Columbia of Maryland, Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia of Virginia and Columbia of Kentucky each filed petitions to implement the Green Path Rider, which will be a voluntary rider that allows customers to opt in and offset either 50% or 100% of their natural gas related emissions. To reduce the emissions, the utilities will purchase RNG attributes and carbon offsets to match the usage for customers opting into the program. The program was approved by the IURC at NIPSCO in November 2022 with a January 2023 start date. After reaching settlement with other parties in September 2022, NIPSCO agreed to add a third tier to offset 25% of customer usage. Columbia of Maryland\u2019s filing was denied by the PUC in January 2023. The filings for Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia of Virginia and Columbia of Kentucky are still being evaluated. Additionally, NIPSCO has a voluntary Green Power Rider program in place that allows customers to designate a portion or all their monthly electric usage to come from power generated by renewable energy sources. Net Zero Goal. In response to these transition risks and opportunities, on November 7, 2022, we announced a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 covering both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (\"Net Zero Goal\"). Our Net Zero Goal builds on greenhouse gas emission reductions achieved to-date and demonstrates that continued execution of our long-term business plan will drive further greenhouse gas emission reductions. We remain on track to achieve previously announced interim greenhouse gas emission reduction targets by reducing fugitive methane emissions from main and service lines by 50 percent from 2005 levels by 2025 and reducing Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions from company-wide operations by 90 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. We plan to achieve our Net Zero Goal primarily through continuation and enhancement of existing programs, such as retiring and replacing coal-fired electric generation with low- or zero-emission electric generation, ongoing pipe replacement and modernization programs, and deployment of advanced leak-detection technologies. In addition, we plan to advance other low- or zero-emission energy resources and technologies, such as hydrogen, renewable natural gas, and/or deployment of carbon capture and utilization technologies, if and when these become technologically and economically feasible. Carbon offsets and renewable energy credits may also be used to support achievement of our Net Zero Goal. As of the end of 2021, we had reduced Scope 1 GHG emissions by approximately 58% from 2005 levels. Our greenhouse gas emissions projections, including achieving a Net Zero Goal, are subject to various assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties. Achievement of our Net Zero Goal by 2040 will require supportive regulatory and legislative policies, favorable stakeholder environments and advancement of technologies that are not currently economical to deploy. Should such regulatory and legislative policies, stakeholder environments or technologies fail to materialize, our actual results or ability to achieve our Net Zero Goal, including by 2040, may differ materially. As discussed in Management's Discussion within \"Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Electric Operations,\" NIPSCO continues to execute on an electric generation transition consistent with the preferred pathways identified in its 2018 and 2021 Integrated Resource Plans. Additionally, as discussed in Management's Discussion within \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Regulatory Capital Programs,\" our natural gas distribution companies are lowering methane emissions by replacing aging infrastructure, which also increases safety and reliability for customers and communities.  Human Capital Human Capital Management Governance and Organizational Practices. The Compensation and Human Capital Committee of our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") is primarily responsible for assisting the Board in overseeing our human capital  11 11 11 Table of ContentsITEM\u00a01. BUSINESSNISOURCE INC. Table of Contents  ITEM\u00a01. BUSINESS NISOURCE INC. management practices. The Compensation and Human Capital Committee charter includes reviewing our human capital management function and programs, including related procedures, programs, policies and practices, and making recommendations to management with respect to equal employment opportunity and DE&I initiatives, employee engagement and corporate culture, and talent management. In addition to overseeing our human capital management practices, in 2022 our Board was refreshed and is committed to ensuring that the Board is comprised of directors with diverse skills, expertise, experience and demographics, including racial and gender diversity. Women and people of color (\"POC\") each comprise 33% of our Board. Human Capital Goals and Objectives. We have aligned our human capital goals to achieve overall company strategic and operational objectives by driving an enhanced talent strategy, elevating support for front-line leaders, fostering a culture of rigor and accountability and strengthening our human resources function. We aspire to be an employer of choice in the utility industry through accelerating and embedding DE&I throughout the enterprise and creating an enviable employee experience.  Workforce Composition. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had 7,117 full-time and 45 part-time active employees. Thirty-five percent of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions which expire between 2026 and 2027. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We are committed to accelerating and embedding DE&I throughout the enterprise to reflect the communities and customers we serve. We have worked to develop diverse sourcing strategies to attract and increase our diverse representation. Our talent acquisition team hired 523 external candidates in 2022 across all business segments. Twenty-eight percent of external hires in 2022 were racially or ethnically diverse and 44% were female. In addition, we have focused on our implementation and development of programs to drive higher retention and engagement of our employees. Through our efforts, we have been able to increase participation in our Targeted Development for Diverse Talent program in 2022. Participants in this program are either female or POC. POC make up 49% of the participant population for 2022. In addition, we have implemented over 50 DE&I programs with a strong emphasis on professional development and retention efforts within our seven Employee Resource Groups. We plan to post our 2022 consolidated EEO-1 report data on our website by the end of the first quarter of 2023. The following graph shows the percentage of total employees represented by gender overall and for our officers as of December\u00a031, 2022:  12 12 12 Table of ContentsITEM\u00a01. BUSINESSNISOURCE INC. Table of Contents  ITEM\u00a01. BUSINESS NISOURCE INC. The following graph shows the percentage of total employees and officers represented by race/ethnicity as of December\u00a031, 2022:  Talent Attraction. To recruit and hire individuals with a variety of skills, talents, backgrounds and experiences, we value and cultivate relationships with the community and diverse outreach partners. We also target job fairs, including those focused on people of color, veterans and women candidates, and partner with local colleges and universities to identify and recruit qualified applicants in the communities we serve. We are focused on our future of work and creating a more flexible, agile model for roles that can be performed in a more remote setting to attract talent across our footprint. In 2022, we introduced a hybrid-working model, which recognizes differing ways of working: onsite, hybrid and remote. As of December 31, 2022, 58% of our workforce is onsite, 35% are hybrid and 7% are remote. This new working model supports colleague connection, development and mentoring as well as broader team building. Talent Development and Retention. We offer leadership development programs to enhance the behaviors and skills of our existing and future leaders. In 2022, we had participation from employees at all levels in our extensive technical and non-technical employee leadership development training programs. We strive to provide promotion and advancement opportunities for employees. In 2022, for all leadership positions at the supervisor and above level posted externally, we filled 69% with internal employees. We develop and implement targeted development action plans to increase succession candidate readiness for leadership roles. Additionally, we monitor the risk and potential impact of talent loss and take action to increase retention of top talent. Retention in 2022 was over 91%. We calculate retention as the total number of separations divided by the average headcount for the annual period. These separations include involuntary separation (2%), resignation (5%), and retirement (2%). Executive Succession Planning. We perform succession planning quarterly for officer level positions to ensure that we develop and sustain a strong bench of talent capable of performing at the highest levels. Talent is identified, and potential paths of development are discussed to ensure that employees have an opportunity to build their skills and are well-prepared for future roles. We maintain formal succession plans for our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and key executive officers. The succession plan for our CEO is reviewed by the Environmental, Social, Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board and the succession plans for executive officers (other than the CEO) and other critical roles are reviewed by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee annually or more frequently as needed. 13 13 13 Table of ContentsITEM\u00a01. BUSINESSNISOURCE INC. Table of Contents  ITEM\u00a01. BUSINESS NISOURCE INC. Employee and Workplace Health and Safety. We have several programs to support employees, and their families\u2019 physical, mental, and financial well-being. These programs include a paid wellness day, telemedicine services, an Employee Assistance Program, Integrated Health Management navigation services, employee paid sick/disability leave, parental leave, and paid illness in family days. We also offer competitive medical, dental, vision, life and long-term disability programs, including employee health savings account company contributions. We have a robust program to support employee, contractor and public safety, which is led by our Chief Safety Officer and is overseen by the Safety, Operations, Regulatory and Policy Committee of our Board. As we will outline in our annual safety report on our corporate website, we continue to invest in risk reduction activities and assets. Culture and Engagement. Our culture is another important aspect of our ability to advance our strategic and operational objectives. In addition to our DE&I, recruiting, development and retention programs described above, we also invest in internal communications programs, including in-person and virtual learning and networking opportunities, as well as regular town hall communications with employees. We measure and monitor culture and employee engagement through a variety of channels including employee lifecycle, pulse, and census surveys. To instill and reinforce our values and culture, we require our employees to participate in regular trainings on ethics and compliance topics each year, including raising concerns, treating others with respect, preventing discrimination in the workplace, anti-bribery and corruption, data protection, unconscious biases, harassment, conflicts of interest, and how to use the anonymous ethics and compliance hotline. All employees receive training on our Code of Business Conduct biannually or more frequently if there is a material change in content. Our business ethics program, including the employee training program, is reviewed annually by our executive leadership team and the Audit Committee of our Board. Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee reviews reports from our Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer on employee engagement and corporate culture. Our Board reviews results and action plans related to our enterprise-wide comprehensive employee engagement survey. Our executive leadership team, including our Chief Executive Officer, communicates directly and regularly with all employees on timely ethics topics through electronic messages, coffee chats, and all-employee town hall meetings. These communications emphasize the importance of our values and culture in the workplace.
