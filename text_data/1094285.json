No commercial customer in 2022 or 2021 accounted for more than 10% of net sales for any of our segments or for the total Company. Total sales to international customers were $2,586.0 million in 2022 and $2,147.9 million in 2021.  Of these sales to international customers, our businesses in the United States accounted for $837.9 million in 2022 and $723.9 million in 2021.  There were no sales to individual countries outside of the United States in excess of 10% of the Company\u2019s sales. In both 2022 and 2021, we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries.  Approximately 90% of our net sales to international customers during 2022 were made to customers in 30 foreign countries.  In 2022, the top five countries for sales to international customers, ranked by net sales, were China, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and France and represented approximately 20% of our total net sales. Approximately 25% and 26% of our total net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively, were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S.\u00a0Government.  Information on our sales to the U.S.\u00a0Government, including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor, is as follows (in millions):U.S. Government sales by segment:202220212020Digital Imaging$619.1\u00a0$515.9\u00a0$120.9\u00a0Instrumentation108.1\u00a091.6\u00a080.6\u00a0Aerospace and Defense Electronics266.3\u00a0227.2\u00a0229.9\u00a0Engineered Systems366.4\u00a0358.4\u00a0386.8\u00a0Total U.S. Government sales$1,359.9\u00a0$1,193.1\u00a0$818.2\u00a0 Our principal U.S.\u00a0Government customer is the U.S.\u00a0Department of Defense, which totaled $1,065.1 million and $876.6 million of our total net sales for 2022 and 2021, respectively.  With the exception of the Engineered Systems segment, no U.S Government program in 2022 or 2021 accounted for more than 10% of net sales for any of our segments or for the total Company. In 2022 and 2021, the largest program with the U.S. Government within the Engineered Systems segment was the Mission Operations and Integration (\u201cMO&I\u201d) contract with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, which represented approximately 11% of Engineered Systems net sales in both 2022 and 2021. As described in greater detail under Item 1A. Risk Factors, there are risks associated with doing business with the U.S.\u00a0Government.  In 2022, approximately 80% of our U.S.\u00a0Government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixed-price type contracts, compared to 76% in 2021, with the remaining U.S. Government contracts related to cost-reimbursable contracts (\"cost-type\").  Under fixed-price type contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price.  Such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance.  Additionally, U.S.\u00a0Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S.\u00a0Government at its convenience, without identification of any default.  When contracts are terminated for convenience, we can recover costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination.  During 2022 and 2021, contracts terminated by the U.S. Government have not materially impacted our results of operations. 3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents  Many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions. Raw Materials and Suppliers Most raw materials used in our operations are readily available; however, during 2022, we experienced supply chain challenges, including increased lead times, as well as cost inflation for parts and components, logistics and labor due to availability constraints and high demand.  While the current supply chain constraints have not materially affected our business, we have implemented short-term and long-term supplier actions to reduce disruptions and prioritize mitigation.  Some raw materials are purchased from a limited set of suppliers, including international sources, due to technical capability, price, and other factors.  We leverage our existing supplier relationships and are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our purchases.  Prices of certain key raw materials and electronic components have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future. We mitigate raw material cost increases primarily with long-term supply agreements and customer price increases.  We expect inflationary and supply chain constraint trends to continue in 2023.  However, we believe our short-term and long-term supplier actions position us well to mitigate and reduce the impact these factors may have on our businesses.   Marketing Our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments.  A shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs, with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longer-term relationships.  Given the technical nature of our products, we conduct our marketing activities through a direct internal sales force as well as third-party sales representatives.  Several Teledyne businesses, including across our segments, have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers. Competition Because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, none of which we believe offer the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do.  Although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets, each of our markets is highly competitive.  Our businesses vigorously compete on quality, product performance and reliability, technical expertise, price and service.  Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do. Intellectual Property We own and control various intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, and copyrights.  We are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others.  Similarly, other companies are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.  We do not consider any single patent or trademark, or any group of them, essential either to Teledyne\u2019s business as a whole or to any one of our reportable segments.  The annual royalties received or paid under license agreements are not significant to any of our reportable segments or to Teledyne\u2019s overall operations. Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise.  We do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents, patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Environment and Other Government Regulations Information with respect to environmental matters is set forth under \u201cOther Matters \u2013 Environmental\u201d of \u201cItem 7.  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation and Financial Condition\u201d and Note 17.  No material capital expenditures relating to environmental or other government regulatory compliance are presently anticipated. Sustainability Teledyne continues to focus on developing solutions to address sustainability and climate challenges facing humanity today.  Many of our products directly support sustainability and climate challenges.  We provide a broad range of precision measurement technologies for environmental monitoring and climate research.  Our sensors and instruments are deployed everywhere: in space, on aircraft and drones, on land, on the sea surface, in the water column, and on the seafloor.  They operate around the clock, measuring greenhouse gases from space, precisely monitoring air and water quality throughout the world, and continuously profiling the Earth\u2019s oceans.  Applications of our instruments provide scientists information that spans time from the origin of the universe to providing real-time data regarding air pollution and dangerous storms, such as time-critical warning of hurricanes and tsunamis. Recently, the prominence and importance of sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) initiatives have dramatically increased.  In November 2022, we published our second Corporate Social Responsibility (\u201cCSR\u201d) report, in which we disclose and highlight some of Teledyne\u2019s most recent efforts focused on sustainability and ESG.  The CSR report,  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents  which is not incorporated by reference in this document, is available at the Corporate Social Responsibility link on our website at www.teledyne.com under the tab \u201cWho We Are\u201d. The CSR Report includes data on Teledyne\u2019s combined direct emissions (\u201cScope 1\u201d) and indirect emissions from purchased energy (\u201cScope 2\u201d), workplace safety, water usage, waste generation and recycling and workplace demographics. In 2021, we compiled the first global inventory of our greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions (starting with fiscal year 2020) and have developed a GHG monitoring and management plan.  We have set a goal to reduce our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 in company operations, normalized for revenue, by 40% from 2020 levels by the end of 2040.  Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our emission reduction goals, while at the same time providing the tools and technologies enabling environmental science and climatology across the globe.  More information about our carbon footprint and GHG emission reduction efforts and goals, and the contributions that Teledyne products make to carbon monitoring and environmental and climate science, can be found in our CSR report. Board Oversight Pursuant to the mandate in their respective charters, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) regularly reviews matters related to compliance with environmental laws and the health and safety of employees, and the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board reviews and evaluates our policies and practices and monitors our efforts in areas of legal and social responsibility, diversity and sustainability, and other ESG matters.  The Audit Committee also oversees risk management, including the impact of climate change-related risks. Human Capital We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
