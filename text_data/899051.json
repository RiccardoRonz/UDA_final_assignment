The pricing strategy involves local marketplace pricing and underwriting decisions based on risk evaluation factors to the extent permissible by applicable law and an evaluation of competitors.Pricing of property products is intended to generate risk-adjusted returns that are acceptable over a long-term period. Rate increases are pursued to keep pace with loss trends, including losses from catastrophic events and those that are weather-related (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe). We also take into consideration potential customer disruption, the impact on our ability to market our products, regulatory limitations, our competitive position and profitability. In any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather-related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations incorporated into product pricing.Property catastrophe exposure is managed with the goal of providing shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in the property business. Catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes and fires following earthquakes, wildfires and other catastrophes. Our current catastrophe reinsurance program supports our risk tolerance framework which utilizes a modeled 1-in-100 annual aggregate limit for catastrophe losses from hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires of $2.5 billion, net of reinsurance.The use of different assumptions and updates to industry models and to our risk transfer program could materially change the projected loss. Growth strategies include areas where we believe diversification can be enhanced and an appropriate return can be earned for the risk. As a result, our modeled exposure may increase. In addition, we have exposure to other severe weather events, which impact catastrophe losses.We are promoting measures to prevent and mitigate losses that are increasing due to climate change and increased severe weather including making homes and communities more resilient, enforcement of stronger building codes, adoption of sensible land use policies and expanded disaster response capabilities.Independent agent strategy  The acquisition of National General significantly enhanced our strategic position in the independent agency channel.

Business 2022 Form 10-K  Item 1. Business 2022 Form 10-K         Other Business Segments Run-off Property-Liability Segment The Run-off Property-Liability segment includes results from property and casualty insurance coverage that primarily relates to policies written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s.  Strategy  Management of this segment has been assigned to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation, exposure identification, litigation and reinsurance collection. As part of its responsibilities, this group may pursue settlement agreements including policy buybacks on direct excess commercial business when appropriate to improve the certainty of the liabilities.\u00a0At the end of 2022, 64% of the direct excess gross case reserves were attributable to settlement agreements. This group also manages other direct commercial and assumed reinsurance business in runoff and engages in reinsurance ceded and assumed commutations as required or when considered economically advantageous. Changes in the reserves established for asbestos, environmental and other run-off lines losses have occurred and may continue. Reserve changes can be caused by new information relating to new and additional claims, new exposures or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as arbitrations, litigation, legislative, judicial or regulatory actions. Environmental losses may also increase as the result of additional funding for environmental site clean-up. Challenges related to the concentration of insurance and reinsurance claims from companies who specialize in this business continue to be addressed.  Corporate and Other Segment Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations, including expenses associated with strategic initiatives.

Business Regulation Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent and substance of such regulation vary by state but generally have their source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that also delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters, including insurer solvency and statutory surplus sufficiency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, agent and broker compensation, policy forms, rate setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, privacy regulation and data security, corporate governance and risk management. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note\u00a017 of the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note\u00a015 of the consolidated financial statements. Note\u00a015 and Note\u00a017 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank\u201d) created the Federal Insurance Office (\u201cFIO\u201d) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\u201cTreasury\u201d). The FIO monitors the insurance industry, provides advice to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d), represents the U.S. on international insurance matters, and studies the current regulatory system.Additional regulations or new requirements may emerge from the activities of various regulatory entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, FIO, FSOC, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, that are evaluating solvency and capital standards for insurance company groups. In addition, the NAIC has adopted amendments to its model holding company law that have been adopted by some jurisdictions. The outcome of these actions is uncertain; however, these actions may result in an increase in the level of capital and liquidity required by insurance holding companies. We cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of insurance or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate. We are working for changes in the regulatory environment to make insurance more available and affordable for customers, encourage market innovation, improve driving safety, strengthen cybersecurity and promote better catastrophe preparedness and loss mitigation. Limitations on Dividends by Insurance Subsidiaries\u00a0\u00a0As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate Corporation relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt or to fund non-insurance-related businesses. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois, and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends. However, such laws in some jurisdictions may be more restrictive. For additional information regarding limitations, see Part II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.In addition, the NAIC formed a working group that has developed and adopted a group capital calculation covering all entities of the insurance company group for use in solvency monitoring activities. The calculation is intended to provide analytical information to regulators, and we do not expect potential revisions to impact our current dividend plans. Any increase in the amount of capital or reserves our insurance subsidiaries are required to hold could reduce the amount of future dividends such subsidiaries are able to distribute to the holding company.\u00a0Any reduction in the risk-based capital (\u201cRBC\u201d) ratios of our insurance subsidiaries could also adversely affect their financial strength ratings as determined by statistical rating agencies.Insurance Holding Company Regulation\u00a0\u2013 Change of Control\u00a0\u00a0The Allstate Corporation is a holding company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they write business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of Alabama, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. Additionally, some of these subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled in California and Florida.Generally, the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of \u201ccontrol\u201d of a domestic or commercially domiciled insurer or of any person that controls such an insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of \u201ccontrol\u201d arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurer or of a person who controls an insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non-domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state.

While such pre-acquisition notification  12      www.allstate.com 12      www.allstate.com 12      www.allstate.com Item 1. Business 2022 Form 10-K  Item 1. Business 2022 Form 10-K   statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order with respect to the non-domestic insurer if certain conditions exist, such as undue market concentration.Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporation\u2019s common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in Alabama (where the threshold is five percent or more of The Allstate Corporation\u2019s common stock), California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporation\u2019s common stock.Rate Regulation  Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state\u2019s regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use.The speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or increasing costs depends on the state rating laws, which include the following categories:\u2022Prior approval \u2014 Regulators must approve a rate before the insurer may use it (21 states)\u2022File-and-use \u2014 Insurers do not have to wait for the regulator\u2019s approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used (20 states)\u2022Use-and-file \u2014 Requires an insurer to file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them (9 states)\u2022No approval \u2014 One state, with an immaterial amount of written premiums, does not require a filing to be submitted Under these rating laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing. An insurer\u2019s ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is dependent on an insurer\u2019s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer\u2019s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer\u2019s ability to charge a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer may be able to manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its targeted level of profitability.From time to time, the personal lines insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special-interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs, catastrophe loss exposure, and expenses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. Allstate and other insurers are using increasingly sophisticated pricing models and rating plans that are reviewed by regulators and special-interest groups. States may limit the ability of insurers to include variables in their rating plans even though they are indicative of risk. State regulators may interpret existing law or rely on future legislation or regulations to impose new restrictions that adversely affect profitability or growth. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding insurance rates.Involuntary Markets\u00a0\u00a0As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers.

Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments.Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies\u00a0\u00a0Most states regulate an insurer\u2019s ability to exit a market. For example, states may limit, to varying degrees, an insurer\u2019s ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states restrict or prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department.

Such standards could impact products provided by Allstate agents and Allstate\u2019s broker-dealer, their sales processes, sales volume, and producer compensation arrangements.Inflation Reduction Act of 2022  The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cAct\u201d), which contains several tax-related provisions, was signed into law in August 2022. The Act creates a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cCAMT\u201d) on certain large corporations and an excise tax of 1% on stock repurchases by publicly traded U.S. corporations, both effective after December 31, 2022. The excise tax on common stock repurchases will be classified as an additional cost of the stock acquired included in treasury stock in shareholders' equity. The Company has determined that it is considered an \u201capplicable corporation\u201d under the rules of CAMT, and as such, it is expected to perform the CAMT computation starting January 1, 2023; however, a reasonable estimate cannot be made as of the filing date.Climate disclosures  In March 2022, the SEC released its climate-related proposed regulation, requiring registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The proposed rule would require information about a registrant\u2019s climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. The required information about climate-related risks would also include disclosure of a registrant\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, which have become a commonly used metric to assess a registrant\u2019s exposure to such risks. In addition, under the proposed rule, certain climate-related financial metrics would be required in a registrant\u2019s audited financial statements. The Company is evaluating the anticipated impacts of the proposed guidance to its disclosures.Cybersecurity risk management  The SEC issued a proposed rule in March 2022 to mandate cybersecurity disclosures, including information such as: management's and the board\u2019s role and oversight of cybersecurity risks, policies and procedures and how risks and incidents are likely to impact the financial statements. Additionally, certain incidents would have mandatory reporting on a Form 8-K.

The policy statement affirms the U.S. system of insurance regulation, including the role of state insurance regulators as the primary supervisors of the business of insurance and addresses several other key provisions of the Covered Agreement for which constituents sought clarity, including prospective application to reinsurance agreements and an affirmation that the Covered Agreement does not require development of a group capital standard or group capital requirement in the U.S.The U.S. had five years from the date of signing to amend its credit for reinsurance laws and regulations to conform with the requirements of the Covered Agreement or face federal preemption determinations by the FIO. To address the requirements of the Covered Agreement, the NAIC formally adopted revisions to its existing credit for reinsurance model law and model regulation to conform with the requirements of the Covered Agreement with the expectation that states would adopt and implement the modified model law and regulation by September 2022. A sufficient number of states adopted the model and/or regulation to avoid federal preemption.Division Statute  On November 27, 2018, the Illinois General Assembly passed legislation authorizing a statute that makes available a process by which a domestic insurance company may divide into two or more domestic insurance companies. The statute, which became effective January 1, 2019, can be used to divide continuing blocks of insurance business from insurance business no longer marketed, or otherwise has been discontinued, into separate companies with separate capital. The statute can also be used for sale to a third party or to manage risks associated with indemnification programs. Before a plan of division can be effected it must be approved according to the organizational documents of the dividing insurer and submitted for approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance. Allstate Insurance Company and certain affiliate insurance companies utilized the division statute to form three Illinois domiciled insurance companies that retained assets and liabilities for certain Michigan automobile insurance policies with catastrophic personal injury claims that are ceded to the MCCA.Privacy Regulation and Data Security\u00a0\u00a0Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer information and to notify consumers about their policies and practices relating to collection, use, and disclosure of consumer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of consumer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities are currently considering additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of consumer information.For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, which took effect in January 2023, as well as similar laws in Virginia and Connecticut, adopted significant compliance requirements for businesses in those states. Among other things, the California Privacy Rights Act expanded consumer privacy rights and established a new privacy regulatory agency. In another example, the New York State Department of Financial Services cybersecurity regulation and the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law, which has been adopted in some form by several states, establish standards for data security, including the investigation of and notification to insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events. Additional states are also likely to adopt similarly themed cybersecurity requirements in the future. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative or regulatory measures regarding privacy or cybersecurity. Asbestos\u00a0\u00a0Congress has repeatedly considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.Environmental\u00a0\u00a0Environmental pollution and clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of federal and state regulation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (the \u201cSuperfund\u201d) and comparable state statutes (the \u201cmini-Superfunds\u201d) govern the clean-up and restoration of waste sites by Potentially Responsible Parties (\u201cPRPs\u201d). The Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (collectively, the \u201cEnvironmental Clean-up Laws\u201d or \u201cECLs\u201d) establish a mechanism to assign liability to PRPs or to fund the clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP depends on a variety of factors. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured PRPs and the insured parties\u2019 alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, has disputed and is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether the Superfund response, investigation, and clean-up costs are considered damages under the policies; whether coverage has been triggered; whether any pollution exclusion applies; whether there has been proper notice of claims; whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend; whether there is an appropriate allocation of liability among potentially responsible insurers; and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and waste sites not covered under the Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstate\u2019s exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. While comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, only modest reform measures have been enacted. In May 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency created a Superfund Task Force that issued proposed reforms in  On September 22, 2017, the U.S. and European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) signed a Covered Agreement.
