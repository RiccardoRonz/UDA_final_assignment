We comply with the labor and employment laws of all countries in which we operate, prioritizing fair employment practices, labor compliance, non- 10 10 10 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 discrimination, and equal employment opportunity. The KLM is the framework for how we do business, enabling us to execute on our strategies for the benefit of our customers, stockholders and employees, while operating within our values of Speed and Courage, Uncompromising Integrity, High Performance, Social Responsibility and One Keysight.  We believe our culture, which fosters employee inclusion, engagement, and innovation, is a competitive advantage. We are committed to maintaining a work environment founded on respect for all, regardless of race, color, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, ethnicity, religion, disability, veteran status, national origin, or any protected class. Our Harassment Policy requires that all who work for Keysight be treated with dignity, respect, and courtesy. Our Keysight Standards of Business Conduct (\"SBC\") govern our dealings with our customers, competitors, suppliers, third-party partners, as well as with our fellow employees, and is available for review on our website. Our employees are responsible for upholding the SBC, and SBC training is required annually for all our employees.  Oversight and Governance The Chief People and Administrative Officer (\"CAO\") is responsible for developing and executing the company\u2019s human capital strategy. Our strategy incorporates global policies and programs for leadership and talent development, diversity, equity and inclusion, compensation, benefits, staffing and workforce planning, human resources systems, education, and organization development. The CAO is responsible for developing and integrating the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion priorities and strategy. The Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and CAO regularly update our board of directors and the Compensation and Human Capital Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) on human capital matters.  Hiring, Retention and Succession Planning We understand that Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (\"STEM\") education is critical to creating a pipeline of future engineers. We provide global support for STEM education through a variety of company-sponsored and employee-led programs, which introduce school-age students to engineering. Our talent acquisition and Human Resources teams work with business leaders to understand and align on how our business goals and strategies impact our talent needs. The teams use this information to inform recruiting efforts and to build talent pipelines to support growth. In partnership with the marketing team, we have built a strong company brand utilizing multiple communication platforms to better enable us to attract top talent. We continue to refine and expand our talent acquisition strategies and processes. As part of our talent acquisition strategy, we provide training to recruiters and hiring managers to assist them in recruiting and hiring top talent. We had a global job offer acceptance rate of 86.8 percent in 2023.  Our business leaders are required to periodically evaluate employee contributions to the company and to identify key contributors, as well as those in need of improvement. At least annually, we provide employees with feedback on their performance over the past fiscal year. Working with Human Resources, business leaders develop retention strategies and initiatives to keep critical talent focused and engaged and to minimize attrition. The average tenure of our employees is 12.6 years. Our three-year average employee turnover rate was approximately 7.5 percent and has been lower than the industry average for the past five years. We continue to develop our leadership capability. We have identified core competencies for leadership positions along with a learning and development framework that can help leaders refine their skills. Succession planning sessions are conducted annually in each business and at many levels in the organization, including the executive level. These reviews provide visibility to top talent, potential leadership gaps, and development plans. Globally, many of our employee population is eligible to retire. These employees often have valuable skills and historical information and knowledge transfer is critical. We have knowledge transfer practices and programs to enable us to retain critical knowledge. In the United States, we have programs specifically designed for retirement-ready employees. We have a retirement planning program that provides a severance payment in exchange for extended notice of retirement. Those who are considered critical talent are given an opportunity to gradually reduce hours leading up to retirement, giving us time to transfer critical information and processes. Once retired, these former employees are given the opportunity to consult with us on a limited basis to provide on-going mentoring and training. 11 11 11 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diversity and Equal Employment Policy We are an equal opportunity employer, and we are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment that is free from harassment and discrimination. The value we place on diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DEI\") is a competitive advantage, and it helps us attract and retain the best talent and drive high performance through innovation and collaboration. We benefit from the innovation that results when people with differing experiences, perspectives, and cultures work together. We have a DEI Director who is responsible for driving strategy and for implementing new and ongoing DEI initiatives. To increase the pool of diverse candidates for open positions, we participate in diversity-focused career fairs and conferences in the United States, Asia, and Europe. We identify diversity recruiting business champions who develop business-specific talent acquisition plans, and we have partnerships with universities worldwide that are aligned with our strategic talent needs, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the United States. In an effort to enable employees to be successful, we provide mentoring programs, inclusive benefits, access to employee network groups, and training for every stage of employment. As of October 31, 2023, women represented 31 percent of our global workforce, and underrepresented minorities represented 44.4 percent of the United States workforce. The percentage of leadership positions (Officer, Senior Vice President, Vice President, Senior Manager, Integrating Manager, Operating Manager and Supervisor) held by women globally was 25.2 percent and the percentage of leadership positions held by underrepresented minorities in the United States was 39.9 percent. At the senior executive level (Officer, Senior Vice President, Vice President), 27.6 percent were women and 31.8 percent were underrepresented minorities. Our Board of Directors has eleven members, three of whom are women, and three are self-identified underrepresented minorities. In the rest of the workforce, we seek to expand hiring of women globally and underrepresented minorities in the United States. We established annual hiring goals to improve our workforce diversity. In 2023, 33.9 percent of our global external new hires were women, exceeding our 2023 goal of 33.6 percent. In 2023, 61.1 percent of external new hires in the United States were underrepresented minorities, exceeding our goal of 50.1 percent. For fiscal year 2024, the adjusted hiring goals for global external new women hires is 34.4 percent, and external new underrepresented minorities hires in the United States is 50.1 percent. A metric in our short-term executive compensation program for fiscal year 2024 is tied to the achievement of these goals. To measure achievement of this goal, we use the following definition of underrepresented minorities: Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, or gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.  Learning and Development We believe that learning is a lifelong pursuit that creates a mindset of professional growth and continuous improvement. We prioritize on-the-job learning through stretch assignments, development opportunities, and educational resources. Our employees have access to a wide range of programs, workshops, classes, and resources to help them excel in their careers. Our Keysight University platform offers training and development programs, as well as learning resources. Our Employee Educational Assistance Program provides financial and management support to eligible employees, allowing them to pursue academic degrees related to their field of work.  Many of our employees are required to take annual training courses related to their work, including those pertaining to the environment, data privacy, contributing to an inclusive workplace, and workplace health and safety. We also have leadership development programs including training for new managers and development through ExecOnline. We hold an annual Keysight Executive Development program with senior leaders to align on strategy and key focus areas for the company. Compensation and Benefits We compensate employees with competitive wages and benefit programs designed to meet employee needs. Our compensation and benefit programs are designed to recognize our employees' contributions to value creation and business results. We seek to achieve pay parity across our organization and in 2023 maintained a worldwide women-to-men pay parity of nearly 1:1. Listening to Employees We provide multiple avenues for employee input. Our Open-Door Policy provides employees with direct access to any level of management to discuss ideas, get input on career development, and discuss concerns in a constructive manner. The MyVoice program fosters inclusion through engagement surveys on a variety of topics that give us insight on what employees value and helps us identify where to prioritize our efforts. We also created a global Inclusion Council comprised of employees from all functions across the globe to help formulate our inclusion goals and track our progress. 12 12 12 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Health, Safety and Wellness We strive to maintain a best-in-class work environment and provide a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. We accomplish this through strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety. Our programs include recognition and control of workplace hazards, ergonomics training, a global travel health program, and robust emergency and disaster recovery plans. We promote the health and wellness of our employees through our Employee Well Being programs, our Employee and Family Assistance Program (which includes twelve free sessions with therapists and mental health coaches per year), and workplace accessibility and accommodations.  Backlog Backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue (booked as deferred revenue), and orders for goods that were shipped but not yet recognized, awaiting acceptance by customers and/or completion of a commitment to a customer. At October\u00a031, 2023, our backlog was approximately $2,290\u00a0million compared to approximately $2,550\u00a0million at October\u00a031, 2022. The decrease in year-over-year backlog is a result of revenue outpacing orders, primarily driven by the fulfillment of orders and shipments with the easing of supply chain constraints along with the year-over-year decline in orders. In accordance with our order acceptance policy, we continue to expect the majority of backlog to be recognized as revenue within six months. While backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of short-term revenue performance, it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.  Intellectual Property  We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. Although we believe that our licenses, patents, and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent, or other intellectual property right is in itself material, other than the Keysight mark.   Government Regulations Our company is subject to various federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations relating to the development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and solutions, and it is our policy to comply with the laws in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Regulations include, but are not limited to, those related to environment, corruption, bribery, import and export controls, competition, product safety, workplace health and safety, employment, labor, and data privacy. The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business. For additional information about the risks related to government regulations, please refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Environmental Regulations Our R&D, manufacturing, and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state, and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated, and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging, and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal, and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur additional costs in the future. Some of our properties have been the subject of ongoing remediation by HP Inc. (\"HP\") for subsurface contamination that was known at the time of Agilent\u2019s separation from HP in 1999. In connection with Agilent\u2019s separation from HP, HP and Agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which HP agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. Agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Keysight in respect of facilities transferred to Keysight in our separation from Agilent on November 1, 2014 (the \"Separation\"). As a result, HP has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation. Although HP agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at such properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. In connection with the Separation, Agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that Agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations. On December 17, 2021, Keysight and HP signed a restrictive covenant related to our Santa Rosa facility that prohibits certain uses of the property (such as running a daycare facility, hospital, or school) and terminates HP\u2019s  13 13 13 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 remediation obligation related to that facility. HP\u2019s remediation obligations relating to Keysight\u2019s Colorado Springs facility are ongoing. We maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy that may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations. Import/Export Regulations We sell products and solutions to customers all over the world and are required to comply with the U.S Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs that limit or ban sales into certain countries. Countries outside of the U.S. have implemented similar controls and sanction regulations. Together these controls and regulations may impose licensing requirements on exports of certain technology and software from the U.S. and may impact our ability to transact business in certain countries or with certain customers. We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of these programs and regulations, and we regularly monitor changes in the law and regulations.  On August 3, 2021, we entered into a Consent Agreement with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State to resolve alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR\"). Pursuant to the Consent Agreement, we were assessed a penalty of $6.6\u00a0million to be paid over three years, $2.5\u00a0million of which was suspended and designated for remediation activities over three years, including employment of a special compliance officer. To date, we have paid $3.1 million of the penalty. The suspended portion of the penalty has been satisfied by amounts we have spent on qualifying compliance activities to date.  In February 2022, the U.S. imposed economic sanctions and other restrictions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. As a result, after an initial suspension of operations in Russia, we permanently discontinued our Russian operations and are exiting Russia. Changes in these or other import or export laws and regulations may restrict or further restrict our ability to sell certain products and solutions and may require us to develop additional compliance programs and training. Anti-Corruption Regulations As a result of our extensive international operations, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. We have compliance policies, programs, and training to prevent non-compliance with such anti-corruption regulations in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory changes that may impact our business and develop strategies to address the changes and incorporate them into existing compliance programs.  Data Privacy Regulations  With extensive operations all over the world, we must comply with complex regulations governing data privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union and data privacy regulations in other jurisdictions. These regulations require careful handling of internal data. We have internal data handling policies and practices to comply with global data privacy requirements, including GDPR and similar regulations, and devote resources to keep up with changing data privacy regulations. The risk of data privacy breaches cannot be entirely eliminated, creating risk of fines and penalties. Additionally, new laws, amendments, or interpretations of regulations, industry standards, and contractual obligations relating to data privacy may require us to incur additional costs related to compliance and may restrict our business operations. Health and Safety Regulations We are subject to and comply with health and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations may differ by country, requiring us to keep track of varied and complex requirements. In the U.S. we are subject to federal and state Occupational Health and Safety laws as well as federal, state, and local requirements.
