We will deliver on this vision while offering a competitive total return to shareholders. Our mission is to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy services they want and value at a competitive price.  We execute on our vision and mission through three strategic priorities. LEAD THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITIONENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCEKEEP BILLS LOW Our employees are guided by our four corporate values: Connected, Committed, Safe, and Trustworthy. Our values, culture and Code of Conduct serve as the foundation upon which Xcel Energy\u2019s Board of Directors, employees, contractors and suppliers approach their work in delivering on our three strategic priorities.     5 5 5 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Our sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance commitments are summarized as follows:(1)Spans natural gas supply, delivery and customer use.(2)Includes the Xcel Energy fleet; zero-carbon fuel is electricity or other clean energy.Deliver a Competitive Total Return to InvestorsSuccessful strategy execution, along with our disciplined approach to growth, operations and management of environmental, social and governance issues, positions us to continue delivering a competitive TSR.We have consistently achieved our financial objectives, meeting or exceeding our initial earnings guidance range for 18 consecutive years and delivering dividend growth for 19 consecutive years.Over the past five years, GAAP earnings per share have grown by 7.1% annually and our annual dividend growth was 6.3%. Xcel Energy works to maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range and senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range. Current ratings are consistent with this goal.LEAD THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITIONFor nearly two decades, Xcel Energy has proactively managed the risk of climate change and worked to meet increasing demand for cleaner energy. Carbon-free Electricity by 2050In 2018, Xcel Energy became the first U.S. utility to establish a carbon-free vision, targeting 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 with an interim goal to reduce carbon emissions 80% by 2030 (from 2005 levels), including owned and purchased power. A lead author for the climate change scientific analysis issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed that our vision aligns with science-based scenarios likely to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.Goal includes owned and purchased power.The pace of achieving a carbon-free vision is governed by reliability and customer affordability. Our approved resource plans outline a clear, transparent path for reducing carbon emissions 80% using current technologies, while maintaining customer bill increases at or below the rate of inflation. Moving from 80% carbon reduction to 100% carbon-free electricity will require new dispatchable technologies that are economically viable, as well as supportive public policy. See Item 1A for risks and uncertainties related to strategic and sustainability goals and objectives.Through 2022, we reduced carbon emissions from generation serving customers by an estimated 53% (from 2005 levels) and remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030. Xcel Energy will be coal-free by year-end 2030, pending the approval of the proposed acceleration of the Tolk coal plant retirement to 2028. As we transition to clean energy, service reliability is a priority. Xcel Energy was ranked in the top quartile for customer reliability as determined in the 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Annual Benchmarking Study.Xcel Energy\u2019s wind capacity is now over 11,000 MW, including nearly 4,500 MW of owned wind. Our fleet continues to demonstrate high wind availability with 2022 performance at approximately 97%, while saving customers over $3 billion in fuel related costs and PTCs since 2017.In 2022, Minnesota and Colorado commissions approved resource plans that will add nearly 10,000 MW of utility-scale renewable energy to our systems. Beyond carbon emissions, we have significantly reduced other emissions and environmental impacts. Notable environmental improvements include:*Reductions in water consumption are from owned and purchased electricity that serves our customers. All other reductions are from owned generating plants.**Coal ash and water consumption data are as of 2021.As we prepare for early coal plant retirements, employees are provided advanced notice and offered retraining and relocation opportunities. To date, we have been successful in avoiding lay offs associated with our early coal plant retirements. We also help foster economic development opportunities to offset community economic impacts associated with coal plant closures. Xcel Energy has a long track record of working with our communities on energy, climate and environmental initiatives that impact them and has publicly committed to furthering environmental justice.

Xcel Energy has a long track record of working with our communities on energy, climate and environmental initiatives that impact them and has publicly committed to furthering environmental justice. 6 6 6 Table of Contents  Table of Contents       7 7 7 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Significant transmission expansion will also be required to enable the clean energy transition, and Xcel Energy is already investing towards its goals. For example, our $2 billion Pathway project in Colorado will provide over 560 miles of transmission lines and enable nearly 5,500 MW of new renewable energy. In addition, as part of MISO\u2019s planned transmission expansion over the next decade, Xcel Energy has been awarded $1.2 billion of projects as part of Tranche 1.Natural Gas Use in Buildings \u2013 Net Zero GHG by 2050In 2021, we committed to reduce GHG emissions 25% by 2030 (from 2020 levels) and provide net-zero natural gas service by 2050 from the supply, distribution and end-use of natural gas. Similar to our electric plan, our vision to deliver gas service with net-zero emissions by 2050 aligns with science-based scenarios likely to limit warming by 1.5 C.Our net-zero natural gas strategy includes:\u2022Working with suppliers to purchase only low emissions gas supply by 2030.\u2022Operating the cleanest possible system to achieve net-zero methane emissions on the system by 2030.\u2022Offering customer options that promote conservation, encourage electrification, where beneficial, and incorporate clean fuels such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas.\u2022Applying high quality carbon offsets through projects that remove emissions from other parts of the economy while providing additional environmental and social benefit.Electrification of the Transportation SectorIn addition to transitioning our own generation fleet, we are helping to decarbonize other sectors, starting with transportation. We aim to enable one out of five vehicles in our service areas to be electric by 2030, representing a nearly $2 billion investment, 0.6% to 0.7% incremental annual retail sales growth and avoidance of roughly 5 million tons of CO2 emissions annually. By 2050, our vision is to run all vehicles in our service area with carbon-free electricity or other clean energy. We have launched new products and services across our service territories. In addition, we have an approved, transportation electrification plan in Colorado and comprehensive transportation plans in Minnesota and Wisconsin that are pending commission approval. Innovation and PolicyPassage of the IRA is expected to reduce the cost of renewables for our customers, improve the competitiveness of our renewable projects and improve liquidity and credit metrics. The IRA is expected to reduce the cost of future wind projects by 50-60% and solar projects by 25-40% (levelized cost of energy basis). The IRA also lowers the costs of hydrogen production that could be used for generation and the natural gas system. Finally, the IRA is likely to provide customers additional benefits from PTCs for the generation of electricity from our nuclear fleet. New and emerging technologies are foundational to fulfilling our strategic priorities. Advancement of economical, resilient and reliable zero-carbon 24/7 power technologies, as well as advanced storage and new low-carbon fuels, are needed to deliver on our clean energy goals by 2050. We actively monitor and participate in emerging and advanced energy technologies through collaborations with researchers, technology developers, venture investors and others in our industry. We have several initiatives, pilots and demonstration projects underway that are advancing and testing the real-world applications of cutting-edge technologies. Our recently announced partnership with Form Energy to develop two 10 MW, 100-hour energy storage pilot projects is an example.ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCEXcel Energy has a comprehensive suite of renewable and conservation programs that provide customers with clean energy options and help keep their bills low. We are also transforming and expanding our electric grid to accommodate load growth, renewable energy and distributed energy resources. We are in the process of installing smart meters, which will deliver numerous customer and operational benefits, providing near-real-time communication, allowing customers to know how much energy they are using and what it will cost them. Along with the smart meters, customers will have new digital tools to make it easier to access their energy information, gain useful insights to better understand and manage their energy use and make smarter energy choices that lower their bills.KEEP BILLS LOWCustomer affordability is critical to successful strategy execution. From 2013 - 2022, we have kept residential electric bill growth to 1.8% per year and below the rate of inflation. Residential gas bills were near flat, growing 0.3% per year from 2013 - 2021. Global pressures on natural gas prices increased customer natural gas bills in 2022. We pass the cost of natural gas directly to customers (without markup) through fuel clauses in most of our states, and higher gas prices affected the affordability of the service we provide. We have taken several steps to address this concern: \u2022Low-income customers are eligible to receive assistance with their bills. In 2022, we set a company record for energy assistance outreach as 193,000 customers were connected to programs that provided $216 million in funding.\u2022Xcel Energy has invested more than $2 billion over the past decade in a comprehensive suite of electric and natural gas conservation programs.\u2022We also kept O&M expenses flat from 2014 through 2021. While O&M increased in 2022 due to global inflation pressures and other drivers, our goal is to reduce 2023 O&M expenses 2% from 2022 levels and keep them relatively flat thereafter.\u2022We continue to invest to reduce operating costs through ongoing process and technology improvements, including the use of drone technologies, automated work processes, artificial intelligence and continuous improvement methodologies. \u2022In addition, we are augmenting our One Xcel Energy Way program in 2023, which we expect to drive increased productivity and efficiency across all levels of the Company.\u2022As previously discussed, our geographic advantages in wind and solar also enable customer savings, which we call our \u201cSteel for Fuel\u201d strategy.

No municipalization activities are occurring presently.  14 14 14 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  While each utility subsidiary faces these challenges, Xcel Energy believes their rates and services are competitive with alternatives currently available.Governmental RegulationsPublic Utility RegulationSee Item 7 for discussion of public utility regulation.Environmental RegulationOur facilities are regulated by federal and state agencies that have jurisdiction over air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous wastes or substances. Certain Xcel Energy activities require registrations, permits, licenses, inspections and approvals from these agencies. Xcel Energy has received necessary authorizations for the construction and continued operation of its generation, transmission and distribution systems. Our facilities strive to operate in compliance with applicable environmental standards and related monitoring and reporting requirements. However, it is not possible to determine what additional facilities or modifications to existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes to regulations, interpretations or enforcement policies or what effect future laws or regulations may have. We may be required to incur expenditures in the future for remediation of historic and current operating sites and other waste treatment, storage and disposal sites. There are significant environmental regulations to encourage use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs. We have undertaken numerous initiatives to meet current requirements and prepare for potential future regulations, reduce GHG emissions and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. Future environmental regulations may result in substantial costs. Emerging Environmental RegulationClean Air Act \u2014 In April 2022, the EPA proposed regulations under the \"Good Neighbor\" provisions of the Clean Air Act. The proposed rules apply to Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin. The proposal establishes an allowance trading program for NOx, potentially impacting Xcel Energy fossil fuel generating facilities. Under the proposed rule, facilities without NOx controls will have to secure additional allowances, install NOx controls, or develop a strategy of operations that utilizes the existing allowance allocations. The EPA has indicated that it intends for the rule to be final and applicable in the first half of 2023. While the financial impacts of the proposed regulation are uncertain and dependent on market forces, Xcel Energy anticipates that costs will be approximately $60 million annually and will be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms based on prior state commission practices.In a June 2022 ruling, the United States Supreme Court held that an economy-wide approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants was not consistent with the Clean Air Act. Therefore, if the EPA proceeds with new rules, it cannot set a standard based on economy-wide generation shifting to other sources, such as renewable energy. It is anticipated that EPA will propose rules to limit GHG emissions from new and existing coal and natural gas-fired electric generating units in 2023. If any new rules require additional investment, Xcel Energy believes that the cost of these initiatives or replacement generation would be recoverable through rates based on prior state commission practices.Coal Ash Regulation \u2014 In February 2023, the EPA entered into a Consent Decree, committing the agency to either issue new proposed rules by May 5, 2023, to regulate inactive CCR landfills under the CCR Rule for the first time, or to determine no such rules are necessary by that date. If proposed rules are issued in May, the EPA has committed to a May 2024 effective date for the new rules. Until proposed rules are issued, it is not certain what the impact will be on Xcel Energy, but we anticipate that additional inactive ash units could become regulated for the first time. It is also anticipated that the EPA may issue other CCR proposed rules in 2023 that further expand the scope of the CCR Rule.Emerging Contaminants of Concern \u2014 PFAS are man-made chemicals that are widely used in consumer products and can persist and bio-accumulate in the environment. Xcel Energy does not manufacture PFAS but because PFAS are so ubiquitous in products and the environment, it may impact our operations. In September 2022, the EPA proposed to designate two types of PFAS as \u201chazardous substances\u201d under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, specifically perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. This proposed rule could result in new obligations for investigation and cleanup wherever PFAS are found to be present. The impact the proposed regulation may have on electric and gas utilities is currently uncertain.Environmental CostsEnvironmental costs include amounts for nuclear plant decommissioning and payments for storage of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites, monitoring of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to emissions.Costs charged to operating expenses for nuclear decommissioning, spent nuclear fuel disposal, environmental monitoring and remediation and disposal of hazardous materials and waste and depreciation of previously incurred capital expenditures for environmental improvements were approximately:\u2022$365 million in 2022.\u2022$365 million in 2021.\u2022$400 million in 2020.Average annual expense of approximately $430 million from 2023 \u2013 2027 is estimated for similar costs. The precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate.Capital expenditures for environmental improvements were approximately:\u2022$20 million in 2022.\u2022$60 million in 2021.\u2022$30 million in 2020.Certain previously collected nuclear storage costs for the federal nuclear waste program are reimbursed to customers by the federal government as a result of a settlement we pursued regarding the government\u2019s failure to deliver a disposal program. Installments received are reimbursed to customers as approved by the MPUC and other state regulators.

Risks that may adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. These risks should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and future reports that we file with the SEC. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. Oversight of Risk and Related ProcessesThe Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of material risk and maintaining an effective risk monitoring process. Management and the Board of Directors\u2019 committees have responsibility for overseeing the identification and mitigation of key risks and reporting its assessments and activities to the full Board of Directors.Xcel Energy maintains a robust compliance program and promotes a culture of compliance beginning with the tone at the top. The risk mitigation process includes adherence to our Code of Conduct and compliance policies, operation of formal risk management structures and overall business management. Xcel Energy further mitigates inherent risks through formal risk committees and corporate functions such as internal audit, and internal controls over financial reporting and legal. Management identifies and analyzes risks to determine materiality and other attributes such as timing, probability and controllability. Identification and risk analysis occurs formally through risk assessment conducted by senior management, the financial disclosure process, hazard risk procedures, internal audit and compliance with financial and operational controls. Management also identifies and analyzes risk through the business planning process, development of goals and establishment of key performance indicators, including identification of barriers to implementing Xcel Energy\u2019s strategy. The business planning process also identifies likelihood and mitigating factors to prevent the assumption of inappropriate risk to meet goals.Management communicates regularly with the Board of Directors and key stakeholders regarding risk. Senior management presents and communicates a periodic risk assessment to the Board of Directors, providing information on the risks that management believes are material, including financial impact, timing, likelihood and mitigating factors. The Board of Directors regularly reviews management\u2019s key risk assessments, which includes areas of existing and future macroeconomic, financial, operational, policy, environmental, safety and security risks. The oversight, management and mitigation of risk is an integral and continuous part of the Board of Directors\u2019 governance of Xcel Energy. The Board of Directors assigns oversight of critical risks to each of its four committees to confirm these risks are well understood and given appropriate focus. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the adequacy of the committees\u2019 risk oversight and affirming appropriate aggregate oversight occurs. Committees regularly report on their oversight activities and certain risk issues may be brought to the full Board of Directors for consideration when deemed appropriate.Emerging risks are considered and assigned as appropriate during the annual Board of Directors and committee evaluation process, resulting in updates to the committee charters and annual work plans. Additionally, the Board of Directors conducts an annual strategy session where Xcel Energy\u2019s future plans and initiatives are reviewed.Risks Associated with Our BusinessOperational RisksOur natural gas and electric generation/transmission and distribution operations involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.Our natural gas transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions, outages and mechanical problems. Our electric generation, transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks such as contact, fire and outages. These risks could result in loss of life, significant property damage, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses to employees, third-party contractors, customers or the public. We maintain insurance against most, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of these events, if not fully covered by insurance, could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as potential loss of reputation.Other uncertainties and risks inherent in operating and maintaining Xcel Energy's facilities include, but are not limited to:\u2022Risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned. \u2022Failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other supplies. \u2022Impact of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including, tornadoes, icing events, floods and droughts. \u2022Performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency.\u2022Availability of replacement equipment. \u2022Availability of adequate water resources and ability to satisfy water intake and discharge requirements. \u2022Availability or changes to wind patterns. \u2022Inability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects. \u2022Use of new or unproven technology. \u2022Risks associated with dependence on a specific type of fuel or fuel source, such as commodity price risk, availability of adequate fuel supply and transportation and lack of available alternative fuel sources.\u2022Increased competition due to, among other factors, new facilities, excess supply, shifting demand and regulatory changes.
