(the Parent) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, Invesco or the company) is an independent investment management firm dedicated to delivering an investment experience that helps people get more out of life. Our comprehensive range of active, passive and alternative investment capabilities has been constructed over many years to help clients achieve their investment objectives. We draw on this comprehensive range of capabilities to provide customized solutions designed to deliver key outcomes aligned to client needs.  With approximately 8,600 employees and an on-the-ground presence in more than 20 countries, Invesco is well positioned to meet the needs of investors across the globe. We have specialized investment teams managing investments across a broad range of asset classes, investment styles and geographies. For decades, individuals and institutions have viewed Invesco as a trusted partner for a comprehensive set of investment needs. We have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC), serving clients in more than 110 countries. As of December\u00a031, 2022, the firm managed approximately $1.4 trillion in assets for investors around the world.  The key drivers of success for Invesco are long-term investment performance, high-quality client service and effective distribution relationships delivered across a diverse spectrum of investment management capabilities, distribution channels, geographic areas and market exposures. Through our focus on these areas, we seek to deliver better outcomes for clients and generate competitive investment results, positive net flows, increased AUM and associated revenues.  We measure relative investment performance by comparing our investment capabilities to competitors' products, industry benchmarks and client investment objectives. Generally, distributors, investment advisors and consultants take into consideration longer-term investment performance (e.g., three-year and five-year performance) in their selection of investment products and manager recommendations to their clients. Third-party ratings may also influence client investment decisions. We monitor the quality of client service in a variety of ways, including periodic client satisfaction surveys, analysis of response times and redemption rates, competitive benchmarking of services and feedback from investment consultants.  The company is organized under the laws of Bermuda. Our common shares are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol \u201cIVZ.\u201d We maintain a website at www.invesco.com/corporate.

As an integrated global investment manager, we are keenly focused on meeting clients' needs and operating effectively and efficiently. We take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment \u201cinvestment management.\u201d  We believe one of Invesco's greatest strengths is our separate, distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe. A key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain well-performing investment capabilities. We believe the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm.  Industry Trends  Trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes:  \u2022Distribution partners are becoming more selective and continuing to maintain fewer relationships and partners, reducing the number of trusted investment managers with whom they work. Invesco provides a comprehensive range of capabilities, a robust set of value-added services and investment solutions that deliver key outcomes aligned to their investment objectives.  \u2022Clients and distribution partners are also demanding more from investment managers. While investment performance remains paramount, competitive pricing, client engagement and value-added services (including portfolio analytics and consultative solutions) increasingly differentiate managers. Clients and distribution partners are also increasingly discerning and focused on greater value for their money. Invesco delivers competitive pricing, investor education, thought leadership, digital platforms and other value-added services that enhance the client experience. The firm is also working to enhance the client user experience through digital marketing (web, mobile, social) and improved service.  \u2022Investors continue to demand alternative, passive and smart beta strategies. As a consequence, the industry is seeing client demand for certain active core equities portfolios decline as a share of global flows. Invesco is the 4th largest exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provider globally. Invesco sponsors 72 ETFs each with greater than $500 million in AUM. Invesco also has a strong lineup of alternative and multi-asset strategies supported by ongoing product development. \u2022Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing is one of the fastest-growing segments of the asset management industry. Invesco offers a broad range of ESG investment capabilities, which enables clients to align their investments with their values. Our approach is \"client-led\" and \"investment-driven\" \u2013 that is, we seek to offer clients investment products tailored to their specific investment objectives. We offer a broad range of ESG capabilities for clients seeking strategies that align with their interests and investment objectives. We deliver these capabilities through equities, fixed income, multi-asset, alternatives, real estate, ETFs and custom solutions. We also integrate financially material ESG considerations in our investment capabilities.  \u2022The asset management industry is experiencing pressure on net revenue yield, arising from increased use of low-fee passive products and further concentration within channel distribution partners (which increases their ability to negotiate pricing). \u2022Regulatory activity remains at increased levels and is influencing competitive dynamics. Increased regulatory scrutiny of asset managers has focused on many areas, including transparency/unbundling of fees, inducements, conflicts of interest, capital, liquidity, solvency, leverage, operational risk management, controls and compensation. Invesco continues to work proactively with regulators around the world to better understand and help shape the evolving regulatory landscape. Efforts to further modernize and strengthen our global platform will enhance our ability to  3 3 3 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 compete effectively across markets while complying with the variety of applicable regulatory regimes. This is a key differentiator for large, scaled firms such as Invesco. \u2022Although the developed markets in the U.S. and Europe are the two largest markets for financial assets by a wide margin, other key emerging markets in the world, such as Greater China, are growing faster and are positioned for greater future growth over the long term. In particular, the Chinese mutual fund management industry has grown from zero to nearly $4 trillion, and it is expected to become the second-largest fund management market in the world by 2025 with nearly $6 trillion in assets. Building on nearly two decades' presence in the market, Invesco is the largest foreign-owned asset manager with an onshore presence in China. Additionally, population age differences between emerging and developed markets will result in differing investment needs and horizons among countries. Asset allocation and retirement savings schemes also differ substantially among countries. We believe firms such as Invesco, with experience across a variety of key markets and diversified investment capabilities and product types, are best positioned to meet clients' needs in this global competitive landscape. \u2022Technology advances are impacting core elements of the investment management industry, which lags other industries in its use of technology. Clients increasingly seek to interact digitally with their investment portfolios. This is leading to established managers investing in and/or acquiring technology platforms. As the investment management business becomes more complex, automation will become increasingly important to serve clients effectively and efficiently. Invesco is leveraging technology across its business and exploring opportunities to work with third-party technology firms to enhance our clients' investment experience. In addition, over the past few years, Invesco has made investments in its digital wealth business, intelliflo.  These dynamics are driving fundamental changes within the industry and, we believe, will drive increasing consolidation. We believe the steps we have taken over the past decade strengthened our ability to understand, anticipate and meet client needs and will help ensure Invesco is well-positioned to compete within our industry over the long term.  Investment Management Capabilities  We believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their well-defined investment disciplines and risk management approaches provide us with a robust competitive advantage. There are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as Invesco's and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles. We offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage. Our asset classes, broadly defined, include equity, fixed income, balanced, alternatives and money market. We offer custom solutions across all asset classes and increasingly incorporate financially material ESG considerations into our investment capabilities and processes. Our Global ESG team provides support and analysis, while our investment managers maintain discretion on portfolio decisions. 4 4 4 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table of Contents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following sets forth our major managed investment objectives by asset class:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equity\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fixed Income\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Balanced\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AlternativesMoney Market\u25cf Custom Solutions\u25cf Custom Solutions\u25cf Custom Solutions\u25cf Custom Solutions\u25cf Custom Solutions\u25cf Environmental, Social and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Governance\u25cf Environmental, Social and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Governance \u25cf Environmental, Social and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Governance\u25cf Environmental, Social and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Governance\u25cf Cash Plus\u25cf Core/Value/Growth Style\u25cf Buy and Hold\u25cf Balanced Risk\u25cf Absolute Return\u25cf Government/Treasury\u25cf Emerging Markets\u25cf Convertibles\u25cf Global/Regional\u25cf Commodities\u25cf Prime\u25cf International/Global\u25cf Core/Core Plus\u25cf Single Country\u25cf Currencies\u25cf Taxable\u25cf Large/Mid/Small Cap\u25cf Emerging Markets\u25cf Target Date\u25cf Direct Lending\u25cf Tax-Free\u25cf Low Volatility/Defensive\u25cf Government Bonds\u25cf Target Risk\u25cf Distressed Debt\u25cf Passive/Enhanced\u25cf High-Yield Bonds\u25cf Traditional Balanced\u25cf Financial Structures\u25cf Regional/Single Country\u25cf International/Global\u25cf Global Macro\u25cf Smart Beta/Factor-based\u25cf Investment Grade Credit\u25cf Infrastructure and MLPs\u25cf Thematic/Sector\u25cf Multi-Sector\u25cf Long/Short Equity\u25cf Municipal Bonds\u25cf Managed Futures\u25cf Passive/Enhanced\u25cf Multi-Alternatives\u25cf Regional/Single Country\u25cf Private Real Estate\u25cf Short/Ultra-Short Duration\u25cf Public Real Estate Securities \u25cf Stable Value\u25cf Senior Secured Loans\u25cf Structured Securities\u25cf Smart Beta/Factor-based \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equity \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fixed Income \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Balanced \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alternatives  Distribution Channels  Retail AUM typically originate from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units.

As of December\u00a031, 2022, the company had 8,611 employees with an on-the-ground presence in over 20 countries (December\u00a031, 2021: 8,513). Our employees are not covered under collective bargaining agreements.  The company is committed to reducing our impact on the environment. Across Invesco offices, we carefully manage our operational activities with a focus on using natural resources wisely, increasing efficiencies wherever possible and providing a safe and healthy workplace for employees and visitors. This is the foundation of our environmental, health and safety management approach.  Competition   The investment management business is highly competitive, with points of differentiation including investment performance, fees, range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, depth and continuity of relationships and quality of service. We compete with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, investment banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds, insurance companies and, increasingly, firms outside the traditional financial services industry, such as technology providers. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and higher brand recognition than Invesco. However, we believe our experience as a trusted partner to clients, the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities, product types and channels of distribution, and our commitment to innovation enable us to compete effectively in the global investment management business. There are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as Invesco's and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles. We offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage. We also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage, as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute and/or service those products. Lastly, we believe continued execution against our strategic objectives will further strengthen our long-term competitive position.  Management Contracts  We derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts. Fees vary with the type of assets being managed, with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts, along with real estate and other alternative asset products, and lower fees earned on fixed income, money market and stable value accounts and ETFs. Investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days' notice. Typically, retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice and institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with investment managers or reduce the aggregate amount of AUM with very short notice periods.  Risk Management  Invesco is committed to continually strengthening and evolving our risk management approach and activities to ensure they keep pace with business change and client expectations. We believe a key factor in our ability to manage through challenging market conditions and significant business change is our integrated and global approach to risk management. We seek to embed risk management in our day-to-day decision-making as well as our strategic planning process, while our global risk management framework seeks to enable consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up, down and across the company.  Our framework leverages two governance structures: (i) our Global Performance and Risk Committee oversees the management of core investment risks; and (ii) our Enterprise Risk Management Committee oversees the management of all other business- and strategy-related risks. A network of regional, business unit and risk-specific management committees, with oversight by the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, provides ongoing identification, assessment, management and monitoring of existing and emerging risks across all domains of our business.
