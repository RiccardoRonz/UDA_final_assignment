{"cik": 1278021, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business.  Overview MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cMarketAxess\u201d) operates leading electronic trading platforms delivering greater trading efficiency, a diversified pool of liquidity and significant cost savings to our clients across the global fixed-income markets. Over 2,000 institutional investor and broker-dealer firms use our patented trading technology to efficiently trade U.S. high-grade bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds, emerging market debt, Eurobonds, municipal bonds, U.S. government bonds and other fixed-income securities. Our award-winning Open Trading\u00ae marketplace is widely regarded as the preferred all-to-all trading solution in the global credit markets, creating a unique liquidity pool for a broad range of credit market participants. Drawing on a diverse set of trading protocols, including request-for-quote, live order books, sessions-based trading and portfolio trading solutions, as well as our deep data and analytical resources, we believe that we connect the most robust network of participants through an advanced full trading lifecycle solution that also includes automated trading solutions, intelligent data and index products and a range of post-trade services. We operate in a large and rapidly growing market that provides us with a significant opportunity for future growth. Many of our largest current product areas, and areas of future growth, have relatively low levels of trading electronification, which further increases the size of our addressable market. Our platforms\u2019 innovative technology solutions are designed to capitalize on this addressable market by increasing the number of potential trading counterparties and providing our clients with a menu of solutions to address the full lifecycle of fixed-income trading. We offer all-to-all trading (\u201cOpen Trading\u201d) and automated trading solutions for most of our products. We believe that Open Trading drives meaningful price improvement for our clients and reduces risk in fixed-income markets by creating a global, diversified pool of liquidity whereby our institutional investor clients, dealer clients and alternative liquidity providers can all interact on an anonymous basis. Institutional investors can also send trading inquiries directly to their traditional broker-dealer counterparties on a disclosed basis (\u201cdisclosed RFQ\u201d), while simultaneously accessing additional counterparties through our anonymous Open Trading solutions.  We also provide a number of integrated and actionable data offerings, including Composite+\u0099 and Axess All\u00ae, to assist clients with real-time pricing and trading decisions and transaction cost analysis. We have a range of post-trade services, including straight-through processing, trade matching, trade publication, regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across fixed-income and other products.  In 2022, 89.3% of our revenues were derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms. We also derive revenues from information services, post-trade services and other income. Our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and communication expenses, professional and consulting fees, occupancy, marketing and advertising, clearing costs and general and administrative expenses. \u00a0 3 \u00a0 Our History  MarketAxess has been an innovative leader in electronic trading since its founding in 2000. Throughout our history, our primary goals have remained the same: improve trading efficiency and deliver meaningful transaction price improvement for our clients. Prior to our founding, our institutional investor clients were able to trade bonds by telephone with a limited set of broker-dealers with which they had institutional relationships. By 2007, our platforms enabled institutional investors to trade electronically with over thirty broker-dealers. During the financial crisis, we significantly expanded the number of non-primary and regional dealers providing liquidity on our platforms, as many dealers were forced to reduce their balance sheets for market making. Today, we are an S&P 500 company that, through our Open Trading protocols, provides an expanded liquidity pool for over 1,700 global market participants to trade a wide variety of fixed-income securities with each other. \u00a0 \u00a0 Our Competitive Strengths We believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths, including:  Significant Trading Volumes with Participation by Leading Broker-Dealers and Institutional Investors  Our electronic trading platforms provide access to the liquidity generated by the participation of our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients, including substantially all of the leading broker-dealers in global fixed-income trading. We believe these broker-dealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for credit and rates products. We believe that our broker-dealer clients are incentivized to use our platforms due to the ability to efficiently transact with valuable client order flow and the ability to use our Open Trading protocols to help manage their risk, source liquidity and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients.  Our total credit trading volume increased from approximately $1.7 trillion in 2018 to $2.9 trillion in 2022 and our estimated share of U.S. high-grade and high-yield corporate bond volume has increased from 18.1% and 8.9%, respectively, in 2018, to 21.3% and 17.9%, respectively, in 2022. Approximately 91.0% of credit volume on our platforms during 2022 was executed by institutional clients with the remaining 9.0% of credit volume conducted between dealers. 4 \u00a0 Open Trading is a Differentiator that Expands the Liquidity Pool and Drives Price Improvement for Broker-Dealers and Institutional Investors  Liquidity has remained a persistent concern for market participants as regulators raised bank capital requirements and adopted other measures that prompted many dealers to reduce market-making activities even as the buy-side\u2019s bond holdings have grown rapidly. In this environment, Open Trading, our fully electronic, all-to-all trading functionality, has emerged as one solution to the liquidity problem. Open Trading participants have broader and more diverse liquidity options compared to the traditional model of bilateral trading with a limited set of dealer counterparties. The expanded pool of liquidity providers includes investment managers, global dealers, regional dealers and specialist market making and proprietary trading firms. During 2022, over 1,700 firms participated in Open Trading, which improved the ability of both dealers and institutional investors to find natural and opportunistic matches, move orders more efficiently, and achieve significant increases in execution quality and price improvement. We believe our Open Trading protocols enhance our institutional investor clients\u2019 ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all of our Open Trading participants to interact with each other, thereby increasing the potential sources of liquidity available for each participant, as well as the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response. We estimate that Open Trading generated $945.3 million of price improvement for our clients in 2022, consisting of an estimated $653.2 million of liquidity taker price improvement (defined as the difference between the winning price and the best disclosed dealer cover price) and an estimated $292.1 million of liquidity provider price improvement (defined as the difference between the winning price and then current Composite+ bid or offer level, offer if the provider is buying, bid if provider is selling) at the time of the inquiry. This Open Trading price improvement is in addition to the potential cost savings institutional investors can achieve by simultaneously requesting bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients via our traditional disclosed RFQ protocol. In addition, dealers use Open Trading as a source of liquidity to efficiently transfer risk and achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover, which may limit their credit exposure.  Growing, Comprehensive International Offering and Client Base Our platforms provide global fixed-income market participants with trading functionality across Eurobond and emerging markets credit and rates markets, connecting clients in over 80 countries to local and global dealers. MarketAxess has over 1,000 active client firms located outside the U.S. that access our platforms through our regulated venues in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Our Open Trading functionality allows international clients to access cross-border liquidity more efficiently with few regulatory hurdles. The MarketAxess emerging markets trading platform also offers the most comprehensive offering for local currency bond trading across the Latin America, Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia-Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d) regions. Our platforms provide clients with the ability to trade emerging market local currency debt denominated in 29 local currencies with over 140 broker-dealers. In 2021, we extended our global fixed-income trading network to China\u2019s bond market enabling global investor clients to access the China Interbank Bond Market (\u201cCIBM\u201d) via the connection between China Foreign Exchange Trade System (\u201cCFETS\u201d) and MarketAxess under the Bond Connect and CIBM Direct schemes. This arrangement allows clients to trade directly with onshore market makers in China, thus broadening access to liquidity in global emerging markets debt. Robust, Scalable Technology Throughout the Full Trading Cycle We have developed proprietary technology that is designed to be highly secure, fault tolerant and scalable for substantial growth. Our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume, products and clients with relatively little modification and low incremental costs. We have consistently used our proprietary technology to find new ways for our clients to trade more effectively and efficiently. Our core software solutions assist clients with trade execution, as well as pre- and post-trade services. We believe these technologies allow our clients to execute trades more efficiently, while simultaneously capitalizing on price improvement opportunities that can be achieved through our Open Trading functionality. To further support more efficient trade execution, we also offer several automated trading protocols, which allow clients to set eligibility criteria for their orders that our platforms will use to determine whether or not to execute a trade in accordance with the pre-defined parameters. We believe that these automated trading protocols reduce trading inefficiencies and human errors while allowing traders to focus on higher-value trades. In addition to services directly related to the execution of trades, we also offer our clients several other pre- and post-trade services. In the pre-trade period, our platforms assist participants with price discovery by providing them with dealer pricing and real-time and historical trade data. Following the execution of a trade, our platforms support all of the essential tools and functionalities to enable our participants to achieve straight through processing (\u201cSTP\u201d) for trade settlement and to measure transaction costs to evidence best execution. The Company is focused on investing in our resiliency, scale and risk management systems. We also prioritize continuing product delivery on current technologies, delivering approximately 710 unique new business and technical features to our clients during the year ended December 31, 2022. 5 \u00a0 Next Generation Data and Analytical Tools Supporting the Increasing Automation of Trading Workflows Our data and analytical tools enhance the value proposition of our trading platforms and improve the trading experience of our clients. We support our clients\u2019 trading functions by offering value-added analytics that rely on machine-learning, automation and algorithms that are designed to improve the trading decisions and workflows of our clients. Our data and analytical tools are designed to help clients make better trading decisions, benefiting our current clients and attracting new market participants to our network. For example, our Auto-X and Auto-Responder solutions allow traders to execute their smaller trades more efficiently, allowing clients to focus their attention on higher-value trades. Our Strategy  Our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platforms for fixed-income securities, allowing broker-dealers and institutional investors to connect, trade and achieve price improvement more easily and efficiently, while offering a broad array of information, trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle. The key elements of our strategy are:  Increase Penetration in Credit Markets  We believe that we have a large opportunity remaining to capture additional market share in the credit product markets in which we have already established a leadership position. For example, the estimated Composite Corporate Bond average daily trading volume on our platforms for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $9.4 billion, representing just 19.9% of the estimated addressable market of approximately $47.5 billion. The traditional methods of bilateral trading, including the telephone, e-mail or instant messaging, continue to be one of our principal competitors in the credit markets in which we have established a leadership position. We continue to focus on capturing additional market share across our core credit markets. \u201cComposite Corporate Bond\u201d refers to our combined U.S. High Grade, U.S. High Yield, emerging markets and Eurobonds product areas. Continue Expansion into New Product Areas  By leveraging our Open Trading functionality and capitalizing on our experience of building market share in markets like U.S high-grade and U.S. high-yield bonds, we plan to increase our product footprint in newer product areas, including emerging market local currency bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. government bonds, European government bonds and Chinese government bonds. Each of these markets has unique trading protocols, market structures and settlement solutions that require a lengthy ramp-up period, but which will provide diverse revenue sources if we can obtain significant market share. For example, in 2021, we acquired MuniBrokers LLC (\u201cMuniBrokers\u201d), a central electronic trading venue serving municipal bond inter-dealer brokers and dealers, in order to expand our existing municipal bond trading solution. The acquisition connects our leading trading technology with the liquidity of one of the industry\u2019s largest electronic inter-dealer marketplaces, creating a compelling and diverse liquidity solution that we believe will ultimately deliver an improved execution experience.  Expand Trading Protocols and Leverage the Open Trading Network  We believe that we are the only fixed-income electronic trading platform that embraces all-to-all trading in each of our product areas. Open Trading exponentially increases the number of potential trading counterparties by allowing both our broker-dealer clients and institutional investor clients to interact in an all-to-all trading environment of over 1,700 firms. Our clients executed approximately $939.6 billion in credit trading volume using Open Trading during 2022, representing 35.9% of total eligible credit trading volume on our platforms, and realized approximately $945.3 million in estimated price improvement through this unique liquidity solution in 2022. We believe that the combination of Open Trading and our vast client network provides the basis for MarketAxess to enhance liquidity and improve market resiliency in global fixed-income markets.  Continue to Invest in and Grow our Business through Geographic Diversification We are continuing to expand and diversify our business internationally. Our revenues from international clients have grown from 15.7% of total revenue in 2018 to 19.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients are based in over 80 countries with over 1,000 total active international client firms and 5,528 total active international traders. We offer cross-regional electronic trading services in U.S fixed-income markets for international clients, as well as in Eurobonds and emerging market debt. By offering liquidity in both hard-currency and local currency emerging market debt, we have created an efficient emerging market trading ecosystem for our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients. In the last five years, we have seen significant growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d), Latin America and APAC regions. The average daily trading volume in the EMEA, Latin America and APAC regions on the MarketAxess platforms has grown from $1.8 billion in 2018 to $3.7 billion in 2022. We believe we can increase our penetration and revenue opportunities in international markets by continuing to invest in creating client relationships abroad. \u00a0 6 \u00a0 Pursue Select Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances  We continually evaluate opportunities to supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances, or acquiring businesses or technologies, that we believe will enable us to enter new markets, provide new client segments, new products or services, or otherwise expand our market share in the fixed-income markets that we operate in today. We believe that one of the key drivers of our success to date has been the ability to grow our current product offering. For example, in 2020, we acquired the regulatory reporting business of Deutsche B\u00f6rse (\u201cRegulatory Reporting Hub\u201d) in order to expand the footprint of our post-trade and market data services by adding approximately 500 clients across Europe. In 2021, we acquired MuniBrokers, a central electronic venue serving municipal bond inter-dealer brokers and dealers, in order to expand our existing municipal bond trading solution. In 2022, we made a significant minority investment in RFQ-hub, a bilateral multi-asset and multi-dealer RFQ platform. We also entered into a strategic collaboration on liquid fixed-income indexes, portfolio construction solutions and environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) data with MSCI Inc. We expect these transactions to accelerate the growth of our ETF and index businesses. The Fixed-Income Products Available on our Platform  We operate in a large and rapidly growing market, which consists of credit and rates fixed-income products. According to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (\u201cSIFMA\u201d), as of September 30, 2022, the most recent date available, there were approximately $10.1 trillion in principal amount of fixed-income securities outstanding in the U.S. corporate market, which reflects a five-year compound annual growth rate of 4.0%. In addition, according to SIFMA, as of December 31, 2022, there were approximately $23.9 trillion in principal amount of fixed-income securities outstanding in the U.S. government bond market, which reflects a five-year compound annual growth rate of 10.6%. During the first nine months of 2022, global long-term new bond issuance aggregated to approximately $1.4 trillion, a decrease of 31.0% as compared to the same period of 2021. Our proprietary technology allows institutional investor and broker-dealer clients to access this market by trading both credit and rates products on our platforms.  Our credit products consist of the following areas:  \u2022U.S. high-grade bonds, which refers to U.S. corporate debt rated BBB- or better by Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d) or Baa3 or better by Moody\u2019s Investor Service (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d);  U.S. high-grade bonds, which refers to U.S. corporate debt rated BBB- or better by Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d) or Baa3 or better by Moody\u2019s Investor Service (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d);  \u2022U.S. high-yield bonds, which refers to U.S. corporate debt rated lower than BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody\u2019s;  U.S. high-yield bonds, which refers to U.S. corporate debt rated lower than BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody\u2019s;  \u2022Emerging market debt, which we define as U.S. dollar, Euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country, typically located in Latin America, Asia, or Central and Eastern Europe;  Emerging market debt, which we define as U.S. dollar, Euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country, typically located in Latin America, Asia, or Central and Eastern Europe;  \u2022Eurobonds, which we define generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to European investors, primarily bonds issued by European corporations, excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in Europe;  Eurobonds, which we define generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to European investors, primarily bonds issued by European corporations, excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in Europe;  \u2022Municipal bonds, which are debt securities issued by states, cities, counties and other governmental entities in the U.S. to fund day-to-day obligations and to finance a wide variety of public projects, such as highways or water systems, and typically offer interest payments that are exempt from federal income taxation and may be exempt from state income and other taxes; and Municipal bonds, which are debt securities issued by states, cities, counties and other governmental entities in the U.S. to fund day-to-day obligations and to finance a wide variety of public projects, such as highways or water systems, and typically offer interest payments that are exempt from federal income taxation and may be exempt from state income and other taxes; and \u2022Other credit products, including leveraged loans, which are senior secured commercial facilities provided by a syndicate of lenders for below investment-grade companies (credit rating below BBB- or Baa3).

European countries, as well as bonds issued by other supranational organizations, agencies and sovereigns, including the European Commission. \u00a0 7 \u00a0 The six largest product areas available on our platform for the year ended December 31, 2022 were U.S. high-grade, U.S. high-yield, emerging market debt, Eurobonds, municipal bonds and U.S. government bonds. In the chart below, we show the average daily trading volume and the amount of new issuance of such product areas for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, except where indicated: \u00a0 Average Daily Trading Volume \u00a0 Amount of New Issuance \u00a0 2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 2021 \u00a0 \u00a0 % Change \u00a0 2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 2021 \u00a0 \u00a0 % Change \u00a0 (In billions) U.S. high-grade(1) $ 25.7 \u00a0 \u00a0 $ 23.6 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 8.9 \u00a0 % \u00a0 $ 1,215.7 \u00a0 \u00a0 $ 1,379.9 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (11.9 ) % U.S. high-yield(1) \u00a0 9.5 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 9.8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (3.1 ) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 106.5 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 483.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (78.0 ) \u00a0 Emerging market debt(2) \u00a0 20.8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 20.4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 219.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 541.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (59.5 ) \u00a0 Eurobonds(3) \u00a0 9.4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 11.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (14.5 ) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 460.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 487.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (5.5 ) \u00a0 Municipal bonds(4) \u00a0 8.4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4.4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 90.9 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 386.6 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 481.9 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (19.8 ) \u00a0 U.S. government bonds(5) \u00a0 614.3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 624.1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (1.6 ) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 16,730.9 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 19,511.8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (14.3 ) \u00a0 \u00a0 (1) For U.S. high-grade and high-yield, average daily trading volume (\u201cADTV\u201d) is as measured by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (\u201cTRACE\u201d) and amount of new issuance is according to J.P. Morgan Markets. (2) For emerging markets debt, ADTV is as measured by the Emerging Markets Trade Association and amount of new issuance is according to J.P. Morgan Markets. The amount of new issuance excludes debt issued by emerging market sovereigns, which are included in our definition of emerging markets debt. ADTV is for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the most recent dates available. (3) For Eurobonds, ADTV is according to our internal estimates and amount of new issuance is according to J.P. Morgan Markets. (4) For municipal bonds, ADTV is as measured by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the \u201cMSRB\u201d) and amount of new issuance is according to SIFMA. (5) For U.S. government bonds, ADTV and the amount of new issuance is according to SIFMA. We believe that the current level of electronic trading in our six largest product areas is generally low, creating a long runway for future market share growth. For example, we estimate that the level of electronic trading as a percentage of all means of trading (referred to as \u201celectronic market share\u201d) for U.S. high-grade bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds, municipal bonds, emerging market debt and Eurobonds are approximately 40%, 30%, 15%, 10% and 55%, respectively. U.S. government bonds are further down the path of electronic trading with an estimated electronic market share at approximately 65%. As a comparison, based on third party estimates, the level of electronic market share for U.S. equity options, U.S. Exchange traded cash equities and foreign exchange spots are each over 90%. We plan to leverage our Open Trading functionality to continue to capture additional market share across our core credit markets while increasing our footprint in newer product areas. In the chart below, we show our estimated market share for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, of Composite Corporate Bonds, U.S. high-grade bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds, emerging market debt, Eurobonds, municipal bonds and U.S. government bonds. \u00a0 Estimated Market Share \u00a0 2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 2021 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bps Change Composite Corporate Bond(1) \u00a0 19.9 \u00a0 % \u00a0 18.1 \u00a0 % \u00a0 180 \u00a0 Bps U.S. high-grade \u00a0 21.3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 21.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 30 \u00a0 \u00a0 U.S. high-yield \u00a0 17.9 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 15.2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 270 \u00a0 \u00a0 Emerging market debt(2) \u00a0 29.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 26.8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 220 \u00a0 \u00a0 Eurobonds \u00a0 15.4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 12.1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 330 \u00a0 \u00a0 Municipal bonds \u00a0 4.5 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 240 \u00a0 \u00a0 U.S. government bonds \u00a0 3.5 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.6 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 90 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (1) Composite corporate bond estimated market share is defined as combined estimated market share across U.S. high-grade (derived from FINRA TRACE reported data), U.S. high-yield (derived from FINRA TRACE reported data), emerging markets (derived from FINRA TRACE-reportable emerging markets volume, principally U.S. dollar denominated corporates) and Eurobonds (derived from MarketAxess TRAX data which is currently estimated to represent approximately 70% of the total European market) product areas. (2) Emerging markets estimated market share is calculated using FINRA TRACE-reportable emerging markets trading volume, principally U.S. dollar denominated corporates. \u00a0 8 \u00a0 Our Full Trading Lifecycle Solutions A key principle of our strategy is connecting the most robust network of participants through our full trading lifecycle solution. The diverse trading protocols available on our platforms are complemented by pre-trade intelligent data products and a range of post-trade services. In 2022, 89.3% of our revenues were derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms, 5.5% of our revenues were derived from our data products and 5.1% of our revenues were derived from our post-trade services. Diverse Trading Protocols  Disclosed Request for Quote  Our traditional disclosed RFQ protocol allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing, executable bids or offers from our dealer clients and execute trades with the dealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond. We are not a counterparty to any of the disclosed RFQ trades that are executed on our platforms between institutional investor clients and dealer clients; rather, our platforms enable them to meet, agree on a price and then execute and settle the transaction directly with each other. The disclosed RFQ protocol is available for transactions in all our product areas and can be used for: \u2022multiple-dealer inquiries to over 140 dealers; multiple-dealer inquiries to over 140 dealers; \u2022list trading, which is the ability to request bids and offers on up to 60 bonds at the same time;  list trading, which is the ability to request bids and offers on up to 60 bonds at the same time;  \u2022portfolio trading, which allows our market participants to transact bond basket trades of up to 2,100 securities in an all-or-none trading protocol with one aggregate price for the portfolio transaction; and portfolio trading, which allows our market participants to transact bond basket trades of up to 2,100 securities in an all-or-none trading protocol with one aggregate price for the portfolio transaction; and \u2022swap trading, which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond. swap trading, which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond. In 2022, over 60.0% of all credit volume on the MarketAxess platform was executed via a form of our disclosed RFQ protocol.  Open Trading  We offer Open Trading, our all-to-all trading solution, for most of our products and trading protocols. Open Trading complements our disclosed RFQ protocol by increasing the number of potential counterparties through allowing all participants to interact anonymously in an all-to-all trading environment of over 1,700 potential counterparties. We believe the increased liquidity drives meaningful price improvement to our clients and helps reduce liquidity risk in the fixed-income markets in which we participate. Open Trading participants are able to maintain their anonymity from trade initiation all the way through to settlement. Unlike our disclosed RFQ protocol, in connection with our Open Trading protocols, we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching back-to-back trades. We currently offer Open Trading protocols in U.S. high-grade bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds, Eurobonds, certain emerging market debt, municipal bonds, U.S. government bonds, agency bonds and other government bonds. Following the introduction of Open Trading on our platforms in 2013, we have continued to build upon the technology to develop more features and services. We now offer several Open Trading protocols, including:  \u2022Open Trading RFQ, which provides our Open Trading participants with the ability to display requests for bids and offers anonymously to the entire MarketAxess trading community, thereby creating broad visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increasing the likelihood that the request will result in a completed trade. The Open Trading RFQ protocol is typically used simultaneously with a disclosed RFQ, providing the requestor with an increased likelihood of achieving best execution by seeking pricing from a participant\u2019s known dealer trading relationships and the Open Trading marketplace at the same time; Open Trading RFQ, which provides our Open Trading participants with the ability to display requests for bids and offers anonymously to the entire MarketAxess trading community, thereby creating broad visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increasing the likelihood that the request will result in a completed trade. The Open Trading RFQ protocol is typically used simultaneously with a disclosed RFQ, providing the requestor with an increased likelihood of achieving best execution by seeking pricing from a participant\u2019s known dealer trading relationships and the Open Trading marketplace at the same time; \u2022Dealer RFQ, which allows dealers to initiate RFQs to all other dealers or to the entire Open Trading network, is used by our dealer clients to manage risk, source liquidity, and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients; Dealer RFQ, which allows dealers to initiate RFQs to all other dealers or to the entire Open Trading network, is used by our dealer clients to manage risk, source liquidity, and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients; \u2022Mid-X sessions, a sessions-based mid-point matching tool that allows broker-dealers to trade against the mid-point price established by Composite+ at a given time instead of bilaterally negotiating a price, which we believe removes some of the pricing challenges inherent in other trading protocols; Mid-X sessions, a sessions-based mid-point matching tool that allows broker-dealers to trade against the mid-point price established by Composite+ at a given time instead of bilaterally negotiating a price, which we believe removes some of the pricing challenges inherent in other trading protocols; \u2022Live Markets, an order book functionality that creates a single view of two-way, actionable prices for the most active corporate bonds and U.S. government bonds, including newly issued debt, benchmark issues and news-driven securities;  Live Markets, an order book functionality that creates a single view of two-way, actionable prices for the most active corporate bonds and U.S. government bonds, including newly issued debt, benchmark issues and news-driven securities;  \u2022Public Axes\u0099, which is an order book-style price discovery process that gives participants the ability to view and execute trades upon anonymous or disclosed indications of interest from the inventory posted on our platforms; and  Public Axes\u0099, which is an order book-style price discovery process that gives participants the ability to view and execute trades upon anonymous or disclosed indications of interest from the inventory posted on our platforms; and  \u2022Diversity Dealer Initiative, which leverages the liquidity-enhancing features of Open Trading, but also allows institutional investor clients to select minority-, women- and veteran-owned broker-dealers to intermediate the resulting Open Trading transaction. Diversity Dealer Initiative, which leverages the liquidity-enhancing features of Open Trading, but also allows institutional investor clients to select minority-, women- and veteran-owned broker-dealers to intermediate the resulting Open Trading transaction. In 2022, approximately 35.9% of all eligible credit volume on the MarketAxess platform was executed via Open Trading protocols. 9 \u00a0 Automated Trading Protocols  We believe that our automated trading protocols, which allow clients to set eligibility criteria for their orders that our platforms will use to determine whether or not to execute a trade in accordance with the pre-defined parameters, increase trading efficiency and allow traders to focus on higher-value trades. We expect that bond trading velocity will grow in the years ahead due to the increased adoption of trading automation by both broker-dealer and institutional investor participants.  We support a large and growing base of dealer market making algorithms. Dealer market making algorithms enhance the liquidity available on our platforms by increasing the number of competitive responses to each RFQ, thereby increasing a participant\u2019s likelihood of completing a trade at the best price. In 2022, there were 23.7 million dealer algorithmic responses on our platforms, up 29.2% from 2021. In addition, dealers are increasingly using algorithmic responses to execute larger trades. In 2022, 57.0% of client-to-dealer inquiries for a trade of greater than $5.0 million notional value in U.S. high grade bonds received one or more algorithmic responses, up from 6.6% in 2017. In addition, some of our automation tools include:  \u2022Auto-X RFQ, which allows clients to automatically execute a request-for-quote using simple variables such as trade size, price and number of respondents. In 2022, Auto-X RFQ represented 18.2% of total trade count and 7.2% of our credit trading volume. 33.0% of Auto-X RFQ trades in 2022 were \u201cno touch,\u201d meaning such trades were initiated automatically by clients using pre-specified instructions, up from 20.4% in 2021;  Auto-X RFQ, which allows clients to automatically execute a request-for-quote using simple variables such as trade size, price and number of respondents. In 2022, Auto-X RFQ represented 18.2% of total trade count and 7.2% of our credit trading volume. 33.0% of Auto-X RFQ trades in 2022 were \u201cno touch,\u201d meaning such trades were initiated automatically by clients using pre-specified instructions, up from 20.4% in 2021;  \u2022Auto-Responder, which allows clients to automatically respond to requests using either a specified response level or a mid-point price generated by one of our data products; and  Auto-Responder, which allows clients to automatically respond to requests using either a specified response level or a mid-point price generated by one of our data products; and  \u2022U.S. Treasury Hedging, which automatically provides a U.S. Treasury hedge for trades in credit products available on our platforms. U.S. Treasury Hedging, which automatically provides a U.S. Treasury hedge for trades in credit products available on our platforms. In 2022, there were 162 client firms using our automation trading protocols, up 15.7% from 2021.  Order and Execution Workflow Solutions  We provide order and execution workflow solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients. For example, LiquidityBridge\u00ae, is our execution management system offered to dealers that allows users to manage and facilitate the complex liquidity flows across multiple trading platforms, including the MarketAxess system. LiquidityBridge brings together real-time comparison and execution of bond prices across multiple sectors, allowing users to rapidly react to trading opportunities. In addition, Axess IQ\u0099 is our order and execution workflow solution designed to meet the needs of the wealth management and private banking community by improving liquidity discovery, execution efficiency and alpha generation for firms with large numbers of individual client orders.  Integrated and Actionable Data Timely and accurate data is particularly important in the fixed-income markets where real-time data has traditionally been scarce and transparency has been limited. We offer the following data products and index solutions: Data Products  Traders are increasingly using data and machine-learning for pre-trade analytics, automated execution, transaction cost analysis and post-trade solutions. Our data strategy is centered on using our data offerings to support trading activity through our diverse trading protocols and growing our revenues from our commercial data offerings. We believe that our electronic trading platforms allow institutional investors to compile, sort and use information to discover investment opportunities that might have been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual information-gathering process or other electronic services. Our data products are based on the trading activity, completed transactions and trade reporting services that occur on or through our platforms, as well as public sources such as TRACE. 10 \u00a0 Our data products include:  \u2022Composite+, a pricing algorithm generates near real-time prices for approximately 33,000 corporate and sovereign bonds based on a variety of data inputs, including feeds from our trading platforms, our post-trade services and TRACE. Composite+ is used by clients as a pre-trade reference price to enhance trading outcomes and transaction cost analysis. Composite+ can be combined with our auto-execution service, providing clients with an alert if a response is \u201coff market.\u201d  Composite+, a pricing algorithm generates near real-time prices for approximately 33,000 corporate and sovereign bonds based on a variety of data inputs, including feeds from our trading platforms, our post-trade services and TRACE.

Relative Liquidity Score, a product that provides a defined measurement of the current liquidity for individual bonds and highlights the relative potential ease that a trader can expect when transacting in such instruments. Index Solutions  To meet the increasing need for passive fixed-income investment strategies, we have also introduced liquid indices powered by real-time data. In 2022, we introduced the MarketAxess U.S. Investment Grade Corporate Bond 400 Index (the \u201cMKTX 400 Index\u201d), which is an index constructed to measure the performance of 400 U.S. dollar denominated investment grade corporate bonds with higher-than-average liquidity relative to the broader U.S. corporate bond market. The index utilizes Relative Liquidity Scores and Composite+ in the construction and evaluation processes. State Street Global Advisors has launched an exchange traded fund that seeks to track the MKTX 400 Index. In addition, in 2022, we also announced a strategic collaboration with MSCI Inc. to create co-branded fixed-income indices incorporating our liquidity data. The first of such indices, the MSCI MarketAxess USD HY Tradable Corporate Bond Index, which uses Relative Liquidity Scores to identify and select the liquid fixed-income securities, launched in November 2022. Post-Trade Services We provide trade matching and regulatory reporting services for European investment firms and market and reference data across a range of fixed-income products. In response to the requirements of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (\u201cMiFID II\u201d) in Europe, we have developed a comprehensive suite of value-add solutions, including SensAI, pre-trade transparency services, systematic internaliser (\u201cSI\u201d) determination and monitoring, best execution reporting, commodity position reporting, data quality analysis and peer benchmarking. In the E.U. and United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), all firms regulated as \u201cinvestment firms\u201d under MiFID II are required to submit complete and accurate details of qualifying transactions to their national regulator no later than the close of the working day following the date of the transaction. This process is known as transaction reporting. Firms may either report directly to their regulator or use an entity that is licensed as an Approved Reporting Mechanism (\u201cARM\u201d), such as our subsidiaries in the U.K. and the Netherlands, to validate and submit such reports to their regulator. Our multi-asset class ARM reporting solution allows our clients to report to 23 different European regulators. We have also collaborated with Equilend on a full front-to-back Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (\u201cSFTR\u201d) solution to support mutual clients with their SFTR reporting requirements. Under the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (\u201cMiFIR\u201d), all regulated investment firms in the U.K. and the E.U. are required to comply with pre- and post-trade transparency requirements pursuant to which quotes and trades must be made public subject to a system of waivers and deferrals. Firms are required to utilize an Approved Publication Arrangement (\u201cAPA\u201d), such as our APAs in the U.K. and the Netherlands, to comply with the post-trade transparency requirement and many firms utilize a third-party provider to satisfy the pre-trade transparency requirement. The MarketAxess transparency and APA trade reporting solutions are available through our Insight\u0099 platform, offering our clients a pre- and post-trade transparency solution, including APA trade reporting, quote publication, SI determination and instrument liquidity classification. We also offer a commodity position reporting service to assist firms in compliance with the commodity derivative position limit reporting requirements of MiFID II. Trade matching enables counterparties to agree on the terms of a trade shortly after execution, reducing the risk of trade errors and fails during settlement. We provide a near real-time post-trade matching and exception management tool which covers a broad range of securities, including fixed-income and equities. By confirming all economic details within minutes of trade execution, we help our clients to mitigate their operational risk, improve STP and efficiency and address the complexities of MiFID II and the Central Securities Depositories Regulation.  MarketAxess has approximately 980 post-trade reporting, post-trade matching and transparency clients, including investment firms, venues and aggregators. In 2020, we acquired Regulatory Reporting Hub, which has helped us expand and improve our services across a broader European client base, predominantly in Germany, France and the Nordics regions. 11 \u00a0 Our Clients  Over 2,000 institutional investor and broker-dealer firms are active users of our platforms. Although institutional investors, specialist market-making firms, proprietary trading firms and other non-traditional liquidity providers have increasingly provided liquidity on our platforms through Open Trading, we believe traditional broker-dealers still represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the markets in which we operate. Secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume following the original issuance of the security, without substantially affecting the price of the security. Our Technology  Proprietary Technology  Our electronic trading platforms are based on a secure and scalable architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed and reliability. Our technology supports the full trading lifecycle and provides clients with end-to-end and customizable connectivity to fixed-income markets.  We support the achievement of best execution through technologies such as our all-to-all Open Trading protocols, which increase the number of potential trading counterparties by allowing participants to interact anonymously in an all-to-all trading environment of over 1,700 potential counterparties. We believe this technology enhances our institutional investor clients\u2019 ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all Open Trading participants to interact with each other and increases the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response. We estimate that Open Trading generated approximately $945.3 million of price improvement for our clients in 2022.  In addition, our clients have access to automated trading technologies, such as Auto-X RFQ and Auto-Responder, which allow clients to set eligibility criteria for their orders that will determine whether a trade is executed on our platforms in accordance with their pre-defined parameters. These automated trading protocols are designed to help increase trading efficiency, freeing traders to focus on more complex or higher-value trades.  In addition to services directly related to the execution of trades, MarketAxess offers clients several other pre- and post-trade services. In the pre-trade period, our platforms assist our participants by providing them with value-added services, such as real-time and historical trade price information, liquidity and turnover analytics, bond reference data and trade order matching alerts. Following the execution of a trade, our platforms enable our participants to realize the full benefits of electronic trading and demonstrate best execution, including customization, real-time trade details, STP, account allocations, automated audit trails, regulatory trade reporting, trade detail matching and transaction cost analysis. Technology Team  The design and quality of our technology products is supported by a team of approximately 300 full-time technology professionals led by managers with deep market knowledge and fixed-income expertise. This combination of market knowledge and industry expertise allows us to address client demand and to focus on solutions that can be scaled across client sectors, fixed-income classes and trading protocols. Our technology is critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy. Our technology team is focused on: \u2022Continuing to evolve our technology platform. We believe that it is imperative that we continue to invest in and evolve our technology in order to continue innovating and delivering new features and protocols to our clients. For example, we increasingly utilize cloud technology to capitalize on innovative tooling, cost savings and improvements to development velocity.  Continuing to evolve our technology platform.

For example, we increasingly utilize cloud technology to capitalize on innovative tooling, cost savings and improvements to development velocity.  \u2022Investing in resiliency, scale and risk management. We recognize the value of investing in our capacity and risk management capabilities. The MarketAxess platforms are built on industry-standard technologies and have been designed to handle loads that exceed our current trading volume. In addition, all critical server-side components, including networks, application servers and databases, have backup solutions if the main equipment fails. This offers redundant system capacity designed to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure. We also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure. Most of our broker-dealer clients and a significant number of our institutional investor clients have redundant dedicated high-speed communication paths to our network to provide fast data transfer. Our security measures include industry-standard communications encryption.  Investing in resiliency, scale and risk management.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we delivered approximately 710 unique new business and technical features to our clients. 12 \u00a0 Data Security As a global technology company, and a marketplace for fixed-income securities, we view information security as fundamental to our business. Accordingly, we are committed to appropriately securing all of our business operations, including information that we generate in the performance of our services, and data provided to us by third parties.  We prioritize security throughout our platforms, operations and software development. We use architectural, design and implementation features to structurally address security risks, such as logical and physical access controls, perimeter firewall protection and embedded security processes in our systems development lifecycle. Our cybersecurity program is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework (the \u201cFramework\u201d) and we are ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified, which is a global standard that specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving information security management systems. The Framework consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risks and promote the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure. Our Global Chief Information Security Officer, who reports directly to our Chief Information Officer and Chief Risk Officer, leads a cybersecurity team in assessing, managing and reducing the relevant risks with a goal of assuring continuous delivery of service. We constantly monitor connectivity and suspect events are escalated to our global risk and management teams.  The information security team guides our response during information security incidents. The Company\u2019s goal is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible following an event, provide timely and accurate information to relevant stakeholders regarding such an event and minimize the impact of such an event on our business operations. In addition to the information security team, we have assembled a group of senior members of management and third-party consultants ready to react to an event, should one ever occur.  See Part I, Item 1A. \u2013 \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Technology, IT Systems and Cybersecurity Risks.\u201d Environmental, Social and Governance We are focused on growing our business by delivering sustainable long-term value for our customers, employees, stockholders, and the communities where we live and work. At MarketAxess, our ESG strategy encompasses both corporate and commercial objectives.  Corporate ESG Objectives  As part of our vision to maximize stakeholder value, we strive to incorporate ESG principles into our business strategies and organizational culture. Our 2021 ESG Report, which can be found on our corporate website (available at https://www.marketaxess.com/sustainability), included the results of the Company's first comprehensive non-financial ESG materiality and prioritization assessment, which identified eighteen key ESG topics and six priority topics critical for MarketAxess to manage and drive long-term business performance and societal impact. In addition, in response to the increasing importance of climate change to the overall global economy and its effect on global credit markets, we responded to the Climate Disclosure Project's Climate Change Questionnaire in July 2022. Please also refer to \u201c\u2014 Human Capital Resources\u201d for additional information on our human capital management strategies. Our ESG Reports and CDP questionnaire responses are not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Form 10-K or incorporated into any of our other filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Commercial ESG Objectives  In order to help our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients meet their ESG goals and strategies, we have begun to develop ESG-integrated product offerings. For example, in 2019, we launched our \u201cTrading for Trees\u201d program, under which five trees are planted by One Tree Planted, our partner charitable organization, for every $1.0 million of green bond trades executed on our platforms. In 2022, $63.3 billion in corporate and municipal green bond trading volume was executed globally on our platforms, an increase of 24.0% from 2021. In the U.S., where public data is available, MarketAxess ranks as the largest electronic corporate and municipal green bond marketplace with an estimated market share of 21.4% in TRACE-reported corporate and municipal green bond volume.  In addition, in 2021, we launched the Diversity Dealer Initiative to enable buy side firms to trade more easily with certain minority-, women- and veteran-owned broker-dealers, while still achieving best execution. The Diversity Dealer Initiative leverages our anonymous all-to-all Open Trading marketplace and provides enhanced trading connections by giving institutional investor clients the option to select a diversity dealer to intermediate an Open Trading transaction. 13 \u00a0 Sales and Marketing  We promote our products and services using a variety of direct and indirect sales and marketing strategies. Our sales force, which works closely with our product management and technology teams, is responsible for client acquisition activity and the management of ongoing client relationships. Our sales team is also responsible for training and supporting new and existing clients on their use of our platforms and post-trade solutions, including how to optimize their trading performance and efficiency through our various trading protocols. We employ various strategies, including advertising, direct marketing, digital and social media, promotional mailings, and participation in industry conferences and media engagement, to increase awareness of our brand, our trading platforms and our other solutions. For example, we work with The Wall Street Journal to leverage BondTicker data as the source of information for its weekly distressed debt tables.  Seasonality  Our revenue can be impacted by seasonal effects caused by increased levels of new bond issuance, which often occurs in the first quarter of a year, or slow-downs in trading activity, particularly during the customary holiday periods in August and December. Competition  The global fixed-income securities industry generally, and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. We compete with a broad range of market participants globally. Some of these market participants compete with us in a particular market, while select others compete against the entire spectrum of our platforms and solutions. We believe our competitive position is enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our clients with our electronic trading platforms and other systems. We primarily compete on the basis of our client network, the liquidity provided by our broker-dealer clients, the unique liquidity and the potential for price improvement offered by our Open Trading protocols, the total transaction costs associated with our services, the breadth of products, protocols and services offered, as well as the quality, reliability, security and ease of use of our platforms. We face the following main areas of competition:  \u2022Bilateral Trading \u2014 We compete with bond trading business conducted over the telephone, e-mail or instant messaging directly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients. Institutional investors have historically purchased fixed-income securities by telephoning or otherwise communicating via e-mail or instant messaging with bond sales professionals at one or more broker-dealers and inquiring about the price and availability of individual bonds. This remains the manner in which the majority of corporate bond volumes are still traded between institutional investors and broker-dealers.

We compete with Tradeweb, Bloomberg, Intercontinental Exchange, Trumid and others in the credit and municipal markets; and Tradeweb, Bloomberg, CME Group (BrokerTec), BGC Partners (Fenics UST) and others in the rates markets. In addition, some broker-dealers and institutional investors operate, or have invested in, proprietary electronic trading systems or information networks that enable institutional investors to trade directly with a broker-dealer, and/or with other institutional investors over an electronic medium. As we expand our business into new products, we will likely come into more direct competition with other electronic trading platforms or firms offering traditional services.

For example, the London Stock Exchange Group acquired a significant stake in Tradeweb and Intercontinental Exchange acquired BondPoint and TMC Bonds, retail-focused platforms, and IDC, a provider of fixed-income data, in an effort to expand its portfolio of fixed-income products and services. CME Group also operates platforms that compete with us. Exchanges also have data and analytics businesses, which increasingly put their offerings in direct competition with us.

Some of these entities currently offer varying forms of electronic trading of fixed-income securities. Some of these entities have announced their intention to expand their electronic trading platforms or to develop new platforms. These entities are currently direct competitors to our information services business and already are or may in the future become direct competitors to our electronic trading platforms.

Other approved regulatory reporting businesses \u2014 We compete with other approved regulatory mechanisms in Europe that have ARM and APA designations, such as the London Stock Exchange\u2019s UnaVista and Tradeweb, to provide post-trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting and transparency services to European clients. 14 \u00a0 We face intense competition, and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. See Part I, Item 1A. \u2013 \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to Operating in the Electronic Fixed-Income Trading Markets \u2014 We face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\u201d Intellectual Property  We rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. Our software code, elements of our electronic trading platforms, website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws. We have been issued 13 patents covering significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology.  The written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology, processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets. Examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements, employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements, and agreements with customers, contractors and strategic partners. Other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology, processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret rights.  We have registered the MarketAxess\u00ae name and logo for trademark in the U.S., Europe and in other parts of the world. We also have a number of other registered or pending trademarks and service marks globally, including Open Trading\u00ae, BondTicker\u00ae, Composite+\u0099, Axess All\u00ae and Now You\u2019re In The Market\u00ae among others. In addition, we own, or have filed applications for, the rights to trade names, copyrights, domain names and service marks that we use in the marketing of products and services to clients. In addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product and service developments, frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position. Government Regulation  The securities industry and financial markets in the U.S. and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation. In these jurisdictions, government regulators and self-regulatory organizations oversee the conduct of our business, and have broad powers to promulgate and interpret laws, rules and regulations that may serve to restrict or limit our business. As a matter of public policy, these regulators are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets. Our active broker-dealer and regulated venue subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations. Rulemaking by regulators, including resulting market structure changes, has had an impact on our business by directly affecting our method of operation and, at times, our profitability.  As registered broker-dealers, trading venues and other types of regulated entities as described below, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules and regulations (including the rules of self-regulatory organizations) that cover all aspects of their business, including manner of operation, system integrity, anti-money laundering and financial crimes, handling of material non-public information, safeguarding data, capital requirements, reporting, record retention, market access, licensing of employees and the conduct of officers, employees and other associated persons. Regulation can impose, and has imposed, obligations on our regulated subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiary. These increased obligations require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls, which have increased our costs. Many of our regulators, as well as other governmental authorities, are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings, examinations, inspections and investigations, which may result in increased compliance costs, penalties, fines, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements, additional restrictions or limitations, censure, suspension or disqualification of the entity and/or its officers, employees or other associated persons, or other sanctions, such as disgorgement, restitution or the revocation or limitation of regulatory approvals. Whether or not resulting in adverse findings, regulatory proceedings, examinations, inspections and investigations can require substantial expenditures of time and money and can have an adverse impact on a firm\u2019s reputation, client relationships and profitability. From time to time, we and our associated persons have been and are subject to routine reviews, none of which to date have had a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. As a result of such reviews, and any future actions or reviews, we may be required to, among other things, amend certain internal structures and frameworks such as our operating procedures, systems and controls. 15 \u00a0 The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to constant change. We are unable to predict how certain new laws and proposed rules and regulations will be implemented or in what form, or whether any changes to existing laws, rules and regulations, including the interpretation, implementation or enforcement thereof or a relaxation or amendment thereof, will occur in the future. We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of certain new rules and regulations may negatively impact our clients and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact, although a relaxation of or the amendment of existing rules and requirements could potentially have a positive impact in certain markets. For example, regulators are speaking more regularly about the benefits of all-to-all trading to promote market resiliency in fixed-income products. While we generally believe the net impact of the laws, rules and regulations may be positive for our business, it is possible that unintended consequences may materially adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. See Part I, Item 1A. \u2013 \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Regulatory and Legal Risks - Our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation, which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business.\u201d U.S. Regulation In the U.S., the SEC is the federal governmental agency primarily responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws, including adopting and enforcing rules and regulations applicable to broker-dealers. Our broker-dealer subsidiary operates an alternative trading system (\u201cATS\u201d) subject to the SEC\u2019s Regulation ATS, which includes certain specific requirements and compliance responsibilities in addition to those faced by broker-dealers generally, and an exempt ATS for U.S. government bonds. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have registered to do business. We are also subject to the various anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Commodity Exchange Act, certain state securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. We also may be subject to vicarious and controlling person liability for the activities of our subsidiaries and our officers, employees and affiliated persons.  Much of the regulation of broker-dealers\u2019 operations in the United States has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are generally subject to approval by the SEC) that govern the operations of broker-dealers and conduct periodic inspections and examinations of their operations. In the case of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, the principal self-regulatory organization is FINRA. Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the SEC and FINRA. In addition, our broker-dealer\u2019s municipal securities-related activities are subject to the rules of the MSRB. The SEC recently conducted a review of the regulatory framework for fixed-income electronic trading platforms for the purpose of evaluating the potential regulatory gaps that may exist among such platforms, including ours, with respect to access to markets, system integrity, surveillance, and transparency, among other things. In January 2022, as a result of this review, the SEC proposed rules that will expand Regulation ATS and Regulation SCI to alternative trading systems (ATS) that trade government securities and amend the SEC rule regarding the definition of an \u201cexchange\u201d to include Communication Protocol Systems, such as our RFQ protocols. In connection with these proposed rules, we expect that we will have to operate all of our trading protocols in compliance with Regulation ATS. The fixed-income industry is also in the process of complying with Rule 15c2-11 (\u201cPublication or submission of quotations without specified information\u201d) of the Exchange Act, which had not previously been applied to debt securities. In November 2022, the SEC issued a no-action letter that delayed the full implementation of Rule 15c2-11 until 2025. It is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or whether pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified, or what effect such passage, adoption or modification will have, whether positive or negative, on our industry, our clients or us. Non-U.S. Regulation Outside of the United States, we are currently directly regulated by: the Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) in the U.K., De Nederlandsche Bank (\u201cDNB\u201d) and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (\u201cAFM\u201d) in the Netherlands, the European Securities and Markets Authority (\u201cESMA\u201d) in the E.U., the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the \u201cMAS\u201d), the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (the \u201cIIROC\u201d) and provincial regulators in Canada, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and Central Bank in Brazil. We also hold cross-border licenses or permissions to operate in other jurisdictions with other regulatory bodies, including the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (\u201cFINMA\u201d), the Securities & Futures Commission of Hong Kong, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission in Australia (\u201cASIC\u201d), the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (\u201cBaFin\u201d), the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier of Luxembourg, the Italian Commissione Nazionale per le Societ\u00e0 e la Borsa (\u201cConsob\u201d), the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority and the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.  The FCA\u2019s strategic objective is to ensure that the relevant markets function properly and its operational objectives are to protect consumers, to protect and enhance the integrity of the U.K. financial system and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers. It has investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\u201cFSMA\u201d) and subsequent legislation and regulations. Subject to the FSMA, individuals or companies that seek to acquire or increase their control in a firm that the FCA regulates is required to obtain prior approval from the FCA. 16 \u00a0 A draft U.K. Financial Services and Markets Bill (\u201cFSMB\u201d) was tabled to the U.K. Parliament in July 2022, which repeals the financial services framework inherited from the E.U. The FSMB offers the FCA increased regulatory authority, including the power to reform E.U. rules and the ability to devise a new financial services regime, and establishes a new secondary objective to promote \u201ceconomic growth and international competitiveness\u201d for the U.K. In December 2022, the FCA published its proposed approach and has invited feedback from industry participants. We currently expect the FSMB to become law during 2023. The securities industry and financial markets in the 27 member states of the E.U. are regulated by the National Competent Authorities in each member state, or with respect to Data Reporting Services Providers (\u201cDRSPs\u201d), such as our E.U. post-trade business, by ESMA itself. E.U. regulations provide for a cross-border \u201cpassporting regime\u201d, which allows us to provide our regulated services throughout the E.U. in reliance upon our authorization from any E.U. member state or ESMA. As a result of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the E.U. in 2020 (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), we obtained AFM authorizations for our subsidiaries in the Netherlands and we now provide regulated services to our clients within the E.U. in reliance on the cross-border services passport held by our Dutch subsidiaries. The legal framework in the Netherlands for financial undertakings is predominantly included in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (\u201cFSA\u201d). The AFM, like DNB, is an autonomous administrative authority with independent responsibility for fulfilling its supervisory function. Pursuant to the FSA, the AFM authorizes investment firms. The AFM is legally responsible for business supervision. DNB is responsible for prudential supervision. The purpose of prudential supervision is to ensure the solidity of financial undertakings and to contribute to the stability of the financial sector. Holders of a qualifying holding (in short, shareholdings or voting rights of 10% or more) must apply to the DNB for a declaration of no objection and satisfy the applicable requirements of the FSA. In January 2018, the E.U. implemented enhanced rules and regulations targeted at the financial services industry, including MiFID II and MiFIR. MiFID II and MiFIR introduced significant changes to the E.U. and U.K. financial markets that were designed to facilitate more efficient markets and greater transparency for participants by: (i) enhancing pre- and post-trade transparency for fixed-income instruments, (ii) increasing and enhancing post-trade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit post-trade data to ARMs, (iii) improving technology synchronization and best execution and (iv) establishing a consolidated tape for trade data. The effectiveness of the changes introduced pursuant to MiFID II and MiFIR are currently under review by the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission. The review is focused on enhancing the transparency and availability of market data, leveling the playing field between execution venues and increasing the global competitiveness of E.U. markets. As part of the MiFIR review, the European Commission has begun the process of establishing the E.U. consolidated tape for all transactions executed on E.U. trading platforms, such as our MTFs. ESMA is expected to select a single consolidated tape provider (the \u201cCTP\u201d) for bonds under its authorization and all trading venues will be obliged to share their trading data with the CTP. We currently expect the selection process for the E.U. CTP for bonds to be completed in 2024. Likewise, the U.K. is also reviewing and amending the MiFID II and MiFIR regime and we expect that such review will introduce similar changes, such as repealing pre-trade transparency for quote driven protocols, simplifying the post-trade transparency regime and introducing a consolidated tape for bonds, during the next twenty-four months.   Although MiFID II and MiFIR were intended to help improve the functioning of the E.U. single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards, Brexit has introduced additional operational complexity as the regulatory standards are diverging between the U.K. and the E.U. In general, MiFID II and MiFIR continue to cause us to expend significantly more compliance, business and technology resources, to incur additional operational costs and has created additional regulatory exposure for our trading and post-trade businesses. While we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations, and the ongoing changes has been positive for our businesses, unintended consequences of the rules and regulations (or ongoing amendments thereto) may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. In particular, the divergence of the U.K. from the E.U. following Brexit in relation to the future development of MIFID II and MiFIR and other rules and regulations within the financial markets (such as the Central Securities Depository Regulation or the selection of a CTP) may further increase the complexity, operational costs and compliance requirements of our business in the U.K. and E.U. See Part I, Item 1A. \u2014 \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Regulatory and Legal Risks - The growing divergence of the U.K. and European Union legal and regulatory requirements following Brexit could materially adversely impact our business, clients, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\u201d Capital Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to jurisdictional specific regulatory capital requirements, designed to maintain the general financial integrity and liquidity of a regulated entity. In general, they require that at least a minimum amount of a regulated entity\u2019s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Failure to maintain required minimum capital may subject a regulated subsidiary to a fine, requirement to cease conducting business, suspension, revocation of registration or expulsion by the applicable regulatory authorities, and ultimately could require the relevant entity\u2019s liquidation.  In addition, as a result of its self-clearing activities, our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is required to finance certain transactions, maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing broker-dealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act. These requirements can fluctuate based on trading activity, market volatility or other factors which may impact our liquidity or require us to use our capital resources. 17 \u00a0 Regulatory Status of MarketAxess Entities Our operations span jurisdictions across the Americas, Europe and Asia, and we operate through various regulated entities. The current regulatory status of many of our business entities is described below. We also provide our platforms in other countries pursuant to exemptions from registration under the laws of such countries.

Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, we had 744 employees, 462 of whom were based in the U.S. and 282 of whom were based outside of the U.S., principally in the U.K. During fiscal year 2022, we increased our number of employees by 68 or 10.1% compared to an increase of 70 or 11.6%, in 2021. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.  18 \u00a0 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion We believe that a workforce that reflects our society as a whole better serves our clients. As such, we are committed to fostering an equitable environment that attracts and retains a diverse workforce. We continually strive to make our workforce more diverse, inclusive and supportive of all and the Company is committed to improving our diversity at all levels of the organization. As of December 31, 2022, (i) our global workforce was approximately 72.3% men and 27.7% women, and of our U.S. employees, our workforce was approximately 29.9% Asian, 5.2% Black or African American, 7.6% Hispanic or Latinx, 55.4% White and 1.9% identified with another race or ethnicity; (ii) our global management team was approximately 76.9% men and 23.1% women and was approximately 15.4% Asian and 84.6% White; and (iii) our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) was approximately 69.2% men and 30.8% women and was approximately 7.7% Asian, 7.7% Black or African American and 84.6% White.  We use diverse hiring sources to broaden our candidate pools, including employee referrals, recruitment vendors, postings on diversity job boards, partnering with diverse professional organizations and underrepresented student organizations, and attending various recruiting events. We also focus our diversity recruiting efforts on university campuses. We have been able to further diversify our workforce through our summer intern and graduate hire programs, which represent a spectrum of schools, fields of study, interests and socio-economic backgrounds. During the spring and fall 2022 recruiting season, we hosted MarketAxess informational sessions, coffee chats, networking events, mock interviews, hackathons, and sponsorships focused on women and underrepresented students. We also hosted two pre-identification sophomore programs that serve as an early talent pipeline for internships the following year. These two programs, one focused on women and the other on underrepresented students, are geared towards sophomores interested in the financial technology sector.  Human Capital Development Our talent management strategy is focused on attracting, developing and retaining top talent within the Company. The market for qualified staff, especially technology professionals, has become increasingly competitive in our talent markets. Many companies, including both our competitors and firms outside of our industry, are interested in hiring our experienced personnel. We believe that one of the ways we have successfully retained staff at a better rate than the market is through our hybrid work environment and remote opportunities for various technology-related positions. We are committed to positioning MarketAxess for further growth through ongoing talent management, succession planning and the deepening of our leadership bench. In 2022, we identified critical roles throughout the organization and built short- and long-term succession plans for our executive leadership team. We also evaluated the Company\u2019s formal learning and development and talent acquisition initiatives in order to ensure that our employees have the skills, capabilities and experience to effectively lead our existing, and future, global business. We believe that these plans will enable us to grow talent from within the Company. In 2022, we increased the level of investment in learning and development for all of our employees. Currently, we offer a customized management training program for new managers and an accelerated leadership program for our more seasoned leaders who we believe may assume broader or more complex roles within the Company in the future. We offer a range of live and on-demand technical, markets-related, product management and professional skills development to all employees globally to enable employees to develop a broad spectrum of skills and continue their career growth at MarketAxess.  In 2022, MarketAxess completed our second firm-wide employee engagement survey, in which 86% of our employees participated. Based on their responses, our overall employee engagement measured at 81%, which is consistent with the global averages for financial services and mid-size financial and technology companies as reported by Willis Towers Watson.  Employee Health & Wellbeing Throughout 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic (the \u201cPandemic\u201d) had less of an impact on how we manage our business than in the prior two years. Most of our employees have transitioned to a hybrid employment model with an emphasis on safety and employee wellbeing. We continue to monitor the impact of the Pandemic on our communities, including the spread of any variants, and we remain confident that we could continue to maintain business continuity and serve our clients if a return to an all-virtual environment becomes necessary to promote employee and public safety. 19 \u00a0 Company Information  MarketAxess was incorporated in Delaware in April 2000.
