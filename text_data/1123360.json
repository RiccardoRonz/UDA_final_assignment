{"cik": 1123360, "item_1A": "ITEM 1- BUSINESS  Global Payments Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to collectively as \"Global Payments,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us,\" unless the context requires otherwise.    Introduction  We are a leading payments technology company delivering innovative software and services to approximately 4.0 million merchant locations and more than 1,500 financial institutions across more than 170 countries throughout North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Our technologies, services and team member expertise allow us to provide a broad range of solutions that enable our customers to operate their businesses more efficiently across a variety of channels around the world. Headquartered in Georgia with approximately 25,000 team members worldwide, Global Payments is a Fortune 500 company and is a member of the S&P 500.\u00a0Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"GPN.\"  Industry Overview  The payments technology industry provides financial institutions, businesses and consumers with payment processing services, merchant acceptance solutions and related information and other value-added services. The industry continues to grow as a result of wider merchant acceptance and increased use of credit and debit cards, advances in payment solutions and processing technology and migration to ecommerce, omnichannel and contactless payment solutions. The proliferation of credit and debit cards, as well as other digital payment solutions, has made the acceptance of digital payments a necessity for many businesses, regardless of size, in order to remain competitive. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the use of digital payments, the need for development of technologies and digital-based solutions and the expansion of ecommerce, omnichannel and contactless payment solutions. The increased use of cards and the availability of more sophisticated technology services to all market segments has resulted in an increasingly competitive and specialized industry.   Strategy  We seek to leverage the adoption of, and transition to, card and digital-based payments by expanding our share in our existing markets through our distribution channels and service innovation, as well as through acquisitions to improve our offerings and scale. We also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures around the world. We intend to continue to invest in and leverage our technology infrastructure and our people to increase our penetration in existing markets.  The key tenets of our strategy include the following:  \u2022Leading with technology and innovation to deepen our competitive advantages;  \u2022Further scaling the four pillars of our strategy: software-driven focus, ecommerce & omnichannel solutions, exposure to faster growth markets and business-to-business (\"B2B\") payments;  \u2022Delivering commerce enablement solutions globally to broaden our leading position as a sales-driven, product-led company;  \u2022Providing frictionless, best-in-class customer experiences, creating longer-term relationships;  \u2022Nurturing our culture, values and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives to attract, retain and motivate exceptional team members; and  \u2022Supporting our communities as a socially responsible company with purpose and understanding.  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Competitive Strengths  We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:  \u2022Technology Solutions - We provide innovative technology-based solutions, including enterprise software and other ecommerce enablement solutions, that enable our customers to operate their business more efficiently, increase sales and simplify the payments process, regardless of the channel through which the transaction occurs.

Recent Business Acquisitions and Dispositions  EVO Payments, Inc.  On August 1, 2022, we entered into a merger agreement to acquire EVO Payments, Inc. (\u201cEVO\u201d) for total purchase consideration of approximately $4 billion. EVO is a leading payment technology and services provider, offering an array of payment solutions to merchants ranging from small and middle market enterprises to multinational companies and organizations across the Americas and Europe.

The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.  Consumer Business  On July 31, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the consumer portion of our Netspend business for $1\u00a0billion, subject to certain closing adjustments. The disposition further aligns our businesses with our strategy to focus on our core corporate customers, including merchants, financial institutions, software partners and technology leaders. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, subject to required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  Gaming Business  On December 6, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our gaming business for consideration of approximately $400\u00a0million, subject to certain closing adjustments.

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023 and is subject to customary terms and conditions, including any required regulatory approvals.   6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Sale of Merchant Solutions Business in Russia  As a result of economic sanctions that were imposed on individuals and entities in Russia in April 2022 that would have affected our ability to continue normal operations in Russia, we sold our Merchant Solutions business in Russia effective April 29, 2022 for cash proceeds of $9 million.  See \"Note 2\u2014Acquisitions\" and \u201cNote 3\u2014Business Dispositions\u201d in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these and other recent transactions.  Business Segments  During 2022, as a result of the pending divestiture of our consumer business and changes in how our business is managed, we realigned the businesses previously comprising our Business and Consumer Solutions segment to include the B2B portion within our Issuer Solutions segment and the consumer portion forming our new Consumer Solutions segment. Our three reportable segments now are: Merchant Solutions, Issuer Solutions and Consumer Solutions. See \"Note 17\u2014Segment Information\" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our segments, including revenues, operating income and depreciation and amortization by segment as well as financial information about geographic areas in which we operate.  Our foreign operations subject us to various risks, including, without limitation, currency exchange risks and political, economic and regulatory risks. See \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" for additional information about these risks.  Merchant Solutions Segment  Through our Merchant Solutions segment, we provide payments technology and software solutions to customers globally. Our payment technology solutions are similar around the world in that we enable our customers to accept card, check and digital-based payments. Our comprehensive offerings include, but are not limited to, authorization, settlement and funding services, customer support, chargeback resolution, terminal rental, sales and deployment, payment security services, consolidated billing and reporting.  In addition, we offer a wide array of enterprise software solutions that streamline business operations to customers in numerous vertical markets. We also provide a variety of value-added solutions and services, including specialty point-of-sale software, analytics and customer engagement, human capital management and payroll and reporting that assist our customers with driving demand and operating their businesses more efficiently.  Our value proposition is to provide distinctive high-quality, responsive and secure services to all of our customers. We distribute our Merchant Solutions services globally through multiple technology-enabled and relationship-led distribution channels and target customers in many vertical markets located throughout North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The majority of our revenues is generated by services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on the payment type or the market. We also earn software subscription and licensing fees, as well as other fees for specific value-added services, that may be unrelated to the number or value of transactions.   Distribution Channels  In the Merchant Solutions segment, we actively market and provide our payment services, enterprise software solutions and other value-added services directly to our customers through a variety of technology-enabled and relationship-led distribution channels.   Technology-Enabled. Many of our payment solutions are technology-enabled in that they incorporate or are incorporated into innovative, technology-driven solutions, including enterprise software solutions, designed to enable merchants to better manage their businesses. Our technology-enabled solutions represent a substantial component of our revenues. Our technology-enabled distribution includes integrated and vertical market software solutions and ecommerce and omnichannel solutions, each as described below.   Integrated Solutions. Our integrated solutions provide advanced payments technology that is deeply embedded into business management software solutions owned by our technology partners who operate in numerous vertical markets, primarily in North America. We grow our integrated solutions business when new or existing merchants enable payments services through enterprise software solutions sold by our partners, both new and existing.    7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents Vertical Markets Software Solutions. Our vertical markets software solutions provide advanced payments technology that is deeply integrated into business enterprise software solutions that we own. We distribute our vertical markets software solutions primarily through the following businesses:   \u2022ACTIVE Network. Through ACTIVE Network, we deliver cloud-based enterprise software, including payment technology solutions, to event organizers in the communities, government services and health and fitness markets.  \u2022AdvancedMD. Through AdvancedMD, we provide cloud-based enterprise solutions to small-to-medium sized ambulatory care physician practices in the United States.  \u2022Education Solutions. We offer integrated payment solutions specifically designed for all levels of educational institutions. For colleges and universities, we offer integrated commerce software solutions, payment services, loan services, credentialing services, open- and closed-loop payment solutions, hardware, technical support and training. For institutions serving kindergarten through 12th grade levels, we provide ecommerce and in-person payments, cafeteria POS solutions and back-office management software, hardware, technical support and training.  \u2022Gaming. We offer a comprehensive suite of solutions to the gaming market in North America. These solutions include credit and debit card cash advance, cashless advance, iGaming solutions, traditional and digital check processing and other services specific to this market. On December 6, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our gaming business, and that transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.  \u2022Xenial. Through Xenial, we offer leading-edge enterprise software and hardware solutions that integrate with our payment services and other adjacent business service applications to the restaurant and hospitality vertical markets.  \u2022Zego. Through Zego, we offer a comprehensive resident experience management software and digital commerce solutions to property managers, primarily in the United States.  Ecommerce and Omnichannel. We offer ecommerce and omnichannel solutions that seamlessly blend payment gateway services, retail payment acceptance infrastructure and payment technology service capabilities through a unified commerce platform to allow merchants to accept various payment methods through any channel across our geographical footprint. We sell ecommerce and omnichannel solutions to customers of all sizes, from small businesses accepting payments in a single country to enterprise and multinational businesses that have complex payment needs and operate retail and online businesses in multiple countries.  Relationship-Led. Through our relationship-led direct sales force worldwide, as well as bank and other referral partnerships, we offer our payments technology services, software and other value-added solutions directly to customers across numerous verticals in the markets we serve. We offer high-touch services that provide our customers with reliable and secure solutions coupled with high-quality and responsive support services. Although our primary focus is on building high-quality, direct relationships with merchants, we also provide our services to merchants through independent sales organizations (\"ISOs\") and financial institutions.  Credit and Debit Card Transaction Processing  Credit and debit card transaction processing includes the processing of the world's major international card brands, including, among others, American Express, Discover Card (\"Discover\"), JCB, Mastercard, UnionPay International and Visa, as well as certain domestic debit networks, such as Interac in Canada. Credit and debit networks establish uniform regulations that govern much of the payment card industry. During a typical payment transaction, the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other, but instead rely on payments technology companies, such as Global Payments, to facilitate transaction processing services, including authorization, electronic draft capture, file transfers to facilitate funds settlement and certain exception-based, back-office support services such as chargeback resolution.  We process funds settlement under two models: a sponsorship model and a direct membership model. Under the sponsorship model, member clearing financial institutions (\"Members\") sponsor us and require our adherence to the standards of the networks. In these markets, we have sponsorship or depository and clearing agreements with financial institution sponsors. These agreements allow us to route transactions under the Members' control and identification numbers to clear card transactions through Mastercard and Visa. In this model, the standards of the card networks restrict us from  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds, and, instead, require that these funds be in the possession of the Member until the merchant has been funded.  Under the direct membership model, we are direct members in various payment networks, allowing us to process and fund transactions without third-party sponsorship. Under this model, we route and clear transactions directly through the card brand\u2019s network and are not restricted from performing funds settlement. Otherwise, we process these transactions similarly to how we process transactions in the sponsorship model. We are required to adhere to the standards of the various networks in which we are direct members. We maintain relationships with financial institutions, which may also serve as our Member sponsors for other card brands or in other markets, to assist with funds settlement.  How a Card Transaction Works  A typical payment transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment to a merchant at which time card and transaction information, such as the card identification number, transaction date and transaction amount, is captured and transmitted to our network. The information is captured by a point-of-sale (\"POS\") terminal card reader or mobile device card reader, which may be sold or leased to the merchant and serviced by us, or through a POS device or ecommerce portal by one of a number of services that we offer directly or through a value-added reseller.   After the card and transaction information is captured, the POS device or ecommerce portal automatically connects to our network through the internet or other communication channel in order to receive authorization of the transaction. For a credit card transaction, authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction amount will cause the cardholder to exceed defined credit limits. In a debit card transaction, we obtain authorization for the transaction from the card issuer through the payment network verifying that the cardholder has access to sufficient funds for the transaction amount.  As an illustration, shown below in the sponsorship model, on a $100.00 card transaction the card issuer may fund the Member, our sponsor, (indirectly through the card network) $98.50 after retaining $1.50 referred to as an interchange fee. The card issuer would seek reimbursement of $100.00 from the cardholder in the cardholder's monthly credit card statement. The Member would, in turn, pay the merchant $100.00. The net settlement after this transaction would require us to advance the $1.50 interchange fee to the Member. After the end of the month, we would bill the merchant a percentage, also known as the merchant discount, of the transaction amount to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our fee from the transaction. Assuming the merchant discount in the above example is 2%, we bill the merchant $2.00 after the end of the month for the transaction, reimburse ourselves for $1.50 in interchange fees and retain $0.50 as our fee for the transaction. Under some arrangements, we remit the net amount of $98.00 to the merchant, rather than funding the full $100.00 and subsequently billing the merchant at the end of the month.   Discount rates vary based on negotiations with merchants and the economic characteristics of transactions and take many forms, such as interchange plus our fee or a bundled rate that includes all fees. Interchange rates also vary based on the economic characteristics of individual transactions. Accordingly, our fee per transaction varies across our merchant base and is subject to change based on changes in discount rates and interchange rates. Our profit on a transaction reflects the merchant discount less interchange fees, payment network fees and operating expenses, including systems costs to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or external partner. Payment network fees are charged by the card brands, in part, based on the value of transactions processed through their networks.  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents   Issuer Solutions Segment  Through our Issuer Solutions segment, we provide solutions that enable financial institutions and other financial service providers to manage their card portfolios, reduce technical complexity and overhead and offer a seamless experience for cardholders on a single platform. In addition, we provide flexible commercial payments, accounts payable and electronic payment alternatives solutions that support B2B payment processes for businesses and governments. We also offer complementary services, including account management and servicing, fraud solution services, analytics and business intelligence, cards, statements and correspondence, customer contact solutions and risk management solutions. Additionally, our Issuer Solutions segment provides B2B payment services and other financial service solutions marketed to corporations, including software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) offerings that automate key procurement processes, provide invoice capture, coding and approval, and enable virtual cards and integrated payments options across a variety of key vertical markets.   Issuer Solutions segment revenues are primarily derived from long-term processing contracts with financial institutions and other financial services providers. Payment processing services revenues are generated primarily from charges based on the number of accounts on file, transactions and authorizations processed, statements generated and/or mailed, managed services, cards embossed and mailed, and other processing services for cardholder accounts on file. Most of these customer contracts have prescribed annual minimums, penalties for early termination, and service level agreements that may affect contractual fees if specified service levels are not achieved. Issuer Solutions segment revenues also include software subscription, licensing fees, loyalty redemption services and professional services.  Consumer Solutions Segment  Our Consumer Solutions segment provides general purpose reloadable (\"GPR\") prepaid debit and payroll cards, demand deposit accounts and other financial service solutions to the underbanked and other consumers and businesses in the United States through our Netspend\u00ae and other brands. Through our Consumer Solutions segment, we provide customers with access to depository accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") with a menu of features specifically tailored to their needs. The Consumer Solutions segment has an extensive distribution and reload network comprised of financial service centers and other retail locations throughout the United States, and is a program manager for  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents FDIC-insured depository institutions that provide the services that the Consumer Solutions segment develops, promotes and distributes. Consumer Solutions currently has active agreements with four card-issuing banks.  The Consumer Solutions segment markets its services through multiple distribution channels, including alternative financial service providers, traditional retailers, direct-to-consumer and online marketing programs and contractual relationships with corporate employers. Consumer Solutions segment revenues principally consist of fees\u00a0collected from cardholders\u00a0and fees generated by cardholder activity in connection with the programs that we manage. Customers are typically charged a fee for each purchase transaction made using their cards, unless the customer is on a monthly or annual service plan, in which case the customer is instead charged a monthly or annual subscription fee, as applicable. Customers are also charged a monthly maintenance fee after a specified period of inactivity. We also charge fees associated with additional services offered in connection with programs we manage, including the use of overdraft features, a variety of bill payment options, card replacement, foreign exchange and card-to-card transfers of funds initiated through our call centers. Revenues are recognized net of fees charged by the payment networks for services they provide in processing transactions routed through them.  On July 31, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our consumer business, and that transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.  Competition  In each of our business segments, we compete with a large variety of companies - financial institutions, financial technology companies, traditional payment providers, new market entrants, and others, both large and small. The markets for the services we provide are highly fragmented and competitive. Many of these providers compete with us across our segments, markets and geographies. Some of these competitors possess greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do. We expect each of our segments to become more competitive over time, as advances in technology enable new entrants, barriers to entry fall and existing providers expand their services, both operationally and geographically.  Our Merchant Solutions segment competes with financial institutions, merchant acquirers and other financial technology companies who provide businesses with merchant acquiring and related services. In the United States, we compete with a large number of providers, including but not limited to Fiserv, Inc. (\"Fiserv\"), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (\"FIS\"), Chase Paymentech Solutions, LLC, Elavon, Inc., a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, Bank of America Merchant Services, Wells Fargo Merchant Services, Toast, Inc., Stripe, Inc., Shopify Inc. and Block Inc. (formerly known as Square, Inc.). While these are our primary competitors in the merchant acquiring space, our vertically focused businesses in the United States compete with numerous other providers in their respective verticals.  Internationally, financial institutions remain the primary providers of payment technology services to merchants, although the outsourcing of these services to third-party service providers is becoming more prevalent.  We compete outside the U.S. with financial institutions in the markets in which we operate, as well as both large providers (such as FIS, Worldline, Nexi) and new entrants (such as Adyen, Block and Stripe). We have seen competition internationally increase and expect that trend to continue as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand or consolidate their product lines and services.   Our Issuer Solutions segment encounters competition from other third-party payment card processors, the card brands, core banking platform providers, independent software vendors, B2B providers, and various other firms that deliver services to payment card issuers in the markets we serve, as well as financial institutions who provide such services in-house. Our competitors in this segment include, but are not limited to Fiserv, FIS, Marqeta, Nexi, Worldline, i2c, Bill.com, AvidExchange, Billtrust, Adyen and Stripe. We expect the number of competitors in this segment to continue to expand.      Our Consumer Solutions segment primarily competes with other demand deposit account and prepaid debit account program managers to provide financial service solutions to the underbanked and other consumers and businesses. Our primary competitors in this space include Green Dot Corporation, InComm, Fiserv and Chime.  See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business Model and Operations\u201d for further information on the competitive and continuously evolving markets we serve.  Safeguarding Our Business  In order to provide our services, we process and store sensitive business information and personal information, which may include credit and debit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, names and addresses, and other types of personal information or sensitive business information. Some of this information is also  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents processed and stored by financial institutions, merchants and other entities, as well as third-party service providers to whom we outsource certain functions and other agents, which we refer to collectively as our associated third parties. We may have responsibility to the card networks, financial institutions, and in some instances, our merchants, ISOs and/or individuals, for our failure or the failure of our associated third-party service providers (as applicable) to protect this information.  We are subject to cybersecurity and information theft risks in our operations, which we seek to manage through cyber and information security programs, training and insurance coverage. To strengthen our security and cyber defenses, we continue to deploy multiple methods at different layers to defend our systems against misuse, intrusions and cyberattacks and to protect the data we collect. Furthermore, we work with information security and forensics firms and employ advanced technologies to help prevent, investigate and address issues relating to processing system security and availability. We also collaborate with third parties, regulators and law enforcement, when appropriate, to resolve security incidents and assist in efforts to prevent unauthorized access to our processing systems.   Intellectual Property  Our intellectual property is an important part of our strategy to be a leading provider of payment technology and software solutions. We use a combination of internal policies, intellectual property laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies and brands. In addition, to protect our various brands, we seek and maintain registration of U.S. and international patents, trademarks, service marks and domain names that align with our brand strategy.\u00a0We also enforce our trademarks against potential sources of misunderstanding that could harm our brand and ability to compete. In addition to using our intellectual property in our own operations, we grant licenses to certain of our customers to use our intellectual property.  Human Capital Management  Team Member Population  We currently do business in over 170 countries around the world, with team members living and working in 33 of them. As of December\u00a031, 2022, our approximately 25,000 team member workforce represented approximately 80 nationalities and 19 natively spoken languages, with approximately 63% residing in the Americas, 15% residing in Europe and 22% residing in Asia Pacific. Many of our team members are highly skilled in technical areas specific to payment technology and software solutions.  Our overall workforce strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO. We regularly engage with our team members through a variety of forums, including periodic surveys, to help us understand their perspectives related to workplace culture, engagement, talent management and well-being and to inform our diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DEI\") strategies and initiatives. The results of these interactions are leveraged to further develop our talent management initiatives.  Talent Management and Retention  We place an emphasis on attracting and retaining premier and diverse team members. To that end, we have implemented programs and initiatives focused on enriching new hire experiences, developing team members through extensive training and professional development opportunities, including mentorship and leadership programs, promoting team members\u2019 wellness and safety, providing flexible work arrangements and offering comprehensive and competitive benefits packages, including paid parental leave, team member assistance and savings and retirement programs. Furthermore, we celebrate and recognize the efforts of all of our team members through a combination of programs, including team appreciation activities and annual awards programs to honor top performers and notable contributors. Over the past several years, we have also made significant investments in modernizing our operating environments and technologies to include cloud-based systems and collaboration tools that support day-to-day engagement and execution.       Health and Well-being  The success of our business is connected to the well-being of our team members. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our team members worldwide, and we provide team members with various health and wellness programs and benefits, including employee education and assistance programs that focus on physical, financial, social and emotional resources.  12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents Diversity, Equity and Inclusion   We remain committed to addressing the ever-changing needs of our team members and finding new ways to improve our culture. Our DEI strategy reflects the shift in our current workforce, changing business landscape and potential talent and is anchored by three pillars: Leadership Accountability, Inclusive Capability and Engagement. We have also broadened our focus to include social and racial equity in our conversations, and equip and empower our Employee Resource Group (\"ERG\") leaders with the right tools and training to lead their networks, including the launch of \u201cInclusion 365,\u201d an initiative to reinforce inclusion and belonging throughout our workforce. These efforts are further supported by our Chief Diversity Officer who leads a dedicated and specialized team designated to advance DEI within our Company. Our Compensation Committee assists the Board in overseeing the Company\u2019s DEI initiatives.  Employee Growth and Development  Our strategy to develop and retain the best talent includes an emphasis on team member development and training. We provide a variety of training and development opportunities to team members globally, including our online training platform that contains a vast array of tools and application resources for all team members to build learning experiences and skills. In order to help our team members strengthen the skills and behaviors needed for career advancement, our performance management program enables team members to drive their development with a focus on growth, performance, and well-being through regular meetings with their leaders.   Government Regulation  Various aspects of our business are subject to regulation and supervision under federal, state and local laws in the United States and foreign laws, regulations and rules. Many of these regulations and laws are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by courts and regulators, remain uncertain. These regulations and laws involve a variety of matters, including privacy and information security, data and personal information protection, money-transmission and payment instrument laws and regulations, consumer protection laws, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery laws, tax, environmental sustainability (including climate change), human rights and security regulations. In addition, we are subject to rules promulgated by the various payment networks, including Nacha, American Express, Discover, Interac, Mastercard and Visa.   Set forth below is a brief summary of some of the significant laws and regulations that apply to us. These descriptions are not exhaustive, and these laws, regulations and rules frequently change and are increasing in number. We are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable existing legal and regulatory requirements and do not expect that maintaining compliance with these regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive and financial positions. For additional information about government regulation and laws applicable to our business and the potential risks associated with future changes in laws or regulations, see \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor titled \"Legal, Regulatory Compliance and Tax Risks.\"   Dodd-Frank Act  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") restricts the amounts of debit card fees that certain institutions can charge merchants. Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, debit interchange rates for card issuers with assets of $10 billion or more are capped at $0.21 per transaction and an ad valorem component of 5 basis points to reflect a portion of the issuer's fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuers, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs.   In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act limits the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions because it allows merchants to: (i) set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card (and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards) and (ii) provide discounts or incentives to encourage consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards.  The rules also contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions that require a card issuer to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card, prohibit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements and restrict the ability of issuers or networks to mandate transaction routing requirements. The prohibition on network exclusivity has not significantly affected our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our customers, nor do we expect it to in the future.  The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"), which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has the  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company, such as us, should be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \"Federal Reserve\") on the ground that it is \"systemically important\" to the U.S. financial system. Accordingly, we may be subject to additional systemic risk-related oversight.  Money Transmission, Sale of Checks and Payment Instrument Laws and Regulations  Our Consumer Solutions segment is subject to money transfer and payment instrument licensing regulations and has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter, seller of checks and/or provider of payment instruments in 49 states and the District of Columbia.  Our Consumer Solutions segment is subject to direct supervision and regulation by the relevant state banking departments or similar agencies charged with enforcement of the relevant statutes and we must comply with various requirements, such as those related to the maintenance of a certain level of net worth, surety bonding, selection and oversight of our authorized agents, maintaining permissible investments in an amount equal to or in excess of our outstanding payment obligations, recordkeeping and reporting and disclosures to consumers. Our Consumer Solutions segment is also subject to periodic examinations by the relevant licensing authorities, which may include reviews of our compliance practices, policies and procedures, financial position and related records, various agreements that we have with our issuing banks, distributors and other third parties, privacy and data security policies and procedures and other matters related to our business.  Banking Laws and Regulations  Because we provide digital payment processing services to banks and other financial institutions, we are subject to examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (the \"FFIEC\"), an interagency body comprised primarily of federal banking regulators, and we are also subject to supervision or examination, as may be applicable, by various state and international financial regulatory agencies that supervise and regulate the financial institutions for which we provide digital payment processing and other payment related services. The FFIEC examines large data processors in order to identify and mitigate risks associated with systemically significant service providers, including specifically the risks they may pose to the banking industry.  Privacy and Data Protection Regulation  Aspects of our business are subject, directly or indirectly, to privacy and data protection regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere. In most of the countries in which we operate, these laws impose requirements on the manner in which personal information can be collected, processed, stored, and shared. They also impose requirements, which vary materially by jurisdiction, in the event of a personal data breach.  Compliance with the data protection regulations applicable to us or our customers requires increasing resources devoted to monitoring changes and developing solutions for our affected businesses. Maintaining compliance over time could require substantive technology infrastructure and process changes across many of the Company\u2019s businesses. Noncompliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) or similar regulations could lead to substantial regulatory fines and penalties, or damages from private causes of action. Evolving data localization requirements may affect how we provide services to customers in regions like the European Union. Additionally, evolving sector-specific regulations that affect the payments industry may introduce overlap or conflict with data privacy regulations, and these conflicts in regulatory requirements may affect our operations.   We also maintain processes to ensure that third parties upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities are similarly in compliance with applicable regulations. Such third parties include vendors and other partners.  New regulations (including new state laws in the United States or a possible federal privacy law) and new interpretations of existing regulations like the FTC Act and the GDPR could create new privacy rights for individuals and new obligations for companies handling personal information. These regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data and increase costs related to compliance.  In addition, emerging technologies including innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence have triggered new waves of regulation targeted to the specific risks anticipated from these technologies.  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents As our portfolio of services evolves, we may offer more services outside of our traditional business-to-business interaction context. As we interact directly with consumers, in conjunction with our existing customers and partners or directly on our own behalf, our compliance obligations under privacy regulations may expand.  Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Bribery and Sanctions Regulations  In many countries, we are legally or contractually required to comply with the anti-money laundering laws and regulations, such as, in the United States, the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act (collectively, the \"Bank Secrecy Act\"), and similar laws of other countries, which require that customer identifying information be obtained and verified. In some countries, we are directly subject to these requirements; in other countries, we have contractually agreed to assist our sponsor financial institutions with their obligation to comply with anti-money laundering requirements that apply to them. In addition, we and our sponsor financial institutions are subject to the laws and regulations enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"), which prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited persons or entities. Similar requirements apply in other countries. We have developed procedures and controls that are designed to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments and that allow our customers to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries, individuals or entities.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\"FinCEN\") has issued a rule regarding the applicability of the Bank Secrecy Act's anti-money laundering provisions to \"prepaid access programs.\" This rulemaking clarifies the anti-money laundering obligations for entities, such as our Consumer Solutions business and its distributors, engaged in the provision and sale of prepaid access devices like our GPR prepaid cards. Certain of our operating subsidiaries have registered with FinCEN as a money services business. This registration results in our having direct responsibility to maintain and implement an anti-money laundering compliance program for such subsidiaries.  We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar laws outside of the U.S. such as the U.K. Bribery Act, that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures. The FCPA has a broad reach and requires maintenance of appropriate records and adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations.  State Wage Payment Laws and Regulations  The use of payroll card programs as a means for an employer to remit wages or other compensation to its employees or independent contractors is governed by state labor laws related to wage payments, which laws are subject to change. The paycard portion of our business includes payroll cards and convenience checks and is designed to allow employers to comply with applicable state wage and hour laws. Most states permit the use of payroll cards as a method of paying wages to employees, either through statutory provisions allowing such use or, in the absence of specific statutory guidance, the adoption by state labor departments of formal or informal policies allowing for their use. Nearly every state allowing payroll cards places certain requirements and/or restrictions on their use as a wage payment method, the most common of which involve obtaining the prior written consent of the employee, limitations on fees and disclosure requirements.  Escheat Laws  We are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property state laws in the United States and in certain foreign countries that require us to transfer to certain government authorities the unclaimed property of others that we hold when that property has been unclaimed for a certain period of time. Moreover, we are subject to audit by state and foreign regulatory authorities with regard to our escheatment practices.  Debt Collection and Credit Reporting Laws  Portions of our business may be subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\") and similar state laws. These debt collection laws are designed to eliminate abusive, deceptive and unfair debt collection practices and may require licensing at the state level. The FCRA regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and also imposes disclosure requirements on entities that take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies.  15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents Telephone Consumer Protection Act  We are subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\") and various state laws to the extent we place telephone calls and short message service (\"SMS\") messages to customers and consumers. The TCPA regulates certain telephone calls and SMS messages placed using automatic telephone dialing systems or artificial or prerecorded voices.  Other  In addition, there are other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, that may directly affect us or the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services.  Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")  Certain governments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to ESG performance, transparency and reporting. Regulations may include mandated corporate reporting on ESG overall or in individual areas such as mandated reporting on climate-related financial disclosures. As part of our annual ESG reporting, we provide additional information about our approach to ESG matters in our Global Responsibility Report (which is not incorporated herein), which is available in the investor relations section of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.
