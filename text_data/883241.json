Background In this era of Smart Everything, we have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products, particularly mobile devices. The growth of the Internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create, store, and share information. At the same time, the increasing use of electronics in cars, buildings, appliances, and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of smart devices. Numerous software applications have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices. The increasing impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning is driving an increase in the activity of new and existing chip and system design companies around the world. These developments have been enabled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries. It is now common for a single chip to combine many components (processor, communications, memory, custom logic, input/output) and embedded software into a single system-on-chip (SoC), necessitating highly complex chip designs. The most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors. Transistors are the basic building blocks for ICs, each of which may have features that are less than 1/1,000th the diameter of a human hair.  These devices are manufactured using masks to direct beams of light onto a wafer of silicon. At such small dimensions, the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production, proving too big to create such  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches. Designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems, such as multiple-patterning lithography, FinFET 3D transistors and Gate-All-Around Field-Effect transistor structures, which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production. The popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance, reduced size, and lower power consumption. Our customers, who design those products, are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative offerings in shorter timeframes and at lower prices. In other words, innovation in chip and systems design often hinges on providing products \u201cbetter,\u201d \u201csooner,\u201d and \u201ccheaper\u201d than competitors. The design of these chips and systems is extremely complex and necessitates state-of-the-art solutions. Over the past several years, market verticals including AI, 5G, automotive and cloud computing infrastructure have contributed to the ongoing demand for our products and services. A similar dynamic is at work in the software arena, whether the software is embedded on a chip or used in other applications. The pace of innovation often requires developers to deliver more secure, high-quality software, which can include millions of lines of code, in increasingly frequent release cycles. Bugs, defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix. Despite these challenges, it is crucial to have high-quality, secure code to ensure consumers' privacy and safety, especially at a time when software is critical in many industries across a growing array of smart devices. Our Role\u2014As the Silicon to Software Partner Synopsys' Silicon to Software technologies and services are designed to help our customers\u2014chip and system engineers and software developers\u2014speed up time to market, achieve the highest quality of results, mitigate risk, and maximize profitability. Chip and systems designers must determine how best to design, locate and connect the building blocks of chips, and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and cost-effectively. This is a complex, multi-step process that is expensive and time-consuming. Our wide range of products help at different steps in the overall design process, from the design of individual ICs to the design of larger systems. Our products increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks, keeping track of large amounts of data, adding intelligence to the design process, facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors. Our IP products offer proven, high-quality pre-configured circuits that are ready to use in a chip design, saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products. Our global service and support engineers provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers. Software developers are responsible for writing code that not only accomplishes its goals as efficiently as possible but also runs securely and is free of defects. We offer products that can help developers write higher quality, more secure code by analyzing code for quality defects and known security vulnerabilities, adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process, and helping to eliminate defects in a systematic manner. As developers make use of open source software in their code, our products can help developers better manage the composition and security of the code. Our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle, when they are less costly to fix. Products and Services Design Automation Segment Our Design Automation segment includes the EDA and Other revenue groups.

Recruitment and Retention Our workforce is representative of the industry we serve. In fiscal 2023, we increased our employee headcount by approximately 7%, with a continued focus on promoting gender diversity with respect to those in technical and senior level positions and ensuring a vibrant talent pipeline with early career hiring and investment in training and development. As of our fiscal 2023 year-end, our undesired turnover rate was 2.7%.1  We attribute the strong retention of our talented workforce to a number of factors, including exciting and challenging assignments; growth opportunities; strong leadership and management; a culture of integrity; our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion; competitive and equitable compensation and benefits; our leading products and technology; and the strength of our customer relationships. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion We seek to integrate diversity, equity and inclusion into our corporate values at every level\u2014from our foundation of integrity to our execution excellence and from our dedicated leadership to our united passion for a better tomorrow. We strive to maintain a culture that values different perspectives and backgrounds, where everyone is treated with respect for who they are, and where people feel a sense of belonging. We believe this is not only essential for our success as a global leader in innovation, but also for the success of our employees in their own careers. We value the diversity of our teams, talent pipelines and pay and development programs, with a goal to ensure inclusive, equitable practices. We carefully study retention trends and feedback from diverse groups to identify areas where we can improve.  1  We calculate undesired turnover rate by dividing the number of undesired exits from Synopsys by the average headcount for fiscal 2023, and we define undesired turnover as exits by high-performing employees who resigned from Synopsys (or its subsidiaries) to pursue other work opportunities. Undesired turnover does not include employees with low performance, mutual resignations, or resignations due to personal reasons (e.g., retirement or returning to school). 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents As of our fiscal 2023 year-end: \u2022Women comprised 25.4% of our global workforce; \u2022Women in senior level positions comprised 13.1% of all senior level positions at the company; and \u2022U.S. Black, Latinx, and Indigenous persons comprised 5.8% of our U.S. workforce. We provide training designed to encourage equitable and inclusive behavior to attract, retain and develop our workforce. In addition, our Employee Resource Groups, which are vital to our Synopsys community, host events and implement actions to attract and engage diverse talent and foster an inclusive workplace. In fiscal 2023, we included workforce metrics such as diversity, employee retention and employee engagement as incentive plan goals for our executive officers to advance key diversity and human capital initiatives. We believe these initiatives help to ensure that we continue to seek out strong, diverse, qualified candidates, and that we develop and retain key talent. Total Rewards Our Total Rewards are designed to offer meaningful benefits and compensation for the time, energy, commitment, skills, and expertise employees bring to the company every day. We have practices in place that are intended to deliver fair and equitable compensation for employees based on their contribution and performance.

We also offer a comprehensive set of benefits for employees and their families, focused on physical, mental and financial health and wellbeing. Our compensation and benefit programs are tailored to the various geographies in which we operate, and for eligible employees may include: \u2022Market-competitive salary and cash bonus opportunity; \u2022Employee Stock Purchase Plan; \u2022Equity compensation; \u2022Robust medical, dental, vision, and wellness benefits; \u2022Comprehensive leave plans; \u2022Life insurance options; \u2022Retirement plans and associated benefits; \u2022Financial planning tools and employee assistance plans; \u2022Student loan repayment assistance; \u2022Cancer-specific prevention, early detection, treatment and support programs; and \u2022Parental resources and adoption benefits. Health, Safety and Wellbeing Our commitment to health, safety, and wellness was underscored this year by the support and resources we offered to help employees thrive in a hybrid work environment while balancing their personal lives. Through our Stronger Through Wellbeing campaign, our leaders and managers are encouraged to model the importance of health and wellbeing, and many create opportunities to engage in wellness-related activities as a team. We also offer a variety of programs and resources at no cost to employees and their family members to support their mental, emotional, and financial wellbeing. Employee Engagement We have a comprehensive employee feedback program, and we use the feedback to gain an understanding of the employee experience and to make improvements in a variety of areas\u2014from how we interact with customers to how we share best practices, and more. Through our semi-annual SHAPE Synopsys surveys, we obtain employee insight into our values, manager effectiveness, ability to innovate, perceptions on diversity, inclusion and belonging,  13 13 13 Table of Contents Table of Contents and other critical factors. We also use the surveys to create space for important conversations about who we are, where we are going, and how we can connect with each other and our work. Approximately 94% of our employees participated in our SHAPE survey in May 2023. We received an engagement score of 82, which is calculated by computing the average score set to a 100-point scale, for all employee responses to the questions pertaining to employee satisfaction and job satisfaction. These results demonstrate Synopsys' stability, resiliency, and a global workforce that is highly engaged. We saw strong scores from our employees regarding their connection to our culture, their personal investment in Synopsys\u2019 strategies and objectives, and their team\u2019s ability to innovate. As we grow, we aspire to maintain our results-oriented culture by balancing productivity with smart investments in our employees\u2019 development, while also supporting individual wellbeing\u2014two key drivers of the overall employee experience. We believe ongoing performance feedback encourages greater engagement in our business and improved individual performance. Each year, our employees participate in our performance development process that summarizes key accomplishments for the preceding year, establishes new stretch goals, and identifies critical capabilities for development. As part of this process, we encourage managers to solicit and share supportive multi-rater feedback, further strengthening the focus on teamwork and team success. Talent Development and Succession Planning We offer several programs to support the career advancement of our employees. Through our digital learning platform, we foster and support an \u201calways learning\u201d culture where employees can access training, external articles, videos, and blogs. In addition, we host a series of in-person and on-demand learning sessions designed to build capability and adaptability required for the future. As employees advance in their careers, our training framework is intended to build new capabilities on established foundational skills. Based upon the belief that our employees deserve great managers, our management training is designed to increase capability in the areas of communication, engagement, coaching, diversity, equity, and inclusion, hiring and on-boarding, and business skills and help promote an ethical and supportive work environment free from bias and harassment. In fiscal 2023, we introduced a new leadership training, and focused on helping our many managers thrive in connecting team work to company priorities while giving them the tools to be great coaches and leaders. In addition, our regions and business teams customize development programs for their specific needs.
