Our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value, technical expertise, innovation, digital technology, chemical formulations, global customer support, detection equipment, monitoring capabilities, and dosing and metering equipment. Through the combination of our digitally enabled end-to-end water management and hygiene solutions, data-driven insights and personalized service, our Global Industrial businesses deliver outcomes that help our customers optimize water and energy use, improve productivity, advance food safety, and achieve sustainability and net zero goals, while optimizing total cost of operations.\u200bThe businesses in our Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment and Other have two significant classes of competitors. First, we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Second, we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-use customer segments. We believe we compete principally by providing superior value, premium customer support, training, service, and innovative and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation and improve their operational efficiency.\u200bWithin the Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment, the Healthcare business competes geographically with companies primarily focused on a smaller range of product categories, with few globally scaled competitors. The Life Sciences business competes in the European market versus several mid-size and regional competitors and competes against two large and other mid-size or regional competitors in North America. Outside of North America and Europe competitors are much more fragmented and do not offer the same level of service or coverage as Ecolab. Our businesses in this segment compete by enabling our customers success through improved hygiene, digitally enabled programs in operating room and patient room space as well as a tailored approach to delivering key inputs that directly impact our customers patients globally.\u200bSales\u200bOur products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by our Company-trained direct field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and most efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation, water treatment and process chemistry needs. Independent, third-party distributors and, to a lesser extent, sales agents, are utilized in several markets, as described in the segment descriptions found above.\u200bCustomers and Classes of Products\u200bWe believe our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer. Additionally, although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constituted 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020, we do have customers and independent third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position. No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit.\u200bWe sold one class of products within the Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment which comprised 10% or more of consolidated net sales in the last three years. Sales of warewashing products were approximately 12%, 10%, and 11% of consolidated net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\u200bHuman Capital\u200bAs of December 31, 2022, Ecolab employed approximately 47,000 employees, including approximately 26,000 sales and service and 1,100 research, development, and engineering employees. Approximately 41% of the employees are employed in North America, 21% in Europe, 7% in Asia Pacific, 17% in Latin America, 6% in India, Middle East and Africa, and 8% in Greater China. \u200bWe are committed to developing a culture that is diverse, equitable, inclusive, and fully leverages our employees\u2019 talents as we work together to serve the needs of our customers. We believe in providing comprehensive training and career development opportunities and in compensating and rewarding our employees equitably. Our commitment to the safety of our employees, contractors and customers is evident in all we do, from the way we operate, to the products we develop and to the customers we serve. In addition, we are committed to promoting the health and well-being of our employees, our customers, and their customers by contributing to programs and initiatives that enhance the quality of life in the communities where they work and live. In support of these overall objectives, key areas of focus include: \u200bDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion: We have a long-standing belief that a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce is a critical foundation for the shared success of our employees, our company, our customers, and our communities. To build that strong foundation, we have worked to embed diversity and inclusion throughout all people processes, including recruitment, promotional practices, training and development, and total rewards. To help guide our work and ensure a broad commitment to progress, Ecolab utilizes a Diversity Council made up of senior leaders throughout our company and chaired by our CEO. We review key metrics and practices, including diverse representation, hiring practices, and retention with the Council and with senior executives and business leads monthly. We set diversity goals at or above market availability and utilize diverse slates for all hiring activity.\u200b\u200b\u200b8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Competition\u200bIn general, the markets in which the businesses in our Global Industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies, with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services.

Approximately 41% of the employees are employed in North America, 21% in Europe, 7% in Asia Pacific, 17% in Latin America, 6% in India, Middle East and Africa, and 8% in Greater China. \u200bWe are committed to developing a culture that is diverse, equitable, inclusive, and fully leverages our employees\u2019 talents as we work together to serve the needs of our customers. We believe in providing comprehensive training and career development opportunities and in compensating and rewarding our employees equitably. Our commitment to the safety of our employees, contractors and customers is evident in all we do, from the way we operate, to the products we develop and to the customers we serve. In addition, we are committed to promoting the health and well-being of our employees, our customers, and their customers by contributing to programs and initiatives that enhance the quality of life in the communities where they work and live. In support of these overall objectives, key areas of focus include: \u200bDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion: We have a long-standing belief that a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce is a critical foundation for the shared success of our employees, our company, our customers, and our communities. To build that strong foundation, we have worked to embed diversity and inclusion throughout all people processes, including recruitment, promotional practices, training and development, and total rewards. To help guide our work and ensure a broad commitment to progress, Ecolab utilizes a Diversity Council made up of senior leaders throughout our company and chaired by our CEO. We review key metrics and practices, including diverse representation, hiring practices, and retention with the Council and with senior executives and business leads monthly. We set diversity goals at or above market availability and utilize diverse slates for all hiring activity.\u200b\u200b\u200b Competition \u200b In general, the markets in which the businesses in our Global Industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies, with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services. Our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value, technical expertise, innovation, digital technology, chemical formulations, global customer support, detection equipment, monitoring capabilities, and dosing and metering equipment. Through the combination of our digitally enabled end-to-end water management and hygiene solutions, data-driven insights and personalized service, our Global Industrial businesses deliver outcomes that help our customers optimize water and energy use, improve productivity, advance food safety, and achieve sustainability and net zero goals, while optimizing total cost of operations. \u200b The businesses in our Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment and Other have two significant classes of competitors. First, we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Second, we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-use customer segments. We believe we compete principally by providing superior value, premium customer support, training, service, and innovative and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation and improve their operational efficiency. \u200b Within the Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment, the Healthcare business competes geographically with companies primarily focused on a smaller range of product categories, with few globally scaled competitors. The Life Sciences business competes in the European market versus several mid-size and regional competitors and competes against two large and other mid-size or regional competitors in North America. Outside of North America and Europe competitors are much more fragmented and do not offer the same level of service or coverage as Ecolab. Our businesses in this segment compete by enabling our customers success through improved hygiene, digitally enabled programs in operating room and patient room space as well as a tailored approach to delivering key inputs that directly impact our customers patients globally. \u200b Sales \u200b Our products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by our Company-trained direct field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and most efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation, water treatment and process chemistry needs. Independent, third-party distributors and, to a lesser extent, sales agents, are utilized in several markets, as described in the segment descriptions found above. \u200b Customers and Classes of Products \u200b We believe our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer. Additionally, although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constituted 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020, we do have customers and independent third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position. No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit. \u200b We sold one class of products within the Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment which comprised 10% or more of consolidated net sales in the last three years.

Healthcare purchases plastic films and parts to manufacture medical devices that serve the surgical and infection prevention markets. Pesticides used by Pest Elimination are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors. We also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems. We purchase more than 10,000 raw materials, with the largest single raw material representing approximately four percent of raw material purchases. Our raw materials, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture, are generally purchased on an annual contract basis and are ordinarily available in adequate quantities from a diverse group of suppliers globally. We have encountered supply chain disruptions with impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine and the overall energy crisis (mainly in Europe). These events have impacted the availability and cost of many raw materials. When practical, global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs.\u200bResearch and Development\u200bOur research and development program consists principally of developing and validating the performance of new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of those already existing, improving service program content, evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support. Key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, data science and predictive analytics, process and packaging engineering, digital and remote monitoring engineering and product dispensing technology. Substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research, development and engineering personnel. \u200bWe believe continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers. \u200bJoint Ventures\u200bOver time, we have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements, to achieve quicker operational scale, to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers. During 2022, the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures, in the aggregate, was approximately three percent. We will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic, technological and product reach.\u200bEnvironmental and Regulatory Considerations\u200bOur businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in our businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean-up, fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations. Similarly, the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations, including among others, air, water, chemical and product regulations, could impact the sales of some of our products or services. In addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products.\u200bAdditionally, although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below.\u200bIngredient Legislation: Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California Proposition 65, for example, label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by California.

Substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research, development and engineering personnel.  \u200b We believe continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers.  \u200b Joint Ventures \u200b Over time, we have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements, to achieve quicker operational scale, to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers. During 2022, the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures, in the aggregate, was approximately three percent. We will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic, technological and product reach. \u200b Environmental and Regulatory Considerations \u200b Our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in our businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean-up, fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations. Similarly, the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations, including among others, air, water, chemical and product regulations, could impact the sales of some of our products or services. In addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products. \u200b Additionally, although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below. \u200b Ingredient Legislation: Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California Proposition 65, for example, label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by California. Chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by several states.  \u200b 10 10  Table of ContentsEnvironmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in a number of states to date, and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures. Cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress in each of the past few years but has not passed, and several states are considering further regulations in this area. In 2017, California passed the Cleaning Product Right to Know Act of 2017, that required ingredient transparency on-line and on-label by 2020 and 2021, respectively. New York has proposed similar ingredient disclosure regulation. The U.S. Government is monitoring \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d initiatives through a variety of initiatives, including its \u201cDesign for the Environment\u201d (\u201cDfE\u201d)/\u201cSafer Choice\u201d program. DfE/Safer Choice has three broad areas of work (recognition of safer products on a DfE/Safer Choice label, development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals), and we are involved in these to varying degrees. Our Global Institutional and Global Industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stay-in-market expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern. To date, we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications. Such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows to date.\u200bTSCA: The nation\u2019s primary chemicals management law, the Toxic Substances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d), was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (\u201cLCSA\u201d) in 2016. The LCSA modernizes the original 1976 legislation, aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in commerce and improve the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (\u201cEPA\u201d) capability and authority to regulate existing and new chemical substances. For Ecolab, the TSCA changes mainly impact testing and submission costs for new and existing chemical substances in the United States. As a result of reform and administration changes, EPA reviews are resulting in the majority of new substances being regulated in some manner by the agency. Compliance with new requirements under TSCA are similar to the costs associated with REACH in the European Union, which is discussed below.\u200bREACH: The European Union has enacted a regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d), which aims to manage chemical safety risks. REACH established a European Chemicals Agency (\u201cECHA\u201d) in Helsinki, Finland, which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in Europe. We met all REACH registration requirements. To help manage this program, we have been simplifying our product lines and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements. In addition, Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, India, Chile and Colombia and other countries have implemented or are implementing similar requirements. In addition, the European Green Deal will include the revision of chemical management regulation to achieve a circular economy and toxic-free environment (Chemical Strategy for Sustainability) which may impact sales in Ecolab\u2019s raw material portfolio. Potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position.\u200bGHS: In 2003, the United Nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (\u201cGHS\u201d). GHS is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets (\u201cSDSs\u201d). Most countries in which we operate have adopted or are expected to adopt GHS-related legislation by 2023. The primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising SDSs and product labels. We have met applicable deadlines and are working toward a phased-in approach to mitigate the costs of GHS implementation in remaining countries (e.g., Peru, Chile, India). Potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position.\u200bPesticide and Biocide Legislation: Various international, federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. We manufacture and sell certain disinfecting, sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on hard environmental surfaces, in process fluids and on certain food products. Such products constitute \u201cpesticides\u201d or \u201cantimicrobial pesticides\u201d under the current definitions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\u201cFIFRA\u201d), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides. We maintain several hundred product registrations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by FIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state. While the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows to date, the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase. Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position.\u200bIn Europe, the Biocidal Products Regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products. We are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met all relevant deadlines of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances and biocide products. Anticipated registration costs, which will be incurred through the multi-year phase-in period, will be significant; however, these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position. The same is true for emerging biocide regulations in Asia.\u200b11 Table of Contents Table of Contents Environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in a number of states to date, and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures.

That business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. We have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements. \u200bFDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements: Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and foods. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food. The FDA codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality, safety and effectiveness. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing regulations for over-the-counter antiseptic drug products, which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the FDA. FDA regulations associated with the Food Safety Modernization Act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines. To date, such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\u200bMedical Device and Drug Product Requirements: As a manufacturer, distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs, we also are subject to regulation by the FDA and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state, local and foreign governments in which we sell our products. These regulations govern the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products, including Advanced Pharmaceutical Ingredients (\u201cAPI\u201d), excipients and resins for biopharmaceutical processing. We also are required to register with the FDA as a medical device and drug manufacturer, comply with post-market reporting (e.g., Adverse Event Reporting, MDR and Recall) requirements, and to comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices and Quality System Regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the United States and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing, testing and control activities. Countries in the European Union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a \u201cCE mark,\u201d an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards, and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements (e.g., Medical Device Directive 93/42/EE, Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (\u201cMDR\u201d), and ISO 13485). We have CE mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in Europe. Implementation of the MDR will require additional certifications and investments, including system, product and process upgrades. Our other international non-European operations also are subject to government regulation and country-specific rules and regulations. Regulators at the federal, state and local level have imposed, are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products. No prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations, and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products.\u200bEquipment: Ecolab\u2019s products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements, as well as being subject to UL, NSF, and other approval requirements. For certain digitally connected product offerings, Federal Communication Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) and corresponding international requirements are applicable. We have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and third-party production of our equipment. We are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance. To date, such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\u200bOther Environmental Legislation: Our manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the United States are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air, land and water. The products we produce and distribute into Europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste (WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU) and restrictive substances (RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU). Similar legal requirements apply to Ecolab\u2019s facilities globally. We make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety projects worldwide were approximately $35 million in 2022, $28 million in 2021 and $18 million in 2020. Approximately $41 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2023. The increase in the projected spend reflects a return to historical annual expenditure levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u200bClimate Change: Various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international, national, regional and state levels, particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These include proposed regulations introduced by the SEC in March 2022 relating to climate change disclosure and the European Commission\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which came into force in December 2022 and will apply to both EU and certain non-EU companies with a phased introduction. These laws may directly impact the Company. We continue to monitor the development and implementation of such laws and regulations; however, as a matter of corporate policy, we support a balanced approach to reducing GHG emissions while sustaining economic growth.\u200b\u200b12 Table of Contents Table of Contents In addition, Pest Elimination applies restricted-use pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties.

Our capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety projects worldwide were approximately $35 million in 2022, $28 million in 2021 and $18 million in 2020. Approximately $41 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2023. The increase in the projected spend reflects a return to historical annual expenditure levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u200bClimate Change: Various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international, national, regional and state levels, particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These include proposed regulations introduced by the SEC in March 2022 relating to climate change disclosure and the European Commission\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which came into force in December 2022 and will apply to both EU and certain non-EU companies with a phased introduction. These laws may directly impact the Company. We continue to monitor the development and implementation of such laws and regulations; however, as a matter of corporate policy, we support a balanced approach to reducing GHG emissions while sustaining economic growth.\u200b\u200b In addition, Pest Elimination applies restricted-use pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties. That business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. We have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements.  \u200b FDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements: Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and foods. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food. The FDA codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality, safety and effectiveness. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing regulations for over-the-counter antiseptic drug products, which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the FDA. FDA regulations associated with the Food Safety Modernization Act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines. To date, such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \u200b Medical Device and Drug Product Requirements: As a manufacturer, distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs, we also are subject to regulation by the FDA and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state, local and foreign governments in which we sell our products. These regulations govern the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products, including Advanced Pharmaceutical Ingredients (\u201cAPI\u201d), excipients and resins for biopharmaceutical processing. We also are required to register with the FDA as a medical device and drug manufacturer, comply with post-market reporting (e.g., Adverse Event Reporting, MDR and Recall) requirements, and to comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices and Quality System Regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the United States and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing, testing and control activities. Countries in the European Union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a \u201cCE mark,\u201d an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards, and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements (e.g., Medical Device Directive 93/42/EE, Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (\u201cMDR\u201d), and ISO 13485). We have CE mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in Europe. Implementation of the MDR will require additional certifications and investments, including system, product and process upgrades. Our other international non-European operations also are subject to government regulation and country-specific rules and regulations. Regulators at the federal, state and local level have imposed, are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products. No prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations, and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products. \u200b Equipment: Ecolab\u2019s products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements, as well as being subject to UL, NSF, and other approval requirements. For certain digitally connected product offerings, Federal Communication Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) and corresponding international requirements are applicable. We have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and third-party production of our equipment. We are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance. To date, such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \u200b Other Environmental Legislation: Our manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the United States are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air, land and water. The products we produce and distribute into Europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste (WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU) and restrictive substances (RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU). Similar legal requirements apply to Ecolab\u2019s facilities globally. We make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety projects worldwide were approximately $35 million in 2022, $28 million in 2021 and $18 million in 2020.

We report TCFD disclosures in our annual CDP Climate report located at https://www.ecolab.com/sustainability/sustainability-reporting-resources. We are evaluating further application of the recommendations of the TCFD in alignment with the recommended timeline from the TCFD.\u200bEcolab recognizes that climate change poses potential risks and creates potential opportunities to our organization. Ecolab has taken steps to further identify and assess the nature and magnitude of these risks and opportunities. Ecolab has been focused on assessing climate risks for the past three years, leading up to our TCFD-aligned climate risk assessment conducted in 2021. We expect to continue our efforts to assess additional climate-related risks and opportunities including, exploring our supply chain resiliency, as appropriate. Subsequently, Ecolab plans to review the results of our analysis and consider adaptation and management plans for any relevant climate change risks and to further benefit from identified opportunities for customer impact.\u200bTo further our climate commitment, in 2019 we announced new goals to reduce our GHG emissions by half by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050, in alignment with the United Nations Global Compact\u2019s Business Ambition for 1.5\u2070C. In 2020, we further committed to attempt to move to 100% renewable energy by 2030 and set a science-based target (SBT) addressing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions. Our SBT targets reduction of absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2018 base year, and to work with our suppliers representing 70% of our Scope 3 emissions to set science-based reduction targets by 2024. In 2021, we invested over $1.2 million in continuous improvement projects focused on water and energy reductions at over 20 of our facilities across the globe. In all, these projects reduced annual energy consumption by almost 5.4 billion BTUs, reduced GHG emissions by 324 MT CO2e and saved 27 million gallons (~103,000 cubic meters) of water across our global supply chain manufacturing facilities. The scope of energy consumption reductions is calculated using a combination of direct measurements and estimations using best-practice methodologies. The scope of reduction in GHG emissions consumption data is an estimated annual impact and includes both Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Water reduction is calculated using the water meters and utilities data that measure the savings since our base year of calculations which was 2018. \u200bIn addition to managing our operational and supply chain sustainability performance, we partner with customers at more than three million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and GHG emissions through our high-efficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation, water, paper, and energy services. Showcasing our global team\u2019s dedication to helping our customers thrive and make a positive impact in the world, we have set a 2030 goal to help our customers reduce their GHG emissions by 6.0 million metric tons. Ecolab recognizes the climate-water nexus. As part of our 2030 Impact Goals, we have planned to restore greater than 50% of our water withdrawal and achieve Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard certification in high-risk watersheds. In addition, we aim to reduce net water withdrawals by 40% per unit of production across our enterprise. We also magnify our impact through the water-saving solutions we deliver to our customers and have set a goal to help our customers conserve more than 300 billion gallons of water annually by 2030.\u200bThe science of sustainability is an evolving one. For a discussion of the factors that may cause our sustainability initiatives, goals and targets to differ from those expressed above, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K, entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\u200bEnvironmental Remediation and Proceedings: Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (\u201cPRP\u201d), we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean-up activities imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) or state equivalents at 17 sites in the United States. Additionally, we have similar liability at five sites outside the United States. In general, under CERCLA, we and each other PRP that actually contributed hazardous substances to a Superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. \u200bBased on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings, our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph, and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other PRPs which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares, we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites. In establishing accruals, potential insurance reimbursements are not included. The accrual is not discounted. It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes.\u200bWe have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances, including multi-party lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services. While we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information, there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\u200bWe have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries, but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future, and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures. In each of these chemical exposure cases, our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf (with or without reservation) and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible; however, we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance.13 Table of Contents Table of Contents Furthermore, climate-related risks are assessed within our Enterprise Risk Management process and Annual Business Significance Risks Assessment, which is aligned with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Risk Factors.\u200bThe following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K. See the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d set forth above. \u200bWe may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in other forward-looking statements including those made in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public. \u200bEconomic & Operational Risks\u200bOur results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors. \u200bThe COVID pandemic, geopolitical instability, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and other global events have significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. Some of the results of these events, including supply chain challenges, inflation, high interest rates, foreign currency exchange volatility, and volatility in global capital markets, have affected our business in the past and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business in the future. Countries such as Russia, Turkey and Argentina have recently experienced economic upheaval and similar upheaval in other countries with Ecolab operations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity, including in our key end-markets, and by further weakening the local currency versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations, which are generated in the local currency, and then translated to U.S. dollars.\u200bOur results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve.\u200bEconomic downturns, and in particular downturns in our larger markets including the foodservice, hospitality, travel, health care, food processing, refining, pulp and paper, mining and steel industries, can adversely impact our customers. In particular, we expect a more challenging macroeconomic environment, especially in Europe, as the war and the energy crisis are having a significant impact on costs and demand. Additionally, the last three years we have experienced the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for our products and services provided to customers in the full-service restaurant, hospitality, lodging and entertainment industries. In prior years, the weaker global economic environment has also negatively impacted certain of our end-markets. During these periods of weaker economic activity, our customers and potential customers may reduce or discontinue their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\u200bOur significant non-U.S. operations expose us to global economic, political and legal risks that could impact our profitability.\u200bWe have significant operations outside the United States, including joint ventures and other alliances. We conduct business in more than 170 countries and, in 2022, approximately 47% of our net sales originated outside the United States. There are inherent risks in our international operations, including: \u200b\u25cfexchange controls and currency restrictions;\u25cfcurrency fluctuations and devaluations; \u25cftariffs and trade barriers; \u25cfexport duties and quotas;\u25cfchanges in the availability and pricing of raw materials, energy and utilities; \u25cfchanges in local economic conditions; \u25cfchanges in laws and regulations, including the imposition of economic or trade sanctions affecting international commercial transactions; \u25cfdifficulties in managing international operations and the burden of complying with international and foreign laws; \u25cfrequirements to include local ownership or management in our business; \u25cfeconomic and business objectives that differ from those of our joint venture partners;\u25cfexposure to possible expropriation, nationalization or other government actions; \u25cfrestrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries; \u25cfunsettled political conditions, military action, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict; and \u25cfcountries whose governments have been hostile to U.S.-based businesses. \u200bIn light of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the United States\u2019 and other countries\u2019 sanctions against Russia, we announced in April 2022 that we will focus our Russian business on operations that are essential to life, providing minimal support for our healthcare, life sciences, food and beverage and certain water businesses. We may further narrow our presence in Russia depending on developments in the conflict or otherwise. Our Russian operations represented approximately 1% for both our 2022 and 2021 annual sales. During 2022 we recorded pre-tax charges of $13.1 million related to recoverability risk of certain assets in both Russia and Ukraine. Depending on developments, we may incur further charges relating to our Russia and Ukraine businesses. The conflict in Ukraine may escalate and/or expand in scope and the broader consequences of this conflict, which have included and/or may in the future include sanctions, embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts; potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, including us, such as nationalization of foreign businesses in Russia; and increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate cannot be predicted, nor can we predict the conflict\u2019s impact on the global economy and on our business and financial results.
