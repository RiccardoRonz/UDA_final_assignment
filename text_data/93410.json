Business  General Development of Business  Summary Description of Chevron  Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S.\u00a0and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the company\u2019s significant subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit\u00a021.1. Overview of Petroleum Industry  Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns, the pace of energy transition and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations, select feedstocks, and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals.  Operating Environment  Refer to pages 32 through 40 of this Form\u00a010-K in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company\u2019s current business environment and outlook. Chevron\u2019s Strategic Direction Chevron\u2019s strategy is to leverage our strengths to safely deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. Our primary objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. We are building on our capabilities, assets and customer relationships as we aim to lead in lower carbon intensity oil, products and natural gas, as well as advance new products and solutions that reduce the carbon emissions of major industries. We aim to grow our traditional oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow new lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture, offsets, and other emerging technologies.

Hiring, Development and Retention The company\u2019s approach to attracting, developing and retaining a global, diverse workforce of high-performing talent is anchored in a long-term employment model that fosters an environment of personal growth and engagement. Chevron\u2019s philosophy is to offer compelling career opportunities and a competitive total compensation and benefits package linked to individual and enterprise performance. Chevron recruits new employees in part through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to provide specialized skills. Chevron\u2019s learning and development programs are designed to help employees achieve their full potential by building technical, operating and leadership capabilities at all levels to produce energy safely, reliably and efficiently. Chevron\u2019s leadership regularly reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are continually refined to meet the needs of our evolving business. The company invests in developing leadership at every level. For example, Chevron expanded a coaching program that reaches deeper into the organization, including frontline supervisors, managers and individual contributors.   In addition, to ensure business continuity, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for key positions. The Board of Directors provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning.  Management routinely reviews the retention of its professional population, which includes executives, all levels of management, and the majority of its regular employee population. The annual voluntary attrition for this population was 4.5 percent, which is in line with rates over a five-year comparison period. The voluntary attrition rate generally excludes employee departures under enterprise-wide restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the company\u2019s commitment to employee development, its long-term employment model, competitive pay and benefits, and its culture.  4 4 4 Table of Contents  Table of Contents Table of Contents Diversity and Inclusion Chevron believes human ingenuity has the power to solve difficult problems when diverse people, ideas and experiences come together in an inclusive environment. Chevron reinforces the values of diversity and inclusion through recruitment and talent development, equitable selection processes, community partnerships and supplier diversity. Chevron strives to build an inclusive environment through innovative programs such as the company\u2019s MARC (Men Advocating Real Change) program launched in 2017, in partnership with the non-profit organization Catalyst, to facilitate discussions on gender equity in the workplace. MARC is active in over 35 Chevron locations on six continents around the world with over 5,000 participants since inception. Also, when hiring for a position, many selection processes now include inclusion counselors who help check against unconscious biases and provide outside perspectives.  Chevron\u2019s leadership development also reflects Chevron\u2019s diversity focus.  In 2022, Chevron offered numerous leadership programs to promote leadership diversity, including the Global Women\u2019s Leadership Development Program, Transformational Leadership for Multicultural Women, Executive Leadership Council (U.S. Black employees), Asia Pacific Leadership Development Program, Asian American Leadership Development Program, and Latino Leadership Development Program. In addition, Chevron has 11 employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or interests) and a Chairman\u2019s Inclusion Council, which provides the employee network presidents with a direct line of communication to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and the executive leadership team to collaborate and discuss how employee networks can reinforce Chevron\u2019s values of diversity and inclusion. Employee Engagement  Employee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the company\u2019s values, purpose and strategies. Chevron regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the company\u2019s culture; recent surveys indicate high employee engagement. Chevron\u2019s survey frequency enables the company to better understand employee sentiment throughout the year and gain insights into employee well-being. The company also introduced surveys to understand employee experience trends throughout the employee lifecycle.  Chevron prioritizes the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Chevron\u2019s safety culture empowers every member of its workforce to exercise stop-work authority without repercussion to address any potential unsafe work conditions. The company has set clear expectations for leaders to deliver operational excellence by demonstrating their commitment to prioritizing the safety and health of its workforce, and the protection of communities, the environment and the company\u2019s assets. Additionally, the company offers long-standing employee support programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and an Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns. In February, Chevron received the 2023 Platinum Bell Seal for Workplace Mental Health by Mental Health America. The Bell Seal is a first-of-its-kind workplace mental health certification that recognizes employers who strive to create mentally healthy workplaces for their employees.           5 5   5  Table of Contents  Table of Contents Table of Contents Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects* in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.

Chevron\u2019s 2022 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in the section Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are presented below. The comments include references to \u201ctotal production\u201d and \u201cnet production,\u201d which are defined under \u201cProduction\u201d in Exhibit\u00a099.1.  The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment.   United States Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, California, and the Gulf of Mexico. Acreage for the United States can be found in the Acreage table. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be found in the Net Production of Crude Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas table. As one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, Chevron continues to capitalize on its advantaged portfolio in west Texas and southeast New Mexico with an outlook of one million barrels of net oil equivalent production per day by 2025. The asset is comprised of stacked formations enabling production from multiple geologic zones from single surface locations and staging the development for optimized capacity utilization of facilities and infrastructure. The company has implemented a factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are subsequently completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. This manufacturing-style process, combined with advantaged acreage holdings and technological advancements, have enabled capital expenditure productivity improvements. Continued operational efficiencies and diversified land assets via non-operated joint ventures and royalty positions have also contributed to higher returns throughout the Permian portfolio. In addition to ongoing emission reduction and water handling initiatives, construction of a 50 percent joint venture solar power project in New Mexico to supply renewable energy for our oil and gas operations was completed and is expected to be operational in the first half of 2023. In 2022, Chevron\u2019s net daily unconventional production in the Permian Basin averaged 327,000 barrels of crude oil, 184,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas.  Chevron divested its assets in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas in March 2022. In Colorado, development in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin is primarily focused on Chevron\u2019s Mustang and Wells Ranch areas where the company\u2019s comprehensive drilling plans allow for efficient resource development. In 2022, Chevron\u2019s net daily production in the DJ Basin averaged 53,000 barrels of crude oil, 37,000 barrels of NGLs and 325 million cubic feet of natural gas. Chevron also has operations in Colorado\u2019s Piceance Basin, as well as an acreage position in Wyoming.  In 2022, 53 wells in Texas and 29 wells in Colorado achieved Project Canary\u2019s highest certification rating on operational and environmental performance, allowing Chevron to market responsibly sourced natural gas. In 2022, Chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in California with a net daily oil equivalent production of 87,800 barrels. The California operations support Chevron\u2019s efforts to progress its lower carbon technologies with investments in geothermal and carbon capture pilots. These include the Baseload Capital pilot to utilize waste heat from existing oilfield operations and the Svante pilot to capture carbon dioxide from combustion of natural gas. These pilots leverage innovative technologies and have the potential to scale across our operations. The Baseload Capital and Svante pilots became operational in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively. During 2022, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 172,000 barrels of crude oil, 12,000 barrels of NGLs and 101 million cubic feet of natural gas. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron also holds nonoperated interests in several shelf fields. The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Additional development opportunities for the Jack and St. Malo fields progressed in 2022. The St. Malo Stage 4 waterflood project includes two new production wells, three injector wells, and topsides water injection equipment at the St. Malo Field. First water  10 10 10 Table of Contents  Table of Contents Table of Contents injection is expected in 2024.
