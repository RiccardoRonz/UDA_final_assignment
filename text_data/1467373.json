Our Strategy The core of our growth strategy is delivering 360\u00b0 value to our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities by helping them continuously reinvent.

We are investing and co-creating with clients and partners to lead in helping our clients thrive across these forces, which we expect to have different time horizons. Today, the demand we continue to see across our geographic markets, services and industries is being primarily driven by the first two, as companies are in the early stages of harnessing these forces. We have summarized below each of the five key forces as we currently see them evolving. \u2022Total enterprise reinvention, as we believe every part of every business must be transformed by technology, data and AI, with new ways of working and engaging with customers, employees and partners, and new business models, products and services.

We serve clients at any given time in more than 120 countries, with offices and operations in 49 countries. The majority of our people are in India, the Philippines and the U.S. We have a culture of shared success, which is defined as success for our clients, our people, our shareholders, our partners and our communities. That culture is built upon four tangible building blocks\u2014our beliefs, our behaviors, the way we develop and reward our people and the way we do business. Our Beliefs and Behaviors  Our leadership essentials set the standard for what we expect of all our people: \u2022always do the right thing, in every decision and action;\u2022lead with excellence, confidence and humility, as demonstrated by being a learner, building great teams and being naturally collaborative; \u2022exemplify client-centricity and a commitment to client value creation; \u2022act as a true partner, to each other, our clients, our ecosystem and our communities\u2014committed to shared success;\u2022care deeply for all our people to help them achieve their aspirations professionally and personally;\u2022live our unwavering commitment to inclusion, diversity and equality, as demonstrated by personal impact and overall results; \u2022have the courage to change and the ability to bring our people along the journey; and\u2022actively innovate\u2014seeking new answers, applying a tech, AI and data first mindset, looking internally across Accenture and outside\u2014to partners, competitors, start-ups, clients, academia and analysts\u2014to learn, respectfully challenge our assumptions and apply the innovation, and cultivate and reward our people for doing the same. \u2022always do the right thing, in every decision and action; \u2022lead with excellence, confidence and humility, as demonstrated by being a learner, building great teams and being naturally collaborative;  \u2022exemplify client-centricity and a commitment to client value creation;  \u2022act as a true partner, to each other, our clients, our ecosystem and our communities\u2014committed to shared success; \u2022care deeply for all our people to help them achieve their aspirations professionally and personally; \u2022live our unwavering commitment to inclusion, diversity and equality, as demonstrated by personal impact and overall results;  \u2022have the courage to change and the ability to bring our people along the journey; and \u2022actively innovate\u2014seeking new answers, applying a tech, AI and data first mindset, looking internally across Accenture and outside\u2014to partners, competitors, start-ups, clients, academia and analysts\u2014to learn, respectfully challenge our assumptions and apply the innovation, and cultivate and reward our people for doing the same. Listening to the voices of our people provides the input to ensure that they have the tools and resources to do their jobs and the right learning opportunities, and that they experience a positive, respectful and inclusive work environment. We do this on an ongoing basis across various channels, including surveys and forums. One of our surveys, which was conducted in November 2022 and measures how our people experience our culture, shows that 91% of our global respondents believe they can work to their potential because they are in an environment where they are treated with respect and in an appropriate manner.  Our purpose is to deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity. Our strategy is to deliver 360\u00b0 value for all our stakeholders by helping them continuously reinvent. To drive reinvention, innovation must be at the forefront, which requires us to attract, develop and inspire top talent. Talent is one of our most important areas of competitive differentiation. As part of our talent strategy, we hire and develop people who have different backgrounds, different perspectives, and different lived experiences. These differences ensure that we have and attract the cognitive diversity to deliver a variety of perspectives, observations, and insights which are essential to drive the innovation needed to reinvent. To help achieve this diversity we set goals, share them publicly, and collect data to measure our progress, continuously improve, and hold our leaders accountable for ensuring we have the most innovative and talented people in our industry. This approach is a key driver of our progress. We recognize that some people come to Accenture having faced obstacles as an aspect of their identity or lived experience. At Accenture, we are committed to harness these perspectives and ensure that all of our people have the opportunity to thrive and unlock their full potential. We are a meritocracy. Our intention is to foster a culture and a workplace in which all of our people feel a sense of belonging and are respected and empowered to do their best work and to create 360\u00b0 value for all our stakeholders.

We upskill people at scale, while proactively defining new skills and roles in anticipation of client needs. We expect to double our Data & AI Practice to 80,000 people through hiring, training and acquisitions over the next three years. We are focused on rigorous, job-specific training through key industry certifications and partnerships with leading universities around the globe. We also train our people on inclusion and mitigating unconscious bias. We promoted approximately 123,000 people in fiscal 2023, demonstrating our continued commitment to creating vibrant careers and opportunities for our people. We balance our supply of skills with changes in client demand. We do this through adjusting levels of new hiring and managing our attrition (both voluntary and involuntary). We believe people are drawn to our strong purpose, values and reputation. For fiscal 2023, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 13%, down from 19% in fiscal 2022. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 14%, up from 13% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated actions to streamline operations and transform our nonbillable corporate functions to reduce costs. Accenture\u2019s total rewards consist of cash compensation, equity and a wide range of benefits. Our total rewards program is designed to recognize our people\u2019s skills, contributions and career progression. Base salary, bonus and equity are tailored to the market where our people work and live. Certain rewards, like equity and bonuses, are opportunities for our people to share in the overall success of our company. As our people advance in their careers, they have greater opportunities to be rewarded. Accenture\u2019s equitable rewards go beyond financial rewards and include health and well-being programs that care for our people.

We have a strong commitment to environmental sustainability in how we operate our business, and we hold ourselves accountable to clear and measurable objectives. Our environment goals span three areas: reducing our carbon emissions including through nature-based carbon removal programs, moving toward zero waste and planning for water risk. Reducing our Carbon Emissions The most significant aspects of our environmental footprint are the greenhouse gas emissions related to electricity used in our locations, as well as business travel and purchased goods and services.  In 2020, we signed the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C Pledge, joining leading companies in pledging to do our part to keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0 Celsius, in alignment with the Paris Agreement and the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We are continuing to work toward our goal of net-zero emissions by 2025 by first focusing on reductions across our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and then removing any remaining emissions through nature-based carbon removal projects. We are also establishing new goals to align with the SBTi\u2019s criteria, guidance and recommendations for setting science-based net-zero targets. In 2023, we set a new, near-term target aligned to 2030, which was approved by the SBTi.  Carbon Reduction Our approach to carbon reduction in support of our goals includes: \u2022Renewable electricity. In 2023, we achieved our goal of 100% renewable electricity in our offices. As we do not own our office buildings and procure most of our energy from the grid, we increase our renewable electricity by purchasing renewable electricity contracts equivalent to the amount of electricity we consume. Going forward, we plan to maintain 100% renewable electricity on an annual basis through continued purchase of renewable electricity contracts. As we purchase renewable electricity, we also support the generation of more renewable sources of electricity.Achieved100% renewable electricity by the end of 2023\u2022Enabling low carbon business travel. We continue to use technology to facilitate more cost and carbon-efficient delivery for our clients and our business and have implemented an internal carbon price on travel to encourage climate smart travel decisions. In addition, we have developed analytics and reporting focused on our business travel emissions so that we can share emissions data with our clients as part of our delivery activities.\u2022Engaging our suppliers. We are working with our suppliers to reduce our Scope 3 emissions. Our goal is that 90% of our key suppliers disclose their environmental targets and the actions being taken to reduce emissions by the end of 2025. Our suppliers are making good progress, with 68% of key suppliers disclosing their targets and 75% disclosing the actions they are taking as of December 2022. Key suppliers are defined as vendors that represent a significant portion of our 2019 Scope 3 emissions. \u2022Renewable electricity.

To offset our remaining emissions, we are investing in nature-based carbon removal solutions to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Our nature-based carbon removal projects will also support and respect the universal principles of the UNGC in the relevant areas of human rights, labor, environment, anticorruption and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

We have a goal of reusing or recycling 100% of our e-waste, such as computers and servers, as well as all our office furniture, by the end of 2025. During fiscal 2023, we reused or recycled nearly 100% of our e-waste relating to computers, servers and uninterruptible power supply devices. We continue to refine our processes, leverage our asset tracking system and work with vendors to help us extend the life cycle of our furniture, including through refurbishment and reuse or recycling. \u2022Eliminate single-use plastics in our office locations. During fiscal 2023, we eliminated single-use plastics in our office locations by purchasing reusable and plastic-free items.  Planning for Water Risk \u2022Mitigating the potential impacts of climate change-related water risk. Although Accenture is not a water-intensive company, to safeguard our people and operations we are developing water resiliency action plans to reduce the impact of climate-related flooding, drought and water scarcity on our business and our people in high-risk areas.
