{"cik": 1800, "item_1A": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS Abbott Laboratories is an Illinois corporation, incorporated in 1900. Abbott\u2019s* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. Established Pharmaceutical Products These products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and sold outside the United States in emerging markets. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers or public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with, or licensed from, other companies. The principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are: \u2022gastroenterology products, including Creon\u2122, for the treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency associated with several underlying conditions, including cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis; Duspatal\u2122 and Dicetel\u2122, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome or biliary spasm; Heptral\u2122, Transmetil\u2122, and Samyr\u2122, for the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis (associated with liver disease) or depressive symptoms; and Duphalac\u2122, for regulation of the physiological rhythm of the colon; \u2022women\u2019s health products, including Duphaston\u2122, for the treatment of many different gynecological disorders; and Femoston\u2122, a hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women; \u2022cardiovascular and metabolic products, including Lipanthyl\u2122 and TriCor\u2122, for the treatment of dyslipidemia; Teveten\u2122 and Teveten\u2122 Plus, for the treatment of essential hypertension, and Physiotens\u2122, for the treatment of hypertension; and Synthroid\u2122, for the treatment of hypothyroidism; \u2022pain and central nervous system products, including Serc\u2122, for the treatment of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease and vestibular vertigo; Brufen\u2122, for the treatment of pain, fever, and inflammation; and Sevedol\u2122, for the treatment of severe migraines; and \u2022respiratory drugs and vaccines, including the anti-infective clarithromycin (sold under the trademarks Biaxin\u2122, Klacid\u2122, and Klaricid\u2122); and Influvac\u2122, an influenza vaccine. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building strong brands with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers. Competition in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures. ________________________________________________________ *As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the term \u201cAbbott\u201d refers to Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. 1 1 1 Table of Contents Table of Contents Diagnostic Products These products include a broad line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide.

Primary marketing efforts for nutritional products are directed toward consumers or to securing the recommendation of Abbott\u2019s brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. In addition, nutritional products are also promoted directly to the public by consumer marketing efforts in markets where permitted. 2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents Competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers\u2019 products may increase competitive pressure. Medical Devices These products include a broad line of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally marketed and sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians\u2019 offices, and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. The principal products included in the Medical Devices segment are: \u2022rhythm management products, including Assurity MRI\u00ae and Endurity MRI\u00ae pacemaker systems, and Aveir\u00ae VR single-chamber VR leadless pacemaker system; Ellipse\u00ae, Fortify Assura\u00ae, and Gallant\u00ae implantable cardioverter defibrillators and Gallant and Quadra Assura MP\u00ae implantable cardioverter defibrillator with cardiac resynchronization therapy and MultiPoint\u2122 Pacing technology; and Confirm Rx\u00ae and Jot Dx\u00ae implantable cardiac monitors; \u2022electrophysiology products, including the TactiFlex\u2122 and TactiCath\u00ae families of ablation catheters, and FlexAbility\u00ae irrigated ablation catheters; EnSite\u00ae family of cardiac mapping systems; Agilis\u00ae NxT and Swartz\u2122 introducer catheters; the Advisor\u00ae HD Grid mapping catheter; and ViewFlex\u2122 family of intracardiac echocardiography catheters; \u2022heart failure related products, including the HeartMate\u00ae left ventricular assist device family, the CardioMEMS\u00ae HF System pulmonary artery sensor, a heart failure monitoring system, and the CentriMag\u00ae System, an acute mechanical circulatory support system; \u2022vascular products, including the XIENCE\u00ae family of drug-eluting coronary stent systems developed on the Multi-Link Vision\u00ae platform; StarClose SE\u00ae, Perclose ProGlide\u00ae and Perclose ProStyle\u00ae vessel closure devices, TREK\u00ae coronary balloon dilatation products, Hi-Torque Balance Middleweight Universal II\u00ae guidewires, Supera\u00ae Peripheral Stent System, a peripheral vascular stent system; Acculink\u00ae/Accunet\u00ae and Xact\u00ae/Emboshield NAV6\u00ae, carotid stent systems; the OPTIS\u00ae integrated systems with Ultreon\u2122 1.0 Software, compatible with the Dragonfly OPTIS\u00ae imaging catheter and PressureWire\u00ae fractional flow reserve measurement systems; and the JETi\u00ae peripheral thrombectomy systems for clot removal; \u2022structural heart products, including MitraClip\u00ae, a mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system; TriClip\u00ae, a tricuspid valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system; Epic\u00ae, a surgical family of aortic valve and mitral valve replacement devices; Portico\u00ae and Navitor\u2122 transcatheter aortic heart valves; Regent\u2122 and Masters Series\u2122 mechanical heart valves; Amplatzer\u00ae PFO occluders; Amplatzer Amulet\u00ae occluder devices; and the Tendyne\u00ae transcatheter mitral valve replacement system;  \u2022continuous glucose and blood glucose monitoring systems under the FreeStyle\u00ae brand such as the FreeStyle Libre\u00ae system, including sensors, data management decision software, test strips, and accessories for people with diabetes; and \u2022neuromodulation products, including spinal cord stimulators Proclaim\u00ae Elite and Proclaim\u00ae XR Recharge-free implantable pulse generators (IPG) and Prodigy MRI\u00ae IPG, each with BurstDR\u00ae stimulation, and Proclaim\u00ae DRG IPG, a neurostimulation device designed for dorsal root ganglion therapy, for the treatment of chronic pain disorders; and the Infinity\u00ae Deep Brain Stimulation System with directional lead technology for the treatment of movement disorders. 3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents These products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT\u2019S BUSINESS IN GENERAL Sources and Availability of Raw Materials Abbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott\u2019s operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world. Due to disruptions to the global supply chain caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions such as inflationary pressures and labor shortages, Abbott has experienced availability issues with some materials and electronic components. To date, Abbott has been able to manage these challenges without significant supply disruptions or shortages for raw materials and supplies. A more detailed discussion on the global supply chain disruptions and its resulting impact on Abbott\u2019s business is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in the \"Financial Review\u201d section in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses Abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott\u2019s products in the United States and countries of interest to Abbott. Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 4. These, and various patents which expire during the period 2023 to 2043, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott\u2019s business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, or trademark is material in relation to Abbott\u2019s business as a whole. Seasonal Aspects, Customers, and Renegotiation There are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott\u2019s business. Abbott has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on Abbott. No material portion of Abbott\u2019s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government. Environmental Matters Abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal, state, and various other countries\u2019 environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott\u2019s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2022 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2023. Abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Human Capital The sustainability of Abbott\u2019s business depends on attracting, engaging and developing talented people with diverse backgrounds who share Abbott\u2019s mission to help people live their healthiest possible lives. Abbott provides its employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers, market competitive compensation and benefit programs, and the satisfaction of being part of a global company dedicated to improving health in more than 160 countries. As of December 31, 2022, Abbott employed approximately 115,000 people, 69% of whom were employed outside of the U.S. Women represented 47% of Abbott\u2019s U.S. workforce, 46% of its global workforce, and 41% of its managers. 4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents Talent Management Abbott has an integrated global talent management process that is designed to identify and assess talent across the organization and provide equal and consistent opportunities for employees to develop their skills. All levels of employees participate in Abbott\u2019s annual performance management process to create development plans that support their particular career objectives, and Abbott provides a broad range of training, mentoring and other development opportunities to help its employees meet these objectives. The board of directors conducts an annual Talent Management Review, focusing on development of talent, diversity, and succession planning for critical positions. Similar reviews take place across Abbott to develop talent and diversity across the organization.  Diversity and Inclusion  Abbott is committed to developing a workplace that is inclusive for all. Abbott ties executive compensation to human capital management, including diversity outcomes, to sustain an inclusive culture and the fair and balanced treatment of Abbott\u2019s employees. In 2022, Abbott released the second edition of its diversity, equity, and inclusion report, providing an update on Abbott\u2019s plans, strategies, and actions to fulfill its commitment to develop an inclusive workplace.  Abbott\u2019s employee networks play an important role in building an inclusive culture across all Abbott operations. A corporate officer serves as a sponsor for each of these networks, helping to align their objectives with Abbott\u2019s business strategies. Abbott has ten such networks, which are: Early Career Network (supporting early career employees), Asian Leadership and Cultural Network, Black Business Network, Flex Network (supporting employees with part-time and flexible schedules), LA VOICE Network (supporting Hispanic and Latino employees), disABILITY Network (supporting employees with disabilities), PRIDE (supporting LGBTQ employees), Veterans Network, Women Leaders of Abbott, and Women in STEM. All networks are open to all Abbott employees. Abbott offers professional development programs, which provide recent college graduates the opportunity to rotate through different areas of Abbott, often with the chance to work outside their home country. In 2022, 53% of the participants were women. Also, Abbott hosts hundreds of college students for paid internships. In 2022, 58% of the U.S. interns were women and 59% were minorities. Further, Abbott has offered a STEM internship program for high school students in the U.S. since 2012 and since 2021, students who complete the program receive a college credit recommendation from the American Council on Education. The program\u2019s objective is to increase the number of students pursuing STEM-related careers and contribute to a more diverse talent pipeline for Abbott. In 2022, 69% of the STEM interns were women and 78% were minorities. Health and Safety The health, safety and wellness of its employees is an Abbott priority embedded at every level of its business. Abbott\u2019s integrated Environmental, Health and Safety organization governs health, safety and wellness at Abbott\u2019s facilities. Abbott also maintains global policies and standards for managing employee health and safety. Abbott takes a holistic approach to employee well-being. Abbott\u2019s global wellness programs are designed to meet the unique needs of employees across businesses and geographies and offer a wide range of programs, including supporting the mental, financial and physical health of employees and their families. For example, for over 20 years, Abbott has annually offered Exercise Across Abbott, which is a four-week physical wellness program that encourages employees to team up with colleagues and track how many minutes they exercise each day. Over 21,000 Abbott employees across 74 countries took part in 2022. Compensation and Benefits Abbott is committed to building, retaining, and motivating a diverse talent pipeline that can meet the current and future needs of its businesses. To that end, Abbott provides market competitive compensation, healthcare benefits, continuing education benefits, pension and/or retirement savings plans, financial support for employees with student loan debt, and several programs to facilitate employees building an ownership stake in Abbott, including a global long-term incentive program for employees generally beginning at the manager level. Abbott also has procedures and processes focused on ensuring employees receive equitable compensation, regardless of race or gender or other personal characteristics. 5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Regulation The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott\u2019s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott\u2019s products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott\u2019s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many pandemic-related products (including diagnostic tests) were authorized by regulators for emergency use solely during the pandemic. In addition, many governments enacted policies to expedite or promote access to health care in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus. Examples include expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing. On January 30, 2023, the U.S. announced that it plans to end the public health emergency on May 11, 2023. Abbott is evaluating the potential impacts of the end of the public health emergency, and it will continue to monitor further regulatory actions from relevant U.S. government agencies and assess potential impacts on pandemic-related government policies and product authorizations. Abbott\u2019s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott\u2019s investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products. Abbott\u2019s laboratory facilities, home monitoring services, and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to third-party payors. In the United States, Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria. Abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott\u2019s business. Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Devices Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product\u2019s production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties. Abbott\u2019s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. 6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products. Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, or coverage limitations. Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott\u2019s products for the foreseeable future. In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices, diagnostics, supplies, and other products, as well as the procedures in which these products may be used. The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time. For example, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies. Additionally, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act established a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests in 2018. Governmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott\u2019s nutritional products business. In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula. As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. In October 2018, the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required, beginning with reports filed in 2022. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. Policy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems. In the United States, this could include potential modification, including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act. The regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information, financial information and other sensitive personal information), is increasing. For example, the European Union, China, various other countries, and various U.S. states (e.g., California, Virginia, and Colorado) have enacted data protection laws that contain significant compliance obligations and financial penalties for noncompliance. In addition, regulators with general consumer protection authority, such as the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. states Attorneys General, are focused on how consumer data is used by entities in the health care industry. Further, there are regulations of data privacy and security that are specific to health care companies. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering \u201cdata localization\u201d laws, which limit companies\u2019 ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties. Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area.  Abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture, quality assurance requirements, marketing authorization processes, post-market surveillance requirements, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security. Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market, access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. 7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents INTERNET INFORMATION Copies of Abbott\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through Abbott\u2019s investor relations website (www.abbottinvestor.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after Abbott electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission).
