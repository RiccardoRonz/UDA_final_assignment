{"cik": 1781335, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01. Business  Our Company  Otis is the world\u2019s leading elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. We serve customers in over 200 countries and territories around the world. Otis has global scale and local focus, with over 1,400 branches and offices, and a direct physical presence in approximately 80 countries.   Separation from United Technologies Corporation  Otis is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated on March 1, 2019 in connection with the separation and distribution (\"Separation\") of each of Otis and Carrier Global Corporation (\"Carrier\") from United Technologies Corporation, subsequently renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation (\"UTC\" or \"RTX\", as applicable) into separate independent publicly-traded companies. The Separation occurred on April 3, 2020. References to \"UTC\" relate to pre-Separation matters, and references to \"RTX\" relate to post-Separation matters.  The Separation was completed pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement (\"Separation Agreement\") and other agreements with UTC and Carrier related to the Separation, including but not limited to a transition services agreement (\"TSA\"), a tax matters agreement (\"TMA\"), an employee matter agreement (\"EMA\") and an intellectual property agreement (the \"Intellectual Property Agreement\"). For further discussion of these agreements, see Item 1A, \"Note 1: Business Overview\" in Item 8 and Item 15 in this Form 10-K.  The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with Item 7 in this Form 10-K, including the information contained therein under the heading \"Business Overview.\"   Description of Business by Segment  Our Company is organized into two segments, New Equipment and Service, which, for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, contributed 43% and 57% of our net sales, and 17% and 83% of our segment operating profit, respectively. Our international operations represented approximately 72% of our net sales for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022.  New Equipment  Through our New Equipment segment, we design, manufacture, sell and install a wide range of passenger and freight elevators, as well as escalators and moving walkways for residential, commercial and infrastructure projects. In 2022, our New Equipment segment had sales of $5.9 billion and operating profit of $358 million. In 2022, our New Equipment sales in China represented approximately one-third of our new equipment net sales and China represented over half of our global New Equipment unit volume.  We have developed a range of elevator and escalator solutions to meet the varying needs and objectives of our diverse customers. Our primary elevator and escalator solutions are described below.  4 4  4 Table of Contents Table of Contents The Gen2 family of elevators has been our principal low-and mid-rise elevator solution. Since its launch in 2000, Otis has sold over one million Gen2 units, making it our best selling elevator platform. In 2021, we introduced the successors to the Gen2 family of elevators: the Gen3 and Gen360 digital elevator platforms. These platforms enhance the space-saving, energy-efficient design of the Gen2 elevator with the connectivity of the Otis ONE IoT (internet of things) digital service platform, while offering additional safety features for passengers and our colleagues who maintain the elevator. Otis ONE is designed to continuously monitor equipment health and performance in real time to provide proactive, predictive and transparent information to our technicians and customers. The technology expands predictive and remote maintenance capabilities to support improved elevator up-time and service productivity.   The Gen360 elevator also features a new native electronic architecture, with many mechanical components replaced by electronic components that in connection with our service increase reliability, reduce the potential for entrapments and free hoistway space to accommodate larger cabins. The Otis ONE IoT solution adds a network of sensors for real-time status updates. A foldable, in-ceiling platform allows maintenance operations to be performed safely from within the car rather than on top of it and, depending on local regulations, eliminates the need for a refuge space above the car and the protrusion on the roof allowing for a flat roof design. With 360-degree cameras in the hoistway, Otis service teams can visually confirm, fine-tune, diagnose and solve many issues remotely without stopping the elevator.  For taller, high-rise buildings, our most prominent product is the SkyRise elevator solution. The SkyRise advanced high-rise elevator platform combines cutting-edge technologies and precision engineering to deliver solutions for residential, commercial and mixed use skyscrapers.  Otis offers a range of technologies for improving the passenger experience. Our proprietary Compass 360 destination management system groups passengers by their desired destination and directs them to an assigned car that minimizes waiting and ride time. The system's algorithms anticipate traffic demand within a building and improve traffic flow. Otis eView in-car display streams live, customizable infotainment to passengers and can connect them to OTISLINE, Otis' 24-hour service call center, during an emergency. The Otis eCall Plus smartphone app enables passengers to summon their elevator remotely for a touchless experience. We previously rolled out new voice and gesturing technologies for summoning elevators to customers in China and North America, with other geographies to follow.  In addition to elevator solutions, we also offer escalators and moving walkways. With a range of finishes and aesthetics, Otis escalators integrate easily with building designs. Our smart design and features enhance sustainability and passenger safety, such as sensor-equipped escalators and moving walkways that efficiently run only when passengers approach, or operate at reduced speeds to conserve energy when there are no riders.   Our New Equipment customers include real-estate and building developers and general contractors who develop and/or design buildings for residential, commercial, retail or mixed-use activity. We also sell New Equipment to government agencies, particularly, to support infrastructure projects, such as airports, railways or metros. We generally sell directly to our customers through our New Equipment sales personnel. Due to the nature of the customer base in China and certain other geographies, our direct sales force is augmented by agents and distributors. Given the breadth of our customer base and the large number of customers to whom we deliver new equipment on an annual basis, we are not dependent on any single customer and do not have any contracts material to Otis as a whole with any single customer. The same is true for our broad and geographically dispersed network of agents and distributors.  New Equipment customers typically engage with us at an early stage during the construction cycle. The timing of order placement depends on factors including project complexity and customer requirements. Elevator installation usually occurs midway through building construction.  New Equipment orders are generally delivered within 12 months of booking, though larger projects can take longer to deliver based on customer construction schedules, and in some regions, mostly in China, the order to delivery window is shorter. When placing New Equipment orders, customers typically make an advance payment to cover costs including design and contract engineering. These advance payments are typically followed by periodic progress payments at specified milestones, such as delivery of materials at the job site and completion of installation and equipment commissioning. Installation is carried out by our installation technicians or through subcontractors, in which case we typically complete the final inspection and commissioning to ensure that our quality standards are met. Revenues are recognized based on percentage of completion. Once commissioned, New Equipment units are typically supported by a warranty for a limited period of time.   5 5  5 Table of Contents Table of Contents Service  Through our Service segment, we perform maintenance and repair services, as well as modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators. We have a maintenance portfolio of approximately 2.2 million units globally, which includes Otis equipment manufactured and sold by us, as well as equipment from other original equipment manufacturers. Through our network of service sales personnel, we sell our services directly to customers in all significant elevator and escalator end-segments around the world. In 2022, our Service segment had net sales of $7.8 billion and operating profit of $1.8 billion.   Service customers typically comprise building owners, facility managers, housing associations and government agencies that operate buildings where elevators and escalators are installed. Customers securing services for elevators are frequently different from those who initially make purchasing decisions with respect to New Equipment solutions. As the largest service provider in the industry worldwide, we have a wide range of customers in our Service segment and do not have any single service contract material to Otis as a whole. Contract duration depends on a number of factors, including customer needs, regulatory requirements and industry/geography dynamics. We work closely with our customers to renew these contracts as appropriate. Certain types of customers, such as those owning or operating large properties or portfolios of properties, tend to execute long-term maintenance agreements.  We seek to grow our maintenance portfolio through conversion of newly installed units into maintenance contracts, through prospecting and winning units already in service from customers using another service provider and through acquisitions. Our Service sales personnel seek to win service contracts upon the expiration or termination of existing service contracts from customers by offering a superior value proposition through service excellence, an engaged and technically sophisticated group of field service technicians, a streamlined customer experience and strong elevator and escalator operating performance.  Our services include inspections, preventive maintenance offerings and other customized maintenance offerings tailored to meet customer needs. A basic maintenance contract provides for inspection consistent with local regulatory needs. We offer incremental, tiered maintenance and service offerings, with varying levels of coverage up to and including comprehensive component replacement coverage. We also provide customers with repair services to address equipment and component wear and tear, as well as breakdowns.   Similar to most other electro-mechanical equipment, elevators and escalators are subject to wear and tear, which over time erodes equipment functionality. As elevator equipment ages, we work with customers to help renew or refresh their elevators with modernization solutions that enhance equipment operation, improve building functionality and contribute to more sustainable building systems. Modernization offerings can range from relatively simple upgrades of interior finishes and aesthetics to complex upgrades of larger components and sub-systems.   We provide our Service offerings to our customers through a global network of approximately 34,000 Service mechanics operating out of over 1,400 branches and offices typically located in close proximity to concentrations of customers. Our mechanics are critical to our ability to deliver a high level of service to our customers. Our OTISLINE operations provide personalized customer support 24/7. They receive customer service requests and assign and dispatch field technicians, as necessary, to respond to service requests. Our network of service parts centers, repair centers, and obsolescence management capabilities are key enablers to supporting customers by keeping their elevators and escalators in good working condition.   Digital Technology initiatives  Otis has been using technology to monitor elevator performance remotely for decades, culminating in our latest Otis ONE technology discussed under \"New Equipment\" above. We also offer multimedia subscription options with additional voice, data and video digital services to customers leveraging our IoT technologies. As of the end of 2022, approximately 800,000 units of our global portfolio, including units under the warranty period, are connected. In 2023, we expect to continue to innovate and expand our digital ecosystem and suite of digital solutions for both our existing service portfolio customers and for new equipment shipments from our factories.  6 6  6  Table of Contents Table of Contents Research and Development & Intellectual Property  Innovation is a fundamental characteristic of our history and is central to our strategy. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, research and development (\"R&D\") expense was $150 million and 1.1% as a percentage of net sales. In addition to R&D expense, we made investments in digital and strategic initiatives of approximately $55 million, which in combination with R&D expense was 1.5% as a percentage of net sales. We coordinate our R&D efforts globally through an operating model that sets global and local priorities based on customer and segment needs. We have 11 R&D centers and 17 factories around the world, including major locations in China, India, France, Spain and the United States. The R&D centers are strategically located close to concentrations of customers and factories to enable efficient development of engineering solutions that can serve as global model products and adapt quickly and efficiently to local customer needs and local demographic and construction trends. We have approximately 1,200 engineers globally, with increasing focus on digital initiatives, software, design of the user interface and the user experience.   We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to the Otis business to protect our R&D investments in products and services. We currently own approximately 4,200 globally issued patents, and we have approximately 2,300 patent applications pending globally. We filed approximately 1,300 patent applications in the last three years. Our patents are primarily filed in Europe, the United States and Asia. We believe that our patents and trade secrets create a competitive advantage and that we have taken reasonable measures to build a portfolio of valid and enforceable intellectual property rights. However, these intellectual property rights might be challenged and could be found invalid or unenforceable. Loss of strategic patents and trade secrets could significantly affect our competitiveness. See Item 1A in this Form 10-K for further discussion of intellectual property matters.   Joint Ventures and Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries  Our international strategic relationships, joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries are an important part of our business as they support our access to international markets and customers. Results of these entities are consolidated with our financial and operational results. In addition to China, as discussed below, we also operate through joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries in certain other countries. As discussed further below, we acquired the remaining interest in Zardoya Otis during 2022.   China  We operate in China through two principal joint ventures: Otis Elevator (China) Investment Company Limited (\u201cOtis China\u201d) and Otis Electric Elevator Company Limited (\u201cOtis Electric\u201d). Otis China is a joint venture established in 1998 for the purpose of manufacturing, installing and servicing elevators, escalators and related equipment. We are a majority owner of Otis China, and Tianjin Tai Kang Investment Co. Ltd. is our joint venture partner. Otis Electric, a subsidiary of Otis China, is a joint venture established in 1997 for the purpose of manufacturing, installing and servicing elevators, escalators and related equipment. Otis China owns a controlling equity stake in Otis Electric. Otis China\u2019s partner in Otis Electric is Xizi Elevator Group Co.   Otis Mobility (formerly Zardoya Otis)  We conduct our operations based in Spain through Otis Mobility S.A. (\"Otis Mobility\", formerly Zardoya Otis S.A. (\u201cZardoya Otis\u201d)). Otis Mobility manufactures, installs and services elevators and elevator equipment in Spain, and exports elevator equipment it manufactures for installation by certain of our subsidiaries outside of Spain.   In September 2021, the Company announced its tender offer (the \"Tender Offer\") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Zardoya Otis not owned by the Company. Prior to completion of the Tender Offer, Zardoya Otis\u2019 shares were listed on Spanish stock exchanges, and the company was subject to the supervision of the Spanish Securities Exchange Commission (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Mercado de Valores (the \"CNMV\")). We owned a majority equity stake in Zardoya Otis, with Euro Syns S.A. owning a minority position and the remaining shares being held by public shareholders.  As a result of the Tender Offer, the Company acquired the remaining issued and outstanding shares of Zardoya Otis not owned by the Company in exchange for cash during April and May 2022. As a result, the Company owns 100% of Zardoya Otis. Zardoya Otis shares were automatically delisted on May 9, 2022 and has been renamed Otis Mobility. See \"Note 1: Business Overview\" for further details regarding this transaction.  7 7  7 Table of Contents Table of Contents    Competition   We operate in a global and highly competitive industry. Due to the global and localized nature of the industry, there are numerous participants of varying size that operate in our industry. According to industry estimates, there are hundreds of participants that offer New Equipment solutions and several thousand participants that offer maintenance and service solutions. In both the New Equipment and Service segments, major competitors globally include KONE Oyj, Schindler Group and TK Elevator, while there are a number of additional competitors in the Asia Pacific region. Competitive dynamics vary significantly by segment and geography. In the Service segment, independent service providers and other small operators are significant competitors in most of our local geographies. These independent service providers have an aggregate portfolio of about 50% of service units, but account for a smaller percentage of the service business when measured by value because of the types of units and level of maintenance covered by these providers.   There are several factors that determine competitiveness in the industry, including local codes and compliance requirements, customer preferences, price, reputation, delivery and execution, product quality, equipment performance, reliability and long-term service and product support. Our success in both our New Equipment and Service segments depends upon our ability to develop and market our products, services and solutions, as well as our ability to provide the people, technologies, facilities, equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency. We believe our global presence, local relationships and proven track record in executing complex elevator and escalator solutions contribute to our iconic brand, reputation and competitive position in the industry. We believe our business strategies allow us to sustain New Equipment growth, accelerate Service portfolio growth, advance the digitalization of Otis, focus and empower the organization, support our ability to successfully compete across the New Equipment and Service segments, and will help deliver sustainable earnings growth.   Compliance with Government Regulations   We conduct our business through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. Any changes in legislation or government policies impacting our industry, including with respect to employee safety, labor-related regulations, industrial equipment, licensing requirements, foreign ownership limitations and building and elevator safety codes, can affect our operations. We closely monitor local legislation and government policies in the locations in which we operate.  In addition, our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulations promulgated by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes and regulations for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition.  U.S. laws, regulations, orders, and other measures concerning the export or re-export of products, software, services and technology to, and other trade-related activities involving, non-U.S. countries and parties affect the operations of Otis and its affiliates, as do those of other countries pertaining to similar matters.  For further discussion of risks related to environmental matters and other government regulations, see in this Form 10-K Item 1A, Item 7 and \"Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and \"Note 22: Contingent Liabilities\" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K.   Seasonality  Our business and operating results are generally not subject to significant fluctuations as a result of seasonality, although we have experienced lower New Equipment sales in Asia in the first calendar quarter, coinciding with Lunar New Year celebrations. In addition, we have also experienced lower New Equipment sales in the fourth quarter in China, due to a national holiday that occurs during the first week of October which may impact the relative mix of sales within the quarter.  8 8  8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Raw Materials and Supplies  Due to the global and distributed nature of our operations, we partner with a diverse network of several thousand suppliers globally. These include product and non-product suppliers, as well as subcontractors. We rely on approximately 500 key suppliers for our manufacturing supply chain.   Components and systems necessary to effectively complete our New Equipment projects, as well as to satisfy our maintenance and repair obligations, are often available from two or more sources within the industry. While we believe no single supplier is material to our business, some components or applications require particular specifications or qualifications. In those cases, there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components, which have in the past, and could in the future, result in supply constraints or cost pressures due to an issue with such a supplier, including financial or operational difficulties or a contract dispute. Additionally, the slowdown of economic activity due to coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") and subsequent unsettled recovery in certain regions, including their impact on employment, have created long lead times and product shortages for certain components and suppliers. We implement mitigation actions to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain, including the use of safety stock and alternative materials, as well as risk assessments, qualification of multiple supply sources and use of long-term supplier agreements.   Although at times high prices for some important raw materials have caused margin and cost pressures for our business, including in connection with the impact of COVID-19-and the uncertain recovery, we do not expect near-term unavailability or pricing of materials, components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our business. We seek to manage commodity price risk through locking and hedging strategies, as well as passing the increases onto our customers through pricing. See Item 1A in this Form 10-K for risks associated with raw material and supply chain, as well as COVID-19.   Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")  ESG is part of our culture and embedded in our long-term strategy. The principles of ESG align with the foundation of our business: our Absolutes of Safety, Ethics, and Quality. We are committed to the health and safety of our colleagues and the riding public. We strive to reduce the environmental impact of our own products, operations and services and those of our customers. We foster a culture that embraces all voices and diverse points of view and proactively engages in the communities we serve. See \"Human Capital\" below for additional information regarding certain ESG initiatives related to our colleagues, including health and safety, employee engagement and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (\"DE&I\").   In 2021, we became a signatory to the U.N. Global Compact and published our thirteen ESG goals (including the four Environment & Impact goals below) aligned with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (\"SDGs\"). Our ESG goals and alignment to SDGs are categorized into four areas: Health & Safety, Environment & Impact, People & Communities and Governance & Accountability. Our ESG goals can be found in the Investor section of our corporate website, where we make updates from time to time.  We set goals within each of these areas and aligned to the U.N. SDGs on which we can have the greatest impact. Our Environment & Impact goals are as follows:  \u2022Achieve a 50% reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030  \u2022Reach carbon neutrality for factory electricity by 2030  \u2022Achieve 100% factory eligibility for zero-waste-to-landfill certification by 2025  \u2022Complete ISO 14001 certification for all factories by 2025 (goal completed in 2021)  In April 2022, we published our inaugural ESG report on our ESG activities, metrics and progress towards our goals in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative Standards, as well as in alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board guidelines and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Our progress towards reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gases is included as a performance multiplier in determining payouts under our executive short-term incentive plan. Our ESG goals and ESG report are available through the Investors section of our website (http://www.otis.com) under the heading \"ESG\". Our ESG goals, our ESG report and our corporate website are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.  9 9  9 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our Board of Directors and its committees engage in extensive review and oversight of ESG-related topics. The Company's ESG Council monitors our performance towards our ESG goals. The ESG Council is composed of senior leaders representing multiple functions within the Company, including Communications, Engineering, Human Resources, Investor Relations, Legal, and Operations (Environmental, Health & Safety, Supply Chain and Quality & Continuous Improvement). Also, an internal ESG Working Group, comprised of subject matter experts assists the ESG Council in developing and effectuating the Company's ESG strategy. Both the ESG Council and ESG Working Group meet frequently, with the ESG Council reporting regularly to our CEO and the Executive Leadership Team on our ESG progress and actions.  There have been no, and we do not expect there to be in the near term, material impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations as a result of compliance with legislation or regulatory rules regarding climate change, from the known physical effects of climate change or as a result of implementing our ESG initiatives. Increased regulation (including the pending Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and European Union requirements) and other climate change concerns, however, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, and we are not able to predict how such regulations or concerns would affect our business, operations or financial results. For a discussion of risks associated with ESG matters, see Item 1A in this Form 10-K.   Human Capital  As of December\u00a031, 2022, our global workforce consists of approximately 69,000 colleagues, with 44% in Asia, 33% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d) and 23% in the Americas.  Approximately 64% of our workforce in the U.S. is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Outside of the U.S., our colleagues are represented by workers' councils or statutory labor unions as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions. While we strive to maintain good relationships with our employee representative bodies, our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force. The collective bargaining agreement for most of our bargaining unit colleagues in the U.S. was renewed without disruption in July 2022 and is set to expire in July 2027. For a discussion of risks associated with employment-related matters, see Item 1A in this Form 10-K.  Compensation  Our colleagues are vital to our success, and we offer pay and benefits designed to attract, retain and motivate our colleagues and align their compensation with both individual and our overall performance. While our programs vary by location and eligibility, they include base pay, short-term incentive bonuses, long-term incentive pay in the form of stock awards, retirement plans, health care and insurance benefits, tuition assistance through our Employee Scholar program, paid sick, bereavement, vacation, parental and family leaves, wellness and employee assistance programs.  Safety and Health  Safety is one of the Otis Absolutes. For that reason, safety measures and indicators are regularly monitored by management and reported to our Board of Directors. To promote safety, we have a health and safety management system and regularly measure the effectiveness of our health and safety programs. We empower all of our colleagues and subcontractors with stop work authority if they perceive an unsafe condition or a behavior that may cause injury. We also seek to promote a culture where stop work authority can be freely exercised without the fear of retribution or retaliation, and a learning culture to enhance the quality and delivery of safety and technical training. Health and Safety is one of the four focus areas of our ESG goals. See the \u201cEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")\u201d section of this Form 10-K above for more information regarding our ESG goals.  For our colleagues to be effective, they need to be healthy. Starting in 2020, with the added stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased our efforts to improve our colleagues\u2019 mental health by expanding employee assistance plan benefits and by bringing increased attention to the importance of mental health. We now provide employee assistance plan benefits to all of our colleagues worldwide. We also offer flexible work arrangements to many salaried colleagues.  Training and Development  We strive to emphasize development and training, as we believe that individual and corporate success is driven by lifelong learning and by empowering our colleagues. As a result, we provide a range of development and mentoring opportunities that vary based on a colleague's career stage and function. One of our flagship programs is \u201cOtis University,\u201d a global program that builds leadership and functional capabilities in sales, field, engineering, operations, and major projects. Our \u201cEmployee Scholar  10 10  10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Program\u201d is a comprehensive, company-sponsored education program that allows colleagues to expand their skills through degree or certification programs.  Having access to trained technicians is very important to our business. Our mechanics receive extensive training to service and install equipment safely. This training consists of live, virtual, and on-the-job modules with experienced mechanics. We are increasing our professional network to reach out to more communities when hiring through partnerships, and have developed several apprenticeship, training and internship programs. We are also increasing through various initiatives the number of women in our mechanic population across the world to enhance diversity and to obtain access to a larger talent pool.  Commitment to Change  We aim to be both an equal-opportunity employer of choice for people of broad perspectives and experiences, cultures, genders, races, and generations, and whose workforce mirrors the diversity of our customers and the communities where we live and work, and a place where every voice feels safe, welcomed and heard. To further accountability and transparency with respect to our DE&I progress, we established a DE&I Advisory Group which is responsible for setting Otis DE&I global strategy and priorities. The DE&I Advisory Group is composed of eight members representing cross-functional and cross-regional areas and one Otis Board member, and includes four annual rotating members and four permanent members, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief People Officer. Our DE&I performance is reviewed by our DE&I Advisory Group three times a year.   In addition, we believe that it is important for us to significantly increase the number of women we have in executive roles. In 2020, we joined the Paradigm for Parity coalition, pledging our commitment to establish gender parity across our executive leadership by 2030. Our progress towards attaining gender parity across our executive leadership is a performance multiplier in determining payouts under our executive short-term incentive plan.  Our global inclusive leadership learning program provides training through virtual learning and group conversations to identify and mitigate bias using a common approach and vocabulary. In 2022, we implemented a gender identity policy and deployed a self-ID campaign, which allows employees to self-report their demographic data. We also launched an initiative, We Are Many Voices, as part of global inclusion month in October 2022. During that month, all colleagues were encouraged to celebrate and learn about the different dimensions of diversity, engage with each other, and grow stronger together.   Our employee resource groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) also play a significant role in our ability to attract, retain, and develop diverse talent, and build allies across the organization. As ERGs are vital in nurturing a culture of DE&I at Otis, we are continuing to expand our ERG offerings by supporting all abilities and increasing representation, and are partnering with them to further our DE&I initiatives.    Engagement  We believe that engaged colleagues deliver better service to our customers. We measure engagement by conducting colleague surveys twice yearly. The results, which are reported to our Board of Directors and management, help us assess how our colleagues feel about working for us. We use the survey results to develop action plans to address areas of concern. The engagement surveys, which anonymizes the data, cover topics such as safety, ethics, belonging, quality, company prospects, inclusion, empowerment, accountability and managerial effectiveness. Increasing colleague favorability for the inclusive culture category in the Company\u2019s engagement survey is part of our thirteen published ESG goals. See the \u201cEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")\u201d section of this Form 10-K above for more information regarding our ESG goals.
