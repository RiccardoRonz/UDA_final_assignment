This focus on quality includes a commitment to excellence in manufacturing, scientific and technical expertise and management, which enables us to partner with our customers in order to deliver safe, effective drug products to patients quickly and efficiently.   Business Segments  Our business operations are organized into two global business segments, Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products.  Proprietary Products Segment  Our Proprietary Products reportable segment offers proprietary packaging, containment solutions and drug delivery systems, along with analytical lab services and other integrated services and solutions, primarily to biologic, generic and pharmaceutical drug customers. Our packaging products include stoppers and seals for injectable packaging systems, which are designed to help ensure drug compatibility and stability with active drug products, while also supporting operational efficiency for customers. These packaging products also includes syringe and cartridge components, including custom solutions for the specific needs of injectable drug applications, as well as administration systems that can enhance the safe delivery of drugs through advanced reconstitution, mixing and transfer technologies. We also provide films, coatings, washing, vision inspection and sterilization processes and services to enhance the quality of our packaging products and mitigate the risk of contamination and compatibility issues.  This segment\u2019s product portfolio also includes drug containment solutions, including Crystal Zenith, a cyclic olefin polymer, in the form of vials, syringes and cartridges. These products can\u00a0provide a\u00a0high-quality solution to glass incompatibility issues and can stand up to cold storage environments, while reducing the risk of breakage that exists with glass. In addition, we offer a variety of self-injection devices, designed to address the need to provide at-home delivery of injectable therapies. These devices are patient-centric technologies that are easy-to-use and can be combined with connected health technologies that have the potential to increase adherence.   In addition to our Proprietary Products product portfolio, we provide our customers with a range of integrated solutions, including analytical lab services, pre-approval primary packaging support and engineering development, regulatory expertise, and after-sales technical support. Offering the combination of primary proprietary packaging components, containment solutions, and drug delivery devices, as well as a broad range of integrated services, helps to position us as a leader in the integrated containment and delivery of injectable medicines.  This reportable segment has manufacturing facilities in North and South America, Europe, and Asia, with affiliated companies in Mexico and Japan. Please refer to Item 2, Properties, for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites.  4 4 4    Contract-Manufactured Products Segment  Our Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment serves as a fully integrated business, focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex devices, primarily for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers. These products include a variety of custom contract-manufacturing and assembly solutions, which use technologies such as multi-component molding, in-mold labeling, ultrasonic welding, clean room molding and device assembly. We manufacture customer-owned components and devices used in surgical, diagnostic, ophthalmic, injectable, and other drug delivery systems, as well as consumer products.  We have vast expertise in product design and development, including in-house mold design, process design and validation and high-speed automated assemblies.  This reportable segment has manufacturing operations in North America and Europe. Please refer to Item 2, Properties, for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites.  International  We have significant operations outside of the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d), which are managed through the same business segments as our U.S. operations \u2013 Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. Sales outside of the U.S. accounted for 55.4% of our net sales in 2022.  Although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business, international operations are exposed to additional risks. These risks include currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d), multiple tax jurisdictions and, particularly in South America, Eastern Europe, Israel, China and the Middle East, uncertain or changing regulatory regimes, or political and social issues, that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products.  See further discussion of our international operations, the risks associated with our international operations, and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors; Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources; Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk; Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the captions Financial Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation; and Note 11, Derivative Financial Instruments.  Raw Materials  We use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products: elastomers, aluminum and plastic. Elastomers include both synthetic and natural materials. We currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers. We are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements. In addition, some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders, which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption. We employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments, which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply. Due to regulatory control over our production processes, sole source availability, and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers, we rely on single-source suppliers for many critical raw materials. We generally purchase certain raw materials in the open market and therefore the results of our operations may be affected by price fluctuations. This strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production or distribution problem. These risks are managed, when and where possible, by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites, rigorous quality control systems, surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production or distribution. Heightened inflation may result in unfavorable conditions, inclusive of an increase in raw material cost. To date, we have been able to manage these conditions without significant disruption to our business.  5 5 5   While we work closely with our suppliers, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful, and there may be events that cause supply interruption, reduction or termination that adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain products. See further discussion of the risks related to the supply chain and raw materials in Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Intellectual Property  Our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, know-how and trade secrets, is important to our business. We own or license intellectual property rights, including know-how and issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries, that relate to various aspects of our business. In 2022, more than 150 patents were issued to West across the globe. Certain key value-added and proprietary products and processes are exclusively licensed from Daikyo. We believe, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole, or to any business segment.  Government Regulation  Our business activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations to healthcare, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, anti-corruption, export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, privacy and other areas. The design, development, manufacturing, marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers\u2019 products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., Europe and other countries, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), the European Medicines Agency and the National Medical Products Administration (China). Regulatory authorities, including regulatory review and oversight, can impact the time and cost associated with the development and continued availability of our products, and they have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against West.  Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations did not require material capital expenditures in 2022, and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position in 2023 as compared to prior periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\". There were no required material capital expenditures for adherence to our government-led regulatory standards in our facilities in 2022 outside the normal course of business, and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2023.  West is also subject to various federal and state laws, and laws outside the United States, concerning fraud and abuse, global anti-corruption, and export control. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement actions with respect to healthcare manufacturers in recent years. We remain committed as a company to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to our business.   Environmental Regulations  We are subject to various national, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There were no required material capital expenditures for environmental controls in our facilities in 2022 and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2023.  Marketing  Our Proprietary Products customers primarily include many of the major biologic, generic, and pharmaceutical drug companies in the world, which incorporate our components and other offerings into their injectable products for distribution to the point of care and ultimate end-user, the patient. Our Contract-Manufactured Products customers include many of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies.  6 6 6   Contract-Manufactured Products components generally are incorporated into our customers\u2019 manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly. Our products and services are sold and distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network, with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors.   Our ten largest customers accounted for 45.6% of our consolidated net sales in 2022, but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales. Please refer to Note 3, Revenue, and Note 19, Segment Information, for additional information on our consolidated net sales.  Competition  With our range of proprietary technologies, we compete with several companies across our Proprietary Products product lines. Competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance, quality, regulatory compliance, and scientific expertise, along with total cost.  In addition, there are a number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components, including a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers who are also potential customers of our medical devices and components. We compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management, as well as our knowledge of, and experience in, compliance with regulatory requirements.  We have specialized knowledge of container closure components, which is integral to developing delivery systems. With our range of proprietary technologies, we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices, including suppliers of prefillable syringes, auto-injectors, safety needles, and other proprietary systems.  We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition by serving as a global supplier of integrated drug containment and delivery systems that can provide pre-approval primary packaging support and engineering development, analytical lab services and integrated solutions, regulatory expertise, and after-sale technical support. Customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites.  Our Contract-Manufactured Products business operates in very competitive markets for its products. The competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global assembly manufacturers. Given the cost pressures they face, many of our customers look to reduce costs by sourcing from low-cost locations. We seek to differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capabilities and by employing new technologies such as high-speed automated assembly, insert-molding, multi-shot precision molding, and expertise with multiple-piece closure systems.  Research and Development Activities  We maintain our own research-scale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development. Our quality control, regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and delivery systems. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology.   Commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years. New products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices, and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer\u2019s products following our development period.  We continue to pursue strategic initiatives in drug containment components, drug containment systems, novel drug delivery devices, safety and administration systems.  7 7 7   We also continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition, licensing, partnering or development of products, services and technologies.  Cybersecurity Governance  Our approach to cybersecurity begins with our responsibility for strong governance and controls. Security begins at the top of our organization, where Company leadership consistently communicates the requirements for vigilance and compliance throughout the organization, and then leads by example. The cybersecurity program is led by our Digital and Transformation team, who provide quarterly updates to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, annual updates to the Board of Directors, and regular reports to the West Leadership Team about the program, including information about cyber risk management governance and the status of ongoing efforts to strengthen cybersecurity effectiveness. Security controls and processes are developed and maintained to protect sensitive and confidential information while ensuring availability and integrity.   We also educate and share best practices globally with our employees to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats. As part of our onboarding process, we train all new employees on cybersecurity and maintain an annual retraining for all employees on cybersecurity standards, as well as how to recognize and properly respond to phishing and social engineering schemes. We have deployed a phishing detection system to report suspicious emails, which are flagged for further review, as well as an automated monthly process to retrain employees who do not maintain an acceptable pass rate on our phishing recognition training. Our cybersecurity defenses also utilize technologies such as next generation firewalls, Zero Trust Network Access intrusion detection and prevention measures, security information and event management, anti-malware, advance threat protection, multifactor authentication, network segmentation and encryption to ensure the privacy and security of our customers\u2019 data. We also have a dedicated Security Operations Center, monitoring our applications and infrastructure on a 24-by-7 basis which is integrated with our enterprise crisis management framework. To round out our awareness program, we have specific and regular training for our Digital and Transformation professionals.  Human Capital Management  Our People  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we employed approximately 10,700 people, excluding contractors and temporary workers, in our operations throughout the world. During 2022, West hired approximately 2,850 new team members and experienced an attrition rate of approximately 22%.

West\u2019s Code of Conduct, available in multiple languages on westpharma.com, provides guidance to our team members on appropriate and ethical conduct. Every team member is required to undergo Code of Conduct and mutual respect in the workplace training annually.   Our focus on talent acquisition, performance management, resource planning and leadership assessment are strongly aligned with our diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. We understand that diversity leads to greater innovation, more opportunities, better access to talent and stronger business performance.   Compensation and Benefits  West is committed to providing fair and competitive compensation and benefits programs to attract, retain and reward high-performing team members at all levels. We offer a comprehensive total rewards program to support the health, financial and home-life needs of our team members. Total Rewards at West are defined as the value of the Compensation and Benefits programs offered to employees, which aim to reflect the value of the job and the contribution of the individual, while linking employees\u2019 performance to business and personal results. Based on country of employment, West may provide health care and retirement savings programs as well as paid time off, flexible work schedules, a Global Employee Assistance Program and an Employee Stock Purchase Program.   Health, Safety and Wellness   The health and safety of our team members has always been both a top priority and a cultural value. West's commitment to the safety of our teams starts at the top and is driven throughout our business by every level of management and by every team member across the globe. West has a Health, Safety, and Environment (\"HSE\") Executive Council consisting of C-suite and executive operations leaders to monitor and guide our HSE process. West\u2019s global HSE team is also a critical component in leading the safety efforts at our sites. Each manufacturing location has dedicated and trained HSE professionals, responsible for general safety oversight at the site. Our Recordable Injury Rate in 2022 was 0.67 per 100 employees. Our HSE and employee well-being focus can also be seen in our focus on quality implementation of Leading Indicator programs and metrics to drive Lagging Indicator performance.       9 9 9   Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) Commitment  West has been committed to ESG topics for many years. During 2022, we continued to increase internal and external awareness of our ESG commitment by expanding our education and communication regarding our ESG program and initiatives and more closely integrating ESG considerations into our business processes. Our ESG program includes a senior-level cross-functional ESG team which has been working with executive leadership, our board and other stakeholders to enhance our ESG framework and ensure alignment with our corporate mission, vision and values. Our long-term strategic priorities include focus on talent attraction, retention and engagement (including efforts to increase the diversity, equity and inclusivity of our workforce to reflect the communities in which we live and work); a climate and greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") reduction strategy that incorporates renewable energy and reduced absolute and intensity emissions; developing a more sustainable and responsible supply chain; research and development that focuses on issues of sustainability including secondary packaging, beneficial reuse and recyclability; and, reduction of waste and water in our operational processes. These areas of focus are in addition to our commitments to safety, quality, business continuity, as well as business compliance and integrity. Additionally, our philanthropic programs are an essential element of our corporate citizenship especially as we focus on the areas of children\u2019s health; access to healthcare; and science, technology, engineering and math education. We are also expanding our philanthropic scope to include more sustainability related initiatives. We solicit input from our employees on ways to improve in these and other ESG areas and see continued progress in these areas as critical to maintaining an engaged and responsible workforce.
