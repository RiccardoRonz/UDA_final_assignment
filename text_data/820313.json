The Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment primarily designed, manufactured and marketed a broad range of connector and connector systems, value-add products and other products, including antennas and sensors, used in a wide range of applications in a diverse set of end markets.  Interconnect products included connectors which, when attached to an electrical, electronic or fiber optic cable, a printed circuit board or other device, facilitate transmission of power or signals.  Value-add systems generally consisted of a system of cable, flexible circuits or printed circuit boards and connectors, antennas or sensors for linking electronic equipment.  The Cable Products and Solutions segment primarily designed, manufactured and marketed cable, value-add products and components for use primarily in the broadband communications and information technology markets, as well as certain applications in other markets.\u200bCOVID-19 Pandemic\u200bSince early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our offices and manufacturing facilities around the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers\u2019 contract manufacturers.  These disruptions have included, and may continue to include, government regulations that inhibit our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course, travel restrictions, supplier constraints, supply chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers.  During much of 2022, COVID-19 outbreaks in China resulted in local or regional government-imposed lockdowns and restrictions, which impacted the ability of several of our operations and manufacturing facilities to operate in the ordinary course.  As of December 31, 2022, there continue to be isolated COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions of the world, particularly in China, but these outbreaks have not had a significant impact on our operations.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2023 and beyond remains uncertain and unpredictable.  For a discussion of certain risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the risk factor titled \u201cWe may be negatively impacted by adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.  For a discussion of the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u200bOur Strategy\u200bThe Company\u2019s overall strategy is to provide our customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of quality and service on a worldwide basis, while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control.  Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:\u200b\u25cfPursue broad market diversification - The Company constantly strives to increase the diversity of its markets, customers, applications and products.  Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is important to participate wherever significant growth opportunities are available.  This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any one particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance.  An overview of the Company\u2019s market and product participation is described under \u201cMarkets\u201d.\u200b\u25cfDevelop high-technology performance-enhancing solutions - The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships with customers across its diverse end markets.  The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions.  These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect, antenna and sensor products, and have been developed across the Company\u2019s end markets.  The Company is focused on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as antennas and sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base.\u200b\u25cfExpand global presence - The Company is strategically expanding and shifting its global manufacturing, engineering, sales and service operations to better serve its existing customer base, penetrate developing markets and establish new customer relationships.  As the Company\u2019s global customers have grown their international operations to access developing world markets and lower manufacturing costs, the Company is continuing to expand and shift its international footprint in order to provide real-time capabilities to these customers.  The majority of the Company\u2019s international operations have broad capabilities, including new product development.  4 Table of Contents Table of Contents Reportable Business Segments prior to 2022\u200bThrough December 31, 2021, the Company operated through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions.

The Cable Products and Solutions segment primarily designed, manufactured and marketed cable, value-add products and components for use primarily in the broadband communications and information technology markets, as well as certain applications in other markets.\u200bCOVID-19 Pandemic\u200bSince early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our offices and manufacturing facilities around the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers\u2019 contract manufacturers.  These disruptions have included, and may continue to include, government regulations that inhibit our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course, travel restrictions, supplier constraints, supply chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers.  During much of 2022, COVID-19 outbreaks in China resulted in local or regional government-imposed lockdowns and restrictions, which impacted the ability of several of our operations and manufacturing facilities to operate in the ordinary course.  As of December 31, 2022, there continue to be isolated COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions of the world, particularly in China, but these outbreaks have not had a significant impact on our operations.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2023 and beyond remains uncertain and unpredictable.  For a discussion of certain risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the risk factor titled \u201cWe may be negatively impacted by adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u200bOur Strategy\u200bThe Company\u2019s overall strategy is to provide our customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of quality and service on a worldwide basis, while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control.  Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:\u200b\u25cfPursue broad market diversification - The Company constantly strives to increase the diversity of its markets, customers, applications and products.  Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is important to participate wherever significant growth opportunities are available.  This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any one particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance.  An overview of the Company\u2019s market and product participation is described under \u201cMarkets\u201d.\u200b\u25cfDevelop high-technology performance-enhancing solutions - The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships with customers across its diverse end markets.  The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions.  These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect, antenna and sensor products, and have been developed across the Company\u2019s end markets.  The Company is focused on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as antennas and sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base.\u200b\u25cfExpand global presence - The Company is strategically expanding and shifting its global manufacturing, engineering, sales and service operations to better serve its existing customer base, penetrate developing markets and establish new customer relationships.  As the Company\u2019s global customers have grown their international operations to access developing world markets and lower manufacturing costs, the Company is continuing to expand and shift its international footprint in order to provide real-time capabilities to these customers.  The majority of the Company\u2019s international operations have broad capabilities, including new product development.   Reportable Business Segments prior to 2022 \u200b Through December 31, 2021, the Company operated through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions.  The Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment primarily designed, manufactured and marketed a broad range of connector and connector systems, value-add products and other products, including antennas and sensors, used in a wide range of applications in a diverse set of end markets.  Interconnect products included connectors which, when attached to an electrical, electronic or fiber optic cable, a printed circuit board or other device, facilitate transmission of power or signals.  Value-add systems generally consisted of a system of cable, flexible circuits or printed circuit boards and connectors, antennas or sensors for linking electronic equipment.  The Cable Products and Solutions segment primarily designed, manufactured and marketed cable, value-add products and components for use primarily in the broadband communications and information technology markets, as well as certain applications in other markets. \u200b COVID-19 Pandemic \u200b Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our offices and manufacturing facilities around the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers\u2019 contract manufacturers.  These disruptions have included, and may continue to include, government regulations that inhibit our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course, travel restrictions, supplier constraints, supply chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers.  During much of 2022, COVID-19 outbreaks in China resulted in local or regional government-imposed lockdowns and restrictions, which impacted the ability of several of our operations and manufacturing facilities to operate in the ordinary course.

Primary competitors include Aptiv, Belden, Carlisle, Commscope, Eaton, Foxconn, Glenair, HARTING, Hirose, HUBER+SUHNER, ICT Luxshare, JAE, Jonhon, JST, Molex, Phoenix Contact, Radiall, Rosenberger, Sensata, TE Connectivity, Yazaki and 3M, among others.  In addition, the Company competes with a large number of smaller companies who compete in specific geographies, markets or products.  For a discussion of certain risks related to competition, refer to the risk factor titled \u201cThe Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of our business\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.\u200bBacklog and Seasonality\u200bThe Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled firm orders as of December\u00a031, 2022 was approximately $4.1 billion\u00a0compared with backlog of approximately $3.8 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021.  Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions.  Unfilled orders may generally be cancelled prior to shipment of goods.  It is expected that nearly all of the Company\u2019s backlog will be filled within the next 12 months.  Significant elements of the Company\u2019s business, such as sales to the communications-related markets (including wireless communications, information technology and data communications and broadband communications) and sales to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.  Generally, the Company does not experience significant seasonality in its business, although historically, the strongest quarters have typically been the last two quarters of our fiscal year.\u200bCybersecurity\u200bIn an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber incidents, the Company has a cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and systems.  We perform risk assessments and penetration tests relating to cybersecurity and technology risks. We also conduct workforce training to instruct employees how to better identify cybersecurity concerns and to avoid actions that might inadvertently allow outsiders to access our systems. We have installed end point protection software on our Company-managed systems and workstations in an effort to detect and prevent malicious code from impacting our systems. The Company\u2019s annual internal audits also include procedures performed on the control environment related to our information security systems. Our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) maintains oversight responsibility relating to our information security and cybersecurity program, with assistance from the Audit Committee of the Board.  At least annually, our senior leadership team (including the leaders of our Information Technology and Internal Audit teams) provides an update of our information security and cybersecurity program to the full Board.  In addition, the Company maintains standard cybersecurity insurance.  During the last three years, we have not experienced a material security breach and, as a result, we have not incurred any material expenses from such a breach. Furthermore, during such time, we have not been penalized or paid any amount under any information security breach settlement.  For a discussion of certain risks related to cybersecurity, refer to the risk factor titled \u201cCybersecurity incidents affecting our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations and fines\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.\u200bEnvironmental Matters\u200bCertain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.

One of the key components of our business strategy is the fostering of a collaborative and entrepreneurial management culture. Each of our general managers operates in a flat organizational structure and is incented to grow and develop their business, with the support of the resources of the larger organization.  We believe this structure, with approximately 130 general managers running unique, independent businesses, creates an environment and culture where each of our general managers has a more direct link to the success of their individual businesses and a more personal connection to the employees they oversee and the communities in which they operate.\u200bAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 91,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 11,000 were located in the United States.  Less than 10% of Amphenol\u2019s U.S. workforce is represented by an independent trade union or covered by collective bargaining.  The Company believes that it has a good relationship with both its unionized and non-unionized employees. \u200bGovernance and Culture \u2013 Our Board is actively involved in overseeing the Company\u2019s employee-related strategies and practices as well as the Company\u2019s culture and ESG initiatives. This oversight is conducted both directly and through certain of the Board\u2019s committees.  At each of its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings, the Board reviews changes in key personnel and, at least once a year, meets with management to discuss various human resources related topics, including talent development, succession planning, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, compensation and culture. We believe the Company\u2019s culture has been a critical component of the Company\u2019s success and reinforcing that culture is a key responsibility of our executive management.\u200bDiversity, Equity and Inclusion \u2013 Amphenol is committed to workplace diversity and fostering a culture of equity, inclusion and belonging across our organization.  Our business spans the globe, and the employees in our facilities reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate.

The Company generally relies on local management in every business unit to foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and a deep commitment to our people and the local community.  A key hallmark of our structure is our entrepreneurial culture that creates clear accountability for each of our general managers, who are our key business leaders.  Our core management team is comprised of these general managers and their controllers, as well as our executive management team.  Women represented 27% of this core management team at the end of 2022.

We believe that this model of coaching and tracking at the corporate level, but administering at the facility level, has allowed us to provide training and supervision that better fits the local needs of each of our workforces.\u200bCompensation and Benefits \u2013 The Company is focused on providing our employees around the world equitable and competitive compensation and benefits.  In the U.S., in addition to competitive compensation, the Company maintains various employee benefits such as health and related insurance, retirement savings programs and health savings and flexible spending accounts.  Outside the U.S., we maintain compensation and other benefits competitive with local market conditions.\u200bCommunity and Social Impact \u2013 Amphenol recognizes that we have a responsibility to be a positive influence in the communities in which we operate around the world. Most of our community outreach is organized by our local management teams, which helps ensure that our efforts are working in support of the local communities in which our employees live and work.  Our local teams are actively supporting their communities in a variety of ways including: school supply drives, local blood drives, mentoring of at-risk students, community clean-up events, local tree planting, holiday-giving events and food delivery services.  In 2022, a number of our operations in Europe supported refugees who were fleeing Ukraine following the Russian invasion.\u200b\u200b12 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u200bHuman Capital Management and Our Culture\u200bThe Company\u2019s success is closely tied to the capability, adaptability and accountability of our diverse, global organization.

We believe this structure, with approximately 130 general managers running unique, independent businesses, creates an environment and culture where each of our general managers has a more direct link to the success of their individual businesses and a more personal connection to the employees they oversee and the communities in which they operate. \u200b As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 91,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 11,000 were located in the United States.  Less than 10% of Amphenol\u2019s U.S. workforce is represented by an independent trade union or covered by collective bargaining.  The Company believes that it has a good relationship with both its unionized and non-unionized employees.  \u200b Governance and Culture \u2013 Our Board is actively involved in overseeing the Company\u2019s employee-related strategies and practices as well as the Company\u2019s culture and ESG initiatives. This oversight is conducted both directly and through certain of the Board\u2019s committees.  At each of its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings, the Board reviews changes in key personnel and, at least once a year, meets with management to discuss various human resources related topics, including talent development, succession planning, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, compensation and culture. We believe the Company\u2019s culture has been a critical component of the Company\u2019s success and reinforcing that culture is a key responsibility of our executive management. \u200b Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \u2013 Amphenol is committed to workplace diversity and fostering a culture of equity, inclusion and belonging across our organization.  Our business spans the globe, and the employees in our facilities reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate.  At Amphenol, we promote and maintain a culture of respect and appreciation of differences in our employees.  The Company generally relies on local management in every business unit to foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and a deep commitment to our people and the local community.  A key hallmark of our structure is our entrepreneurial culture that creates clear accountability for each of our general managers, who are our key business leaders.  Our core management team is comprised of these general managers and their controllers, as well as our executive management team.  Women represented 27% of this core management team at the end of 2022.  Of our total employees worldwide, approximately half are women. \u200b Health, Safety and Well-being \u2013 We believe that the protection of our employees is a moral obligation.  In addition, the safety and well-being of our employees is critical to the successful operation of our business.  Our health and safety activities are overseen by our corporate environmental, health, safety and sustainability leadership team and are managed by our local teams, who coordinate on-site safety programs, resources, reporting and training in our facilities. We believe that this model of coaching and tracking at the corporate level, but administering at the facility level, has allowed us to provide training and supervision that better fits the local needs of each of our workforces. \u200b Compensation and Benefits \u2013 The Company is focused on providing our employees around the world equitable and competitive compensation and benefits.  In the U.S., in addition to competitive compensation, the Company maintains various employee benefits such as health and related insurance, retirement savings programs and health savings and flexible spending accounts.  Outside the U.S., we maintain compensation and other benefits competitive with local market conditions. \u200b Community and Social Impact \u2013 Amphenol recognizes that we have a responsibility to be a positive influence in the communities in which we operate around the world. Most of our community outreach is organized by our local management teams, which helps ensure that our efforts are working in support of the local communities in which our employees live and work.  Our local teams are actively supporting their communities in a variety of ways including: school supply drives, local blood drives, mentoring of at-risk students, community clean-up events, local tree planting, holiday-giving events and food delivery services.  In 2022, a number of our operations in Europe supported refugees who were fleeing Ukraine following the Russian invasion. \u200b \u200b 12 12 12  Table of ContentsAvailable Information\u200bThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, including Amphenol, that file with the SEC.

Risk Factors\u200bThe Company\u2019s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and stock price can be negatively affected by many risk factors.  Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this Annual Report.  The Company\u2019s past financial performance, including historical trends, should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that we currently consider immaterial may materialize and impair the Company\u2019s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and/or stock price.  \u200bIf actions taken by management to limit, monitor or control enterprise risk exposures are not successful, the Company\u2019s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and debt securities could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\u200bRISKS RELATED TO OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS\u200bThe Company is exposed to political, economic, military and other risks related to operating in countries outside the United States, and changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\u200bThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.  During 2022, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 67% of the Company\u2019s net sales, with China constituting approximately 26% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company employs nearly 90% of its workforce outside the United States. The Company\u2019s customers are located throughout the world, and the Company has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States. \u200bDuring the last few years there have also been significant changes to U.S. trade policies, sanctions, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including, but not limited to, trade policies and tariffs affecting China.  These changes have, in certain cases, increased our costs of doing business.  The imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets, and may cause our customers to find alternative sourcing or could make it more difficult for us to sell our products in some markets.  Other countries where we operate or sell our products have changed, and may continue to change, their own policies on trade as well as business and foreign investment in their respective countries. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations.  As a result of these dynamics, we cannot predict the impact to our business of any future changes to the U.S.\u2019s or other countries\u2019 trading relationships or the impact of new laws or regulations adopted by the U.S. or other countries.\u200b\u200b13 Table of Contents Table of Contents Available Information\u200bThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, including Amphenol, that file with the SEC.
