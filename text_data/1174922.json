{"cik": 1174922, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business   Our Company  Wynn Resorts, Limited (\"Wynn Resorts,\" or together with its subsidiaries, \"we\" or the \"Company\") is a preeminent designer, developer, and operator of integrated resorts featuring luxury hotel rooms, high-end retail space, an array of dining and entertainment options, meeting and convention facilities, and gaming, all supported by an unparalleled focus on our guests, our people, and our community. We believe that our extensive design and operational experience across numerous gaming jurisdictions provides us with a distinct advantage over other gaming enterprises.     Through our approximately 72% ownership of Wynn Macau, Limited (\"WML\"), we operate two integrated resorts in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (\"Macau\"), Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau (collectively, our \"Macau Operations\"). In Las Vegas, Nevada, we operate and, with the exception of certain retail space, own 100% of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which we also refer to as our Las Vegas Operations. In Everett, Massachusetts, we operate Encore Boston Harbor, an integrated resort. In addition, we hold an approximately 97% interest in Wynn Interactive Ltd. (\"Wynn Interactive\"), which operates WynnBet, our digital sports betting and casino gaming business.   Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form\u00a08-K and all other reports and any amendments of such reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") are available, without charge, at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, through our corporate website at www.wynnresorts.com, Wynn Resorts provides a hyperlink to a third-party SEC filing website which makes available all such reports and amendments and where they can be viewed without charge. The information found on or linked through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor does it form a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.  Recent Developments  COVID-19 Update  Macau Operations  Since the outbreak of COVID-19, visitation to Macau has fallen significantly, driven by the strong deterrent effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel and social activities, quarantine measures put in place in Macau and elsewhere, travel and entry restrictions and conditions in Macau, the People's Republic of China (the \"PRC\"), Hong Kong and Taiwan involving COVID-19 testing and mandatory quarantine, among other things, periods of mandatory closure of certain businesses and facilities, including gaming operations, and the suspension or reduced accessibility of transportation to and from Macau. Over the course of December 2022 and January 2023, Macau authorities relaxed or eliminated most COVID-19 related protective measures, and as of February 27, 2023, there are no remaining entry restrictions or mandatory quarantine requirements in place for travelers to Macau, and testing requirements for inbound travelers from the PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have been discontinued. Nevertheless, given the inherent uncertainty around the likelihood, extent, and timing of a potential reimposition of restrictions on the general public, travel, or certain activities, management is unable to reasonably predict whether such restrictions would impact our properties in the future, or the extent such restrictions, if reimposed, would impact our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.  Liquidity  As of December\u00a031, 2022, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, of $3.65 billion, and had access to $837.0\u00a0million of available borrowing capacity from the WRF Revolver (as defined in Item 8 \u2013\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 7, \"Long-Term Debt\"). As of December\u00a031, 2022, the WM Cayman II Revolver (as defined in Item 8 \u2013 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 7, \"Long-Term Debt\") was fully drawn. As a result of the negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, on our operating income, the Company has suspended its dividend program. Given the Company's liquidity position as of December\u00a031, 2022, the Company believes it will be able to support continuing operations and respond to a potential reimposition of COVID-19 related restrictions on the general public, travel, or certain activities and their related economic disruptions.   3  3  3  Table of Contents Table of Contents  Our Strategy   We conceptualize, design, build, and operate our resorts to create unforgettable customer experiences across a diverse set of gaming and non-gaming amenities that attract a wide range of customer segments and generate strong financial results.   Central to our strategy is the construction of, and regular reinvestment in, world-class integrated resorts. These activities are led by our in-house design, development, and construction subsidiary and its senior management team, which has significant experience across all major design and construction disciplines. In addition, we believe superior customer service is the best marketing strategy to attract customers and drive repeat visitation to our resorts. Human resources and staff training are essential to ensuring our employees are prepared to provide the luxury service that our guests expect. We have been successful in attracting a wide range of premium guests both domestically and internationally. We leverage our marketing team across branch offices located in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, and Canada to connect with and build relationships with our customers. We continually evaluate our offerings and service levels, and as a result, have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to our resorts.  We plan to continue to seek out new opportunities to develop and operate world-class integrated resorts and related businesses around the world. Overall, we believe Wynn Resorts has a demonstrated track record of developing and operating integrated resorts that stimulate local and regional economic activity, by attracting a wide range of customers (including high-net-worth international tourists), driving international tourism, raising average hotel room rates in the region, extending the average length of stay per visitor, complementing existing convention and meeting business with five-star accommodations and appropriately scaled meeting amenities, elevating service levels with the execution of five-star customer service, and stimulating city-wide investment and employment.

In Macau and across the Greater Bay Area, which is the region encompassing Macau, Hong Kong, and southern Guangdong Province, we strive to drive reinvestment in our community, encourage volunteerism, and promote responsible gaming through our Wynn Care program. Since launching this program, we have centralized our community-focused initiatives under one umbrella and meaningfully increased our involvement in various volunteer activities and community events in Macau, the Greater Bay Area, and beyond. We are also fully committed to supporting the sustainable development of Macau and endeavor to provide our guests with a premium experience while remaining environmentally conscious by monitoring and reducing inefficient energy and resource consumption and embracing technologies that help us to responsibly use our resources. In addition, we provide our employees in Macau with numerous professional development and training opportunities to elevate core and leadership skills.   Executing on Our Strategy  Reflecting our strategic focus, our values, and our commitment to delivering world-class, five-star service within luxury integrated resorts, the Company has received the following recognition:  \u2022Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas have each earned Five-Star status on the 2023 Forbes Travel Guide (\"FTG\") Star Rating list and are the largest and second largest FTG Five-Star resorts in the world, respectively. Wynn Palace, originally earning FTG Five-Star status in 2018, is the third largest. \u2022Collectively, Wynn Resorts earned more FTG Five-Star awards than any other independent hotel company in the world in 2023. \u2022Wynn Palace garnered seven individual FTG Five-Star awards in 2023.  \u2022Wynn Macau continues to be the only resort in the world with eight individual FTG Five-Star awards in 2023.  \u2022Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace are the most decorated integrated resort brands in Asia with fifteen FTG Five-Star awards combined.  \u2022Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas collectively received seven FTG Five-Star awards in 2023, the most of any resorts in North America. \u2022Wynn Resorts was once again honored to be included on FORTUNE Magazine's 2022 World's Most Admired Companies list in the hotel, casino, and resort category and ranked first overall in the category of Quality of Products/ Services among all international hotel companies. \u2022Wynn Las Vegas has received Four Green Globes, the highest certification for energy-efficient and sustainable buildings from the Green Building Initiative. \u2022Encore Boston Harbor has been certified LEED Platinum, the U.S. Green Building Council's highest level of certification.  Our Resorts  We present the operating results of our four resorts in the following segments: Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, Las Vegas Operations, and Encore Boston Harbor. We generally experience fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from month to month, including from such factors as the timing of major conventions and holidays; however, we do not believe that our business is materially impacted by seasonality.   Wynn Palace  We opened Wynn Palace in August 2016, on Macau's Cotai Strip, conveniently located minutes from both Macau International Airport and the Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal and directly adjacent to a stop serviced by Macau's light rail system. The property features approximately 468,000 square feet of casino space with 287 table games and 560 slot machines, as well as private gaming salons and sky casinos. Wynn Palace also features a luxury hotel tower with a total of 1,706 guest rooms, suites, and villas, offering a health club, spa, salon, and pool. In addition, Wynn Palace offers 14 food and beverage outlets,  5  5  5  Table of Contents Table of Contents  approximately 107,000 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail space, and approximately 37,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. The property's signature public attractions and entertainment offerings include a performance lake, a gondola ride offering convenient street-level access, and an exceptional display of Western and Asian art.  We are in the design stages of developing the next phase of Wynn Palace. We currently expect that the next phase at Wynn Palace will incorporate an array of amenities such as theater and event space, interactive entertainment installations, food and beverage features, and other non-gaming offerings.  Wynn Macau  We opened Wynn Macau in September 2006, and Encore, an expansion of Wynn Macau, in April 2010. Located in the heart of downtown Macau, the property features approximately 294,000 square feet of casino space with 276 table games and 567 slot machines, as well as private gaming salons, sky casinos, and a poker room.

Las Vegas Operations  We opened Wynn Las Vegas in April 2005 and Encore, an expansion of Wynn Las Vegas, in December 2008. Wynn Las Vegas is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, and occupies approximately 215 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip. The property features approximately 194,000 square feet of casino space with 233 table games and 1,674 slot machines, as well as private gaming salons, a sky casino, a poker room, and a race and sports book.

Our nightlife and entertainment offerings at Wynn Las Vegas include two nightclubs and a beach club, and two theaters presenting entertainment productions and various headliner entertainment acts. In November 2022 we completed the reconfiguration of one of our theater spaces, which now hosts an exclusive theatrical production, Awakening.  Encore Boston Harbor  On June 23, 2019, we opened Encore Boston Harbor, an integrated resort in Everett, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston along the Mystic River. The property features approximately 213,000 square feet of casino space with 197 table games, 24 poker tables and approximately 2,546 slot machines, private and high-limit gaming areas, and a sports book.

Future Development Projects  In January 2022, we, along with Al Marjan Island and RAK Hospitality, announced plans for the development and management of a destination integrated resort property (the \"Marjan Project\") on Island 3, Al Marjan Island in the Emirate of Ras al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. The Marjan Project, which is currently in the design phase, is anticipated to be completed and open to the public in early 2027, featuring an over 1,000-room hotel, a high-end shopping mall, a state-of-the-art meeting and convention facility, an exclusive spa, more than 10 restaurants and lounges, a wide array of entertainment choices, a gaming area (subject to regulatory approval), and other amenities. The planned integrated resort will leverage Wynn Resorts' expertise in developing and operating luxury hospitality destinations, and is expected to create substantial value to the local economy by accelerating tourism, creating jobs, and contributing to the growth of related sectors. Wynn Resorts holds a minority equity interest in the entity which owns the Marjan Project.  6  6  6  Table of Contents Table of Contents  Wynn Interactive  Wynn Resorts holds an approximately 97% interest in, and consolidates, Wynn Interactive. Wynn Interactive's subsidiary operates the digital sports betting and casino gaming business known as WynnBET in Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, and Virginia. The results of Wynn Interactive's operations are presented within the Wynn Interactive reportable segment.  Market and Competition  The casino resort industry is highly competitive. We compete with other high-quality resorts on the basis of the range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, themes and size, among other factors. We seek to differentiate our integrated resorts by delivering superior design and customer service.    Macau  Macau, located in the Greater Bay Area, is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of Hong Kong. Following the cessation of certain COVID-19 pandemic-related travel restrictions in January 2023, the journey between Macau and Hong Kong takes approximately 15 minutes by helicopter, 30 minutes by road via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, and one hour by jetfoil ferry. Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 50 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane, between which the Cotai area is located. In addition to Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. (\"Wynn Macau SA\"), SJM Resorts, S.A. (\"SJM\"), Galaxy Casino, S.A. (\"Galaxy\"), Venetian Macau, S.A. (\"Venetian Macau\"), Melco Resorts (Macau) Limited (\"Melco\"), and MGM Grand Paradise Limited (\"MGM Macau\") are permitted to operate casinos in Macau, with a total of 30 casinos currently in operation.  Macau's gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists, typically traveling from nearby destinations in Asia. Visitation to Macau grew significantly in the years leading up to the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, but has since fallen meaningfully, primarily due to certain border control and other travel related restrictions which were in place throughout the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as a result of the pandemic. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, tourist arrivals in Macau decreased 85.5% in 2022 compared to 2019, and 26.0% in 2022 compared to 2021.  We believe that the Macau region hosts one of the world's largest concentrations of potential gaming and tourism customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, annual gaming revenues were $36.5\u00a0billion in 2019, before falling to $7.6\u00a0billion in 2020, $10.8\u00a0billion in 2021 and $5.3\u00a0billion in 2022, due to various quarantine measures and travel and entry restrictions and conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19. We continue to believe that, despite the recent challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Macau's stated goal of becoming a world-class tourism destination will continue to drive additional visitation to the market and create future opportunities for us to invest and grow.  Our Macau Operations face competition primarily from the 28 other casinos located throughout Macau in addition to casinos located throughout the world, including Singapore, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Australia, Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Additionally, certain other Asian countries and regions have legalized or in the future may legalize gaming, such as Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, which could increase competition for our Macau Operations.  Las Vegas  Las Vegas is the largest gaming market in the United States.\u00a0The Las Vegas gaming market is highly competitive and is largely dependent on tourist arrivals and meeting- and convention-related visitation.  Las Vegas Strip gaming revenues increased significantly during the year ended December\u00a031, 2022 due to increases in gaming volumes and visitation to the Las Vegas Strip. According to statistics published by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, Las Vegas Strip total gaming win was $8.3 billion in 2022, a 16.9% increase from $7.1 billion in 2021. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, overall Las Vegas visitor volume was 38.8 million in 2022, a 20.5% increase from 32.2 million in 2021. Occupancy on the Las Vegas Strip increased 20.0% to 81.6%, from 68.0% in 2021. Convention attendees increased by 126.2% in 2022 and 27.7% in 2021, after a 74.0% decrease in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, following year-over-year increases of 7.1%, 3.0%, and 2.3% from 2017 to 2019, respectively.  7  7  7  Table of Contents Table of Contents  Our Las Vegas Operations are located on the Las Vegas Strip and compete with other high-quality resorts and hotel casinos in Las Vegas. There are currently several large-scale integrated resort projects either recently completed or under development in the vicinity of our Las Vegas Operations, which may present increased competition in the future. Our Las Vegas Operations also compete, to some extent, with other casino resorts throughout the United States and elsewhere in the world.  Massachusetts  Massachusetts and its neighboring states of Connecticut and Rhode Island are host to a large, established casino market that generated over $2.9\u00a0billion of gross gaming revenue in 2022, and over $2.8\u00a0billion of gross gaming revenue in 2021. The greater Boston metropolitan area is the largest population center in New England, with a population of approximately 5 million residents.  Gaming in the New England region is characterized by a high degree of competition, based largely on location, product quality, service levels, and effectiveness in marketing to and establishing relationships with repeat visitors located in the area. Encore Boston Harbor competes with both commercial and Native American casinos located in the northeastern United States, including two Native American casinos in Connecticut, two casinos in Rhode Island, and MGM Springfield in Massachusetts. Differences in regulatory landscapes across state borders may impact our ability to compete with other casinos in the region. For example, some casino operators in the region may pay lower gaming taxes, or may be permitted to offer gaming amenities we are currently unable to offer at Encore Boston Harbor. We also face competition, to a lesser degree, from operations in the region which offer other forms of legalized gaming and related recreation and leisure facilities, such as state lotteries, horse racing, online gaming, and sports betting.  Digital Sports Betting and Casino Gaming  Wynn Interactive operates within the digital casino and sports betting industry. The global gaming industry includes a wide array of products from lotteries to bingo, slot machines, casino games, and sports betting, across land-based and online platforms. There are numerous operators and stakeholders across both the public and private sectors. Industry participants include traditional brick-and-mortar casinos, state-run lottery operators, Native American tribes, legacy digital casino operators as well as racetracks, racinos, video lottery terminals and gaming technology companies.  We compete on a number of factors across our digital casino and sports betting platforms. These include, but are not limited to, our front-end online product, our back-end infrastructure, our ability to retain and monetize existing customers, re-engage prior customers and acquire new customers and our regulatory access and compliance experience.  Regulation and Licensing  Macau  On December 16, 2022, Wynn Macau SA, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered into a definitive gaming concession contract (the \"Gaming Concession Contract\") with the Macau government, pursuant to which Wynn Macau SA was granted a 10-year gaming concession commencing on January 1, 2023 and expiring on December 31, 2032, to operate games of chance at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau.   As a casino concessionaire, Wynn Macau SA is subject to the regulatory control of the government of Macau. The government has adopted Laws and Administrative Regulations governing the operation of casinos in Macau. Only concessionaires are permitted to operate casinos. Each concessionaire was required to enter into a concession agreement with the Macau government which, together with the Law and Administrative Regulations, form the framework for the regulation of the activities of the concessionaire.  Under the Law and Administrative Regulations, concessionaires are subject to suitability requirements relating to background, associations and reputation, as are stockholders of 5% or more of a concessionaire's equity securities, officers, directors and key employees.

Concessionaires are subject to a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenue, and must also make an annual contribution of up to 5% of gross gaming revenue for the promotion of public interests, social security, infrastructure and tourism. Concessionaires are obligated to withhold applicable taxes, according to the rate in effect as set by the government, from any commissions paid to gaming promoters. The withholding rate may be adjusted from time to time.  The Gaming Concession Contract between Wynn Macau SA and the Macau government requires Wynn Macau SA to operate two casinos: \"Casino Wynn Macau\" and \"Casino Wynn Palace.\"  Under the Gaming Concession Contract, Wynn Macau SA provided a first demand bank guarantee of MOP1.00 billion (approximately $124.5\u00a0million) in favor of the Macau government to support Wynn Macau SA\u2019s legal and contractual obligations, from January 1, 2023 until one hundred and eighty days after the term of the Gaming Concession Contract expires or the rescission of the concession.

Beginning in the eighth year of Wynn Macau SA\u2019s concession, the Macau government may exercise its right to redeem the concession by providing Wynn Macau SA with at least one-year prior written notice. In such event, Wynn Macau SA would be entitled to fair and equitable compensation pursuant to the Macau gaming law. The amount of such compensation relating to the projects agreed with the Macau government would be determined based on the earnings of these projects, before interest, depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year immediately preceding the date the redemption is declared, multiplied by the number of years remaining on the term of the Gaming Concession Contract. The government of Macau may assume temporary custody and control over the operation of a concession in certain circumstances. During any such period, the costs of operations must be borne by the concessionaire.   Wynn Macau SA is required to obtain prior approval from the relevant Macau authorities or officials for various corporate changes and actions, including expansion of its business scope, issuance of shares, transfer of or creation of any encumbrances over its shares, issuance of debt securities, change of its managing director or the authority delegated thereto, change of its articles of association, certain transfers of property rights and creditor\u2019s rights, entering into a consumer loan contract or similar contract with a value equal to or exceeding MOP100.0 million (approximately US$12.5 million), and granting of a loan to any of its directors, shareholders or key employees.

Officers, directors and certain key employees of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the registered intermediary subsidiaries and our officers and directors who are actively and directly involved in the gaming activities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may  10  10  10  Table of Contents Table of Contents  require additional applications and may also deny an application for licensing for any reason which they deem appropriate. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. An applicant for licensing or an applicant for a finding of suitability must pay or must cause to be paid all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensing, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have the jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.  If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director, or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the registered intermediary subsidiaries, or us, we would have to sever all relationships with the person. In addition, the Nevada Gaming Authorities may require Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the registered intermediary subsidiaries, or us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability are not subject to judicial review.    If the NGC determines that we, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, or a registered intermediary subsidiary have violated the Nevada Act, it could limit, condition, suspend or revoke our and our intermediary subsidiary registrations and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC's gaming license. In addition, we and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at the discretion of the NGC. Further, the NGC could appoint a supervisor to operate Wynn Las Vegas and, under specified circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor's appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the premises) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. The limitation, conditioning or suspension of any of our gaming licenses and the appointment of a supervisor could, and revocation of any gaming license would, have a significant negative effect on our gaming operations.  Periodically, we are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the NGC and provide any other information that the NGC may require. Substantially all of our material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to, and/or approved by, the NGC.  Any beneficial owner of our voting or nonvoting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated and have that person's suitability as a beneficial owner of voting securities determined if the NGC has reason to believe that the ownership would be inconsistent with Nevada's declared public policies. If the beneficial owner of the voting or nonvoting securities of Wynn Resorts who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information, including a list of its beneficial owners. The applicant must pay all costs of the investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any investigation.  The Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the NGC. The Nevada Act requires beneficial owners of more than 10% of a registered company's voting securities to apply to the NGC for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chair of the NGCB mails the written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an \"institutional investor\" as defined in the Nevada Act which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of a registered company's voting securities may apply to the NGC for a waiver of a finding of suitability if the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may hold more than 25% but not more than 29% of a registered company's voting securities and may, in certain circumstances, own up to 29% of the voting securities of a registered company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver.  An institutional investor will not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the registered company, a change in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered company, or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the NGC finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered company's voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities which are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:  \u2022voting on all matters voted on by stockholders or interest holders; \u2022making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in management, policies or operations; and \u2022other activities that the NGC may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.  11  11  11  Table of Contents Table of Contents  We are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada which may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make the disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are required to provide maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner of any of our voting securities. The NGC has the power to require the stock certificates of any registered company to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Act. The certificates representing shares of Wynn Resorts' common stock note that the shares are subject to a right of redemption and other restrictions set forth in Wynn Resorts' articles of incorporation and bylaws and that the shares are, or may become, subject to restrictions imposed by applicable gaming laws.  Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30\u00a0days after being ordered to do so by the NGC or by the Chair of the NGCB, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with the investigation of its application may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of any voting security or debt security of a registered company beyond the period of time as may be prescribed by the NGC may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to hold an equity interest or to have any other relationship with us, we:  \u2022pay that person any dividend or interest upon any voting securities; \u2022allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right held by that person relating to Wynn Resorts; \u2022pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or \u2022fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to relinquish such person's voting securities, including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.  The NGC may, in its discretion, require the owner of any debt or similar securities of a registered public company, to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt or other securities of the registered company if the NGC has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with Nevada's declared public policies. If the NGC decides that a person is unsuitable to own the securities, then under the Nevada Act, the registered public company can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals if, without the prior approval of the NGC, it  \u2022pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or any distribution whatsoever; \u2022recognizes any voting right by the unsuitable person in connection with the securities; \u2022pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or \u2022makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.   We may not make a public offering (debt or equity) without the prior approval of the NGC if the proceeds from the offering are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or for similar transactions. On March\u00a017, 2022, the NGC granted Wynn Resorts prior approval, subject to certain conditions, to make public offerings for a period of three years (the \"Shelf Approval\"). The Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chair of the NGCB.  Changes in control of Wynn Resorts through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or any act or conduct by a person whereby the person obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the NGC. Entities seeking to acquire control of a registered public company must satisfy the NGCB and the NGC concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control of the registered public company.  The NGC may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.  The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada gaming licensees and registered public companies that are affiliated with the operations of Nevada gaming licensees may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. The NGC has  12  12  12  Table of Contents Table of Contents  established a regulatory scheme to reduce the potential adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada's gaming industry and to further Nevada's policy in order to:  \u2022assure the financial stability of corporate gaming licensees and their affiliated companies; \u2022preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and \u2022promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.  Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the NGC before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above its current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered company's Board of Directors in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control.  The Nevada Act requires any person who individually or in association with others, acquires or holds any amount of any class of voting securities, or each plan sponsor of a pension or employee benefit plan that acquires or holds any amount of any class of voting securities in a registered public company with the intent to engage in an activity that necessitates an amendment to a corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operation of a registered public company, to engage in an activity that materially influences or affects the affairs of a registered public company, or to engage any other activity that the NGC determines is inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes to, within 2 days after possession of that intent, notify the NGCB Chair and apply to the NGC for a finding of suitability within 30 days after notification to the NGCB Chair.   License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the licensed subsidiaries' respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage of the gross revenue received; the number of gaming devices operated; or the number of table games operated. A live entertainment tax also is imposed on admission charges where live entertainment is furnished.  Because we are involved in gaming ventures outside of Nevada, we are required to deposit with the NGCB, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation of the NGCB of our participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the NGC. Thereafter, we are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act. A licensee or registrant is also subject to disciplinary action by the NGC if it:  \u2022knowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation; \u2022fails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations; \u2022engages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect, discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada; \u2022engages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or \u2022employs, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of unsuitability.   The conduct of gaming activities and the service and sale of alcoholic beverages at Wynn Las Vegas are subject to licensing, control and regulation by the CCLGLB, which has granted Wynn Las Vegas, LLC licenses for such purposes. In addition to approving Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the CCLGLB has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the equity of any entity controlling a gaming license. Certain of our officers, directors and key employees have been or may be required to file applications with the CCLGLB. Clark County gaming and liquor licenses are not transferable. The County has full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license. Any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a substantial negative impact on our operations.  Massachusetts  The Massachusetts Expanded Gaming Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively the \"Massachusetts Act\") subjects the owners and operators of gaming establishments to extensive state licensing and regulatory requirements. We  13  13  13  Table of Contents Table of Contents  are subject to the Massachusetts Act through our ownership interest in Wynn MA, LLC, (\"Wynn MA\") which operates Encore Boston Harbor.  The Massachusetts Gaming Commission (\"MGC\") is responsible for issuing licenses under the Massachusetts Act and assuring that licenses are not issued or held by unqualified, disqualified or unsuitable persons. The MGC, in particular its Investigations and Enforcement Bureau (\"IEB\"), which is a bureau within the MGC, has extensive authority to conduct background investigations of applicants and licensees, and for generally enforcing the Massachusetts Act. The MGC has the authority to award up to three Category 1 licenses (table games and slot machines), and one Category 2 license (slot machines only), within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to qualified applicants.  On September 17, 2014, the MGC designated Wynn MA the award winner of the Category 1 Greater Boston gaming license effective November 7, 2014. We, our relevant subsidiaries, and individual qualifiers required to be qualified have been found suitable by the MGC. Additional entities and key employees have been and will be required to file applications with the MGC and are or may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the MGC. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the MGC.  If the MGC were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the MGC may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  The initial license term is for 15 years, which commenced upon the MGC\u2019s confirmation of its approval of the commencement of the operation of the gaming establishment on June 27, 2019. Wynn MA's gaming license is conditioned upon Wynn MA continuing to meet applicable licensing, registration, qualification and other regulatory requirements. The initial license fee for Category 1 licenses is $85,000,000, which Wynn MA has paid. All Category 1 and Category 2 gaming licenses are also subject to additional annual fees under the Massachusetts Act. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts also receives 25% of gross gaming revenues for Category 1 licensees.   Encore Boston Harbor was granted a sports wagering license by the MGC on December 8, 2022 under 2022 legislation legalizing sports wagering in Massachusetts.  Under the 2022 legislation, Encore Boston Harbor is authorized to operate a sportsbook and is entitled to two individually branded mobile platforms. The initial term of the sports wagering licenses, which carries a $5,000,000.00 initial license fee, is 5 years.  Sports wagering licenses are also subject to additional regulatory fees.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts receives 15% of gross retail sports wagering revenues.   The MGC has responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the licensee and its officers, directors, employees and other designated persons. The MGC retains the authority to suspend, revoke or condition a Category 1 license, or any other license issued under the Massachusetts Act, and the IEB may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations. All licenses issued under the Massachusetts Act are expressly deemed a revocable privilege, conditioned on the licensee's fulfillment of all conditions of licensure, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the licensee's continuing qualification and suitability.\u00a0Among other things, the MGC is also responsible for the collection of application, license and other fees, conducting investigations of and monitoring applicants and licensees, and reviewing and ruling on complaints, and may conduct inspections of the gaming establishment premises or the licensee's records and equipment.  Pursuant to the Massachusetts Act, the MGC may grant a gaming beverage license for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages for a gaming establishment. The division of gaming liquor enforcement of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission has the authority to enforce, regulate and control the distribution of alcoholic beverages in a gaming establishment. The MGC may revoke, suspend, refuse to renew or refuse to transfer a gaming beverage license for violations of the Massachusetts Act that pertain to the sale and distribution of alcohol consumed on the premises and the regulations adopted by the MGC. The MGC has adopted regulations for the issuance of gaming beverage licenses. These regulations and any changes in applicable laws, regulations and procedures could have significant negative effects on our future Massachusetts gaming operations and results of operations.  Under the Massachusetts Gaming Act, the MGC is charged with \u201cestablishing the financial stability and integrity of gaming licensees, as well as the integrity of their sources of financing\u201d this includes the licensure or qualification of certain persons with a financial interest in a gaming licensee or in a gaming establishment. The Gaming Act requires licensure of anyone with a financial interest in a gaming establishment, or with a financial interest in the business of the gaming licensee or  14  14  14  Table of Contents Table of Contents  who is a close associate of a gaming licensee. While the Gaming Act and MGC\u2019s regulations contain exemptions for certain financial institutions and transactions, and generally focus on actual or beneficial ownership interests, the MGC retains significant discretion to require licensure of anyone with a financial interest in a gaming licensee or gaming establishment including any company holding over 15% of the licensee, or a holding, intermediary or subsidiary company of a licensee or of an individual that can exercise control or provide direction to a gaming licensee. Like its discretionary authority to require licensure, the MGC also has discretionary authority to grant a waiver from licensure to any person that cannot exercise control or provide direction to a gaming licensee or a holding, intermediary or subsidiary company thereof.  Certain transfer of interests in a Massachusetts gaming licensee or gaming establishment may require notice to the MGC and approval of any new person required to be licensed as a result of the transfer. A transfer of interest that also results in a change in control may require further review and approval by the MGC. No notice or approval is required for the open market transfer of less than five per cent interest in the holding company, parent or intermediary company of the licensee.  The granting of a security interest in a gaming license or gaming establishment to certain banking or commercial financial institutions in return for financing does not require prior notice or approval by the MGC.  Digital Sports Betting and Gaming  We and our partners are subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations that affect our digital sports betting and casino gaming businesses. The ownership, operation, and management of our digital sports betting and casino gaming business are subject to regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Additional laws in these areas may be passed in the future, which could result in impact to the ways in which we and our partners are able to offer interactive sports betting and casino gaming in jurisdictions that permit such activities.  Other Regulations  In addition to gaming regulations, we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
