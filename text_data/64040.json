Board Oversight & Management Implementation of Human Capital Strategy Our Board of Directors and Company management view effective human capital management as critical to the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategy.   As a result, the Board of Directors and the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee oversee and regularly engage with our CEO, Chief Purpose Officer, Chief Corporate Responsibility & Diversity Officer and other members of senior leadership on a broad range of people topics, including: culture and purpose; talent attraction and development; succession planning; compensation and benefits; diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DEI\"); workplace health, safety and well-being; and employee engagement and retention.   At the management level, our Chief Purpose Officer is responsible for leading the development and execution of the Company\u2019s human capital management strategy, also referred to as our \u201cPeople\u201d strategy, working together with other senior leaders across the Company.  Among other things, this includes promoting an inclusive and performance-driven workplace culture with equitable opportunity for all; managing the Company\u2019s initiatives to attract, develop, engage and retain the high-quality talent needed to ensure S&P Global is equipped with the right skillsets and intellectual capital to deliver on current and future business needs; and overseeing the design of the Company\u2019s compensation, benefits and well-being programs.

The Company\u2019s short-term incentive plan further reflects the significant role our people play in driving our enterprise strategy to Power Global Markets by linking executive pay outcomes under our enterprise and division balanced scorecards to the achievement of strategic people priorities. In 2022, we focused on delivering on the following strategic People priorities across the enterprise: \u2022Roll out and embed our new purpose and values across the combined company \u2022Encourage career mobility and career development through career coaching and Thrive, our performance management experience \u2022Improve diverse representation through hiring, advancement and retention, while continuing to raise awareness through DEI education \u2022Attract and retain our people through recognition programs, learning opportunities, and fair compensation 10 10 10 Table of Contents      Table of Contents      To achieve our strategic people objectives, we support our employees through human capital management strategies that include diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; learning and development programs; competitive compensation and benefits programs; hybrid work, benefits and well-being programs; and talent attraction, retention and engagement. Examples of some of our key initiatives and programs in these focus areas are included below.  Diversity, Equity & Inclusion  Our ability to attract and retain a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to our long-term strategy, driving business growth and innovation and empowering our people to achieve their full potential. In connection with our commitment to create a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, we have taken the following steps to foster an environment where our people can bring their whole selves to work:   \u2022An executive DEI Council, co-chaired by our CEO and Chief Purpose Officer, directs and oversees our enterprise-wide DEI strategy, advancing and ensuring coordination and accountability for DEI programs across the organization. In 2021, we also designed a new and improved DEI governance model for the larger combined organization following the close of the merger with IHS Markit to align on strategy and prioritization; improve connectivity and create a defined and well-coordinated feedback loop between the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, the executive DEI Council, Employee Resource Groups and People leaders; and enhance accountability.     \u2022We measure progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion programs as part of our enterprise and division balanced scorecards, which are reviewed by the CEO quarterly and the Board at least biannually, and impact short-term incentive compensation. Key Performance Indicators under our incentive scorecards for tracking and ensuring accountability for DEI progress include measuring the net change in the gender and racial/ethnic diversity of the S&P Global employee population and DEI specific sentiment through the annual VIBE employee engagement survey.    \u2022We connect colleagues across our organization through our Employee Resource Groups. These global and employee-led networks offer career experiences and network-building opportunities that foster professional development and support workplace diversity. \u2022To improve our pipeline of diverse talent, we have expanded our partnerships in diverse talent recruitment with select Historically Black Colleges and Universities, upgraded interview training to incorporate awareness of unconscious bias, and expanded career mentoring and leadership development opportunities for diverse colleagues. We are also including diversity and inclusion as an integral part of our Global Mobility strategy.

We provide a wide array of global training and learning programs to help employees expand their knowledge, skills and experience and guide career advancement, including:   \u2022Technology Training - We offer internal technology training programs to enhance the technology skills of our workforce and accelerate our ability to solve complex problems using a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithm development and technology education for all employees. \u2022Career Coaching - We launched a career coaching program, offering customized support through global career coaches, to empower people to take ownership of their career and help them navigate their career path and opportunities to grow within S&P Global. \u2022Leadership Development - We invest in developing leaders at all levels of our organization through targeted programs designed to foster leadership excellence in people managers, develop emerging leaders and strengthen our executive talent bench, providing a robust internal succession pipeline for our Executive Committee.  Competitive Compensation Programs  We believe compensation and recognition programs are critical to the overall people experience. Offering market competitive, people-centric and performance-driven compensation is key to our recruitment, talent management and retention strategies. As a result, management regularly assesses employee feedback, competitor research, and market data to ensure our programs remain competitive, equitable, and are designed with our people\u2019s financial and social well-being in mind. Based on these insights, each year we continue to introduce new and enhanced \u201cpeople first\u201d capabilities in support of our philosophy. Our compensation program consists of a mix of:  11 11 11 Table of Contents      Table of Contents      \u2022Annual Salary where base pay is determined by role, scope, external market rate and internal parity relative to geographic location.

In 2022, we broadened initiatives to increase pay transparency, empowering our people leaders to manage pay conversations in an effort to continue attracting and retaining top talent.  Hybrid Work, Benefits, and Well-being  The health, safety and well-being of our people working around the globe is a top priority, and our facilities worldwide follow rigorous, internally and externally audited, occupational health and safety policies.  In early 2022, most of our employees remained working from home and we introduced a new flexible return to office model via a phased approach called anchor-flex.  This model was not mandated as a full return, rather defining regular days our people might be in the office and those where they would work virtually.  Throughout, we continued to promote health, safety and the welfare of our people.  We focused on the well-being of our people aligned to our \u201cpeople first\u201d philosophy through expansion of our benefits offerings globally:  \u2022Recharge, flexible and unlimited time off to balance your work and life in order to maximize the effectiveness of both. \u2022Parental leave of 26 weeks to bond with new arrivals. \u202210 days of paid leave per calendar year to care for a close relative or loved one who has a serious illness or health condition. \u2022sick leave for a minimum of 10 business days or your local statutory timeframe.  \u2022flexible paid compassion leave following the loss of a loved one, based on individual needs and circumstances. \u2022three months\u2019 pay to family members following the loss of an employee.

Retention and Engagement  In order to attract and retain the high-quality talent needed to execute our long-term strategy of Powering Global Markets, we believe it is critical for our people to feel motivated and empowered. As a result, we strive to create a unified and inclusive workplace culture that promotes employee engagement, satisfaction and performance; and that reflects our common corporate purpose and values.   We invite employee feedback through a variety of channels for open communication and engagement, including small group employee round-table discussions with our business leaders and members of our Board of Directors, our annual VIBE employee engagement survey, as well as more frequent check-ins through employee \u201cPulse\u201d surveys. The annual VIBE survey allows us to track progress in critical areas, such as workplace pride and satisfaction and inclusive culture, and gather actionable insights for improvements to our people strategy. We encourage managers to share VIBE survey results with their teams, prioritize action areas and pursue solutions. To reinforce management accountability, we also track employee survey scores in our enterprise and division balanced scorecards, with outcomes against survey engagement targets impacting short-term incentive outcomes.  12 12 12 Table of Contents      Table of Contents       Available Information  S&P Global's investor relations website provides access to Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Proxy Statements, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, earnings releases and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
