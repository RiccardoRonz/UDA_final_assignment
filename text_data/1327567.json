As of July\u00a031, 2023, we had more than 7,100 channel partners. Global Customer Success. Our Global Customer Success (\u201cGCS\u201d) organization is responsible for delivering professional, educational, and support services directly to our channel partners and end-customers. We leverage the capabilities of our channel partners and train them in the delivery of professional, educational, and support services to enable these services to be locally delivered. We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products, and we have hired support engineers with proven experience to provide those services. - 10 - - 10 - - 10 - Table of Contents Table of Contents Marketing. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation and the market awareness of our portfolio and driving pipeline and end-customer demand. Our marketing team consists primarily of product marketing, brand, demand generation, field marketing, digital marketing, communications, analyst relations, and marketing analytics functions. Marketing activities include pipeline development through demand generation, social media and advertising programs, managing the corporate website and partner portal, trade shows and conferences, analyst relationships, customer advocacy, and customer awareness. Every year we organize multiple signature events, such as our end-customer conference \u201cIgnite\u201d and focused conferences such as \u201cCortex Symphony\u201d and \u201cSASE Converge.\u201d We also publish threat intelligence research, such as the Unit\u00a042 Cloud Threat Report and the Unit\u00a042 Network Threat Trends Research Report, which are based on data from our global threat intelligence team, Unit\u00a042. These activities and tools benefit both our direct and indirect channels and are available at no cost to our channel partners. Backlog. Orders for subscription and support offerings for multiple years are generally billed upfront upon fulfillment and are included in deferred revenue. Contract amounts that are not recorded in deferred revenue or revenue are considered backlog. We expect backlog related to subscription and support offerings will change from period to period for various reasons, including the timing and duration of customer orders and varying billing cycles of those orders. Products are billed upon hardware shipment or delivery of software license. The majority of our product revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. However, insufficient supply and inventory may delay our hardware product shipments. As such, we do not believe that our product backlog at any particular time is necessarily indicative of our future operating results. Seasonality. Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns. We have begun to see seasonal patterns in our business, which we expect to become more pronounced as we continue to grow, with our strongest sequential revenue growth generally occurring in our fiscal second and fourth quarters.  MANUFACTURING We outsource the manufacturing of our products to various manufacturing partners, which include our electronics manufacturing services provider (\u201cEMS provider\u201d) and original design manufacturers. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust more quickly to changing end-customer demand. Our EMS provider is Flextronics International,\u00a0Ltd. (\u201cFlex\u201d), who assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. The component parts within our products are either sourced by our manufacturing partners or by us from various component suppliers. Our manufacturing and supply contracts, generally, do not guarantee a certain level of supply or fixed pricing, which increases our exposure to supply shortages or price increases.  HUMAN CAPITAL We believe our ongoing success depends on our employees. Development and investment in our people is central to who we are, and will continue to be so. With a global workforce of 13,948 as of July\u00a031, 2023, our People Strategy is a critical element of our overall company strategy. Our People Strategy is a comprehensive approach to source, hire, onboard, develop, engage, and reward employees. Our approach is grounded on core tenants: respect each employee as an individual, demonstrate fairness and equity in all we do, facilitate flexibility, personalization, and choice whenever possible, and nurture a culture where employees are supported in doing the best work of their careers. Our values of disruption, execution, collaboration, inclusion, and integrity were co-created with employees and serve as the foundation of our culture. Source & Hire. Sourcing diverse talent who possess the skills and capabilities to execute and add value to our culture form the cornerstone of our comprehensive approach to talent acquisition\u2014a philosophy we call \u201cThe Way We Hire.\u201d We utilize an array of methods to identify subject matter experts in their respective fields, emphasizing sourcing channels that connect us with underrepresented talents. In an effort to foster career growth within Palo Alto Networks, we prioritize internal mobility. This allows current employees to progress either through a traditional career path or by exploring roles across various business functions, often culminating in promotions. We encourage existing employees to refer qualified individuals for our open positions, thus leveraging the collective networks of our team to attract a diverse range of expertise and perspectives. We have made strides to understand job requirements and implement structured interviewing practices to identify candidates of the highest quality. By conducting thorough job analyses and creating success profiles, we have developed a deeper understanding of what is required for success in critical roles. We equip our hiring managers with essential training to identify and mitigate potential unconscious biases. Our interviewing process emphasizes values and competencies that we believe enhance our culture. This commitment extends to conducting interviews with diverse panelists and providing a balanced evaluation and quality interview experience for a diverse slate of candidates. We remain steadfast in our commitment to fairness, bias reduction, and equal opportunities for all potential hires. - 11 - - 11 - - 11 - Table of Contents Table of Contents A key to our hiring process is the Global Hiring Committees, introduced in fiscal 2023. These committees play a significant role in elevating our hiring standards by promoting shared understanding, reducing biases, enhancing objectivity, and ensuring the recruitment of diverse talent. The Committees foster effective collaboration using a common language and consensus-driven decision-making. Onboard & Develop. We believe that each member of our workforce is unique, and that their integration into Palo Alto Networks and their career journey involve unique needs, interests, and goals. That is why our development programs are grounded on individualization, flexibility, and choice. From onboarding to ongoing development, our FLEXLearn philosophy offers multiple paths to assess, develop, and grow. Our onboarding experience starts with \u201cpre-boarding.\u201d Before an employee\u2019s start date, they are provided access to foundational tools to help them prepare to join Palo Alto Networks. We view pre-boarding as fundamental to introducing new employees to our culture, building trust, and facilitating rapid productivity. Welcome Day is a combination of in-person, virtual learning platforms and communication channels that provide new employees with inspirational, often personalized, onboarding experiences that carry on through the first year of employment. We have specialized learning tracks for interns and new graduates that have been recognized as best in class externally to support early-in-career individuals in acclimating to our culture as they progress on their career journey. As part of our merger and acquisition strategy, we have also established a robust integration program with the goal to enable individuals joining our teams to feel part of our culture at speed. Following onboarding, there are a variety of ways that employees can assess their interests and skills, build a development plan specific to those insights, and continue to grow. Our development initiatives are delivered to employees through a comprehensive platform, FLEXLearn. The platform contains curated content and programs, such as assessment instruments, thousands of courses, workshops, and mentoring and coaching services. Leaders and executives also have access to specialized learning tracks that help them strategize, mobilize, and deliver maximum personal and team performance. Employees have full agency to direct their growth at their pace and choosing. Development information about core business elements, working in a distributed hybrid environment, as well as required company-wide compliance training, such as Code of Conduct, privacy and security, anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, and anti-bribery training, is also deployed through the FLEXLearn platform for all employees. In addition, FLEXLearn provides employees with events and activities that motivate and spark critical thinking, on topics ranging from inclusion to well-being and collaboration. On average, employees had completed 33\u00a0hours of development through the FLEXLearn platform during fiscal 2023. Engage & Reward. We aim to foster engagement through a multifaceted approach to collect, understand, and act on employee feedback. Our comprehensive communication and listening strategy utilizes in-person and technology-enabled channels. We share and collect information through corporate and functional \u201cAll Hands\u201d meetings, including several meetings specifically focused on employee-centered topics in an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d format. Digital Displays across our sites, our intranet platform, monthly and weekly email communications, and an active Slack platform provide a regular flow of information to and between employees and leadership. In addition to these channels that reach large audiences, we conduct regular executive listening sessions, including small group convenings with our CEO and other C-suite leaders, and ad-hoc pulse surveys to better understand employee engagement, sentiment, well-being, and the ability to transition to a hybrid work model. Employee sentiment is also collected from external sources, such as web platforms that crowdsource feedback. Employees provide commentary to platforms such as Glassdoor, Comparably, and others and insights from those platforms are used to measure engagement. In addition, based on employee participation in an anonymous survey, the Best Practice Institute has certified Palo Alto Networks as a \u201cmost loved workplace\u201d (2021, 2022, and 2023). Palo Alto Networks has been recognized by Glassdoor, Comparably, Human Rights Campaign, Disability Index, and others as an employer of choice. Our CEO has also earned a 92% employee approval rating on Glassdoor, a top percentile score. In addition to a comprehensive compensation and diverse benefits program, we believe in an always-on feedback and rewards philosophy. From recurring 1:1\u00a0sessions, quarterly performance feedback, semi-annual performance reviews to use of our Cheers for Peers peer recognition program, employees get continuous input about the value they bring to the organization. These engagement and recognition strategies have informed our holistic People Strategy, including our Inclusion and Diversity (\u201cI&D\u201d) initiatives and Internal Mobility program. Based on the outcomes from external sources, insights from internal sources, our modest attrition rate (compared to market trends), and strong participation in our Internal Mobility program, we believe employees at Palo Alto Networks feel engaged and rewarded. Inclusion & Diversity. We are intentional about including diverse points of view, perspectives, experiences, backgrounds, and ideas in our decision-making processes. We deeply believe that true diversity exists when we have representation of all ethnicities, genders, orientations and identities, and cultures in our workforce. Our corporate I&D programs focus on five principles\u2014our workforce should feel psychologically safe, they should understand, listen, and support one another, and they should elevate others. These principles are the foundation of our approach to I&D, which we call P.U.L.S.E. - 12 - - 12 - - 12 - Table of Contents Table of Contents We have eleven employee network groups (\u201cENG\u201ds) that play a vital role in building understanding and awareness. Over 29% of our global workforce was involved in at least one ENG as of July\u00a031, 2023. ENGs are also allocated funding to make charitable grants to organizations advancing their causes. We involve our ENGs in listening sessions with executive teams and we work in partnership to develop our annual I&D plans because we believe involvement is\u00a0critical. Our I&D philosophy is fully embedded in our talent acquisition, learning and development, performance elevation, and rewards and recognition programs. The diversity of our board of directors, with women representing 40% of our board as of July\u00a031, 2023, is an example of our commitment to inclusion and diversity. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE We recognize our duty to address environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices. From our science-based approach to emissions reductions and our social impact programs to our Supplier Responsibility initiatives and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we value the opportunity to have meaningful outcomes that reinforce our intention to respect our planet, uplift our communities, and advance our industry. Environmental. We recognize climate change is a global crisis and are committed to doing our part to reduce environmental impacts. We remain committed to our goals of utilizing 100% renewable energy by 2030, reducing our greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions and working across our value chain, and with coalitions, to address climate change. We made progress towards our goals in fiscal 2023 through several milestones. We engaged with a local utility provider to power our Santa Clara, California headquarters with 100% renewable energy effective January\u00a01, 2023. Our near-term scope 1, 2, and 3\u00a0emissions reduction goals, aligned to a warming scenario of 1.5\u00b0\u00a0Celsius, were verified by the Science Based Targets initiative. We were recognized by Carbon Disclosure Project (\u201cCDP\u201d) as an \u201cA-List\u201d company and a \u201cSupplier Engagement Leader.\u201d We remain committed to being transparent about our progress over time through annual reporting. Social. In addition to our People Strategy described in the section titled \u201cHuman Capital\u201d above, we prioritized the health and safety of our global workforce. Through the deployment of our Global Supplier Code of Conduct, we continued to reach across our supply chain to communicate our expectations regarding labor standards, business practices, and workplace health and safety conditions. During fiscal 2023, we maintained our affiliate membership in the Responsible Business Alliance and maintained our commitment to Supplier Diversity. We value our role as a good corporate citizen and in fiscal 2023 continued to execute our social impact programs. We made charitable grants to support organizations providing services in our core funding areas of education, including academic scholarships, diversity, and basic needs. We expanded our work to provide cybersecurity curriculum to schools, universities, and nonprofit organizations to help individuals of all ages protect their digital way of life and to prepare diverse adults for careers in cybersecurity. Employees continued to participate in our giving, matching, and volunteer programs to make impacts in their local communities. Governance. Integrity is one of our core values. Our corporate behavior and leadership practices model ethical decision-making. All employees are informed about our governance expectations through our Codes of Conduct, compliance training programs, and ongoing communications. Our board of directors is governed by Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are amended from time to time to incorporate best practices in corporate governance. Reinforcing the importance of our ESG performance, the charter of the ESG and Nominating Committee of the board of directors includes the primary oversight of ESG.
