Evergy expects its 2023 Kansas and Missouri jurisdictional retail revenues to be approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, based on historical averages of Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's total retail revenues. See Item 7, MD&A, Critical Accounting Policies section, and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters. Competition  Missouri and Kansas continue to operate on the fully integrated and regulated retail utility model.  As a result, the Evergy Companies do not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in their franchised service territories in exchange for agreeing to have their terms of service regulated by state regulatory bodies.  If Missouri or Kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice, Evergy may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations, which may require a surcharge to recover certain costs from legacy customers or could lead to a write-off of certain regulatory assets and liabilities.       Evergy competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for retail customers in its service territory.  This competition primarily occurs within the SPP Integrated Marketplace, in which Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are participants.  This marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time for maximum regional cost-effectiveness.   The SPP Integrated Marketplace is similar to other RTO or Independent System Operator (ISO) markets currently operating in other regions of the United States. Power Supply Evergy has approximately 15,400 megawatts (MWs) of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements.  Evergy's owned generation and power purchases from others, as a percentage of total megawatt hours (MWhs) generated and purchased, was approximately 70% and 30%, respectively, over the last three years.  Evergy purchases power to meet its customers' needs, to satisfy firm power commitments or to meet renewable energy standards.  Management believes Evergy will be able to meet its future power purchase needs due to the coordination of planning and operations in the SPP region and existing power purchase agreements; however, price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand or reduced supply.   9 9 9 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Evergy's total capacity by fuel type, including both owned generating capacity and power purchase agreements, is detailed in the table below.

Includes owned generating capacity of 579 MWs and long-term power purchase agreements of approximately 3,747 MWs of wind generation that expire from 2028 through 2048.  See Item 2, Properties, for additional information. (b) Includes a long-term power purchase agreement for approximately 66 MWs of hydroelectric generation that expires in 2023. Evergy's projected peak summer demand for 2023 is approximately 10,200 MWs.  Evergy expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for 2023 with its existing generation assets and power purchases.  See \"Transitioning Evergy's Generation Fleet\" below for further information regarding Evergy's long-term strategy with regards to its generating assets and power purchases. Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are members of the SPP.  The SPP is a FERC-approved RTO with the responsibility to ensure reliable power supply, adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale electricity prices in the region.  As SPP members, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are required to maintain a minimum reserve margin of 15%.  This net positive supply of capacity is maintained through generation asset ownership, capacity agreements, power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs.  The reserve margin is designed to support reliability of the region's electric supply.   Environmental Matters The Evergy Companies are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality, waste management and hazardous substance disposal, protected natural resources (such as wetlands, endangered species and other protected wildlife) and health and safety.  For example, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West combust large amounts of fossil fuels in the production of electricity, which results in significant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG).  Federal legislation regulates the emission of GHGs and numerous states and regions have adopted programs to stabilize or reduce GHG emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act (CAA), water under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and waste management under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), among other laws and regulations. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  There have been, and management believes there will continue to be, policy, legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change, such as efforts to reduce GHG emissions, impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for low-carbon generation and energy efficiency.  These efforts, and climate change itself, have the potential to adversely affect the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information. The Evergy Companies have taken, and will continue to take, proactive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on its businesses.  For example, the Evergy Companies regularly conduct preparedness exercises for a variety of disruptive events, including storms, which may become more frequent or intense due to climate change.  In addition, the Evergy Companies have invested, and will continue to invest, in grid resiliency.  Much of the Evergy Companies' infrastructure is aged, and grid resiliency efforts include building additional transmission and distribution lines, replacing aged infrastructure and proactively managing the vegetation that can damage systems  10 10 10 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  during severe weather.  The Evergy Companies also monitor water conditions at their generating facilities and focus on water conservation at these facilities to address resource depletion. Transitioning Evergy's Generation Fleet The Evergy Companies are committed to a long-term strategy to reduce CO2 emissions in a cost-effective and reliable manner.  In 2022, Evergy achieved a reduction of CO2 emissions by nearly half from 2005 levels.  Evergy has a goal to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2045 with an interim goal of a 70% reduction of CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030.  The trajectory and timing of reaching the net-zero goal are dependent on many external factors, including enabling technology developments, the reliability of the power grid, availability of transmission capacity, supportive energy policies and regulations, and other factors.  See \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Certain Forward-Looking Information\" and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information. Public attention is currently focused on transitioning to a low carbon future, including reducing GHG emissions and closing coal-fired generating units.  Diversity of fuel supply has historically provided cost and reliability benefits.  For example, because renewable generation is intermittent, diversity of baseload generation, including a mix of coal and natural gas, has helped to maintain a consistent availability of power.  In addition, the Evergy Companies must prudently utilize the generation assets that regulators have allowed the Evergy Companies to include in rates.  The Evergy Companies use a triennial integrated resource plan, which is a detailed analysis that estimates factors that influence the future supply and demand for electricity, to inform the manner in which they supply electricity.  The integrated resource plan considers forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, cost of environmental compliance, integration of renewables, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response initiatives.  Strategies that the Evergy Companies are pursuing to reduce emissions include: \u2022retiring fossil fuel generation; \u2022developing renewable energy facilities; \u2022collaborating with regulators to offer customers the opportunity to procure electricity produced with renewable resources; and  \u2022investing in customer energy efficiency programs. Since 2005, the Evergy Companies have added over 4,400 MWs of renewable generation, while retiring more than 2,400 MWs of fossil generation.  See Item 2, Properties, for additional information regarding the Evergy Companies' renewable generation resources.  The Evergy Companies are also committed to transparency.  On its website, http://investors.evergy.com, Evergy provides quantitative and qualitative data regarding various environmental, social and governance matters, including information related to emissions, waste and water.  The contents of the website, including reports and documents contained therein, are not incorporated into this filing. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters. 11 11 11 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Fuel The fuel sources for Evergy's owned generation and power purchase agreements are coal, wind and other renewable sources, uranium and natural gas and oil.

Coal During 2023, Evergy's generating units, including jointly-owned units, are projected to use approximately 17 million tons of coal.  Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have entered into coal-purchase contracts with various suppliers in Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB), the nation's principal supply region of low-sulfur coal, and with local suppliers.  The coal to be provided under these contracts is expected to satisfy approximately 65%, 15% and 5% of the projected coal requirements for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.  The remainder of the coal requirements is expected to be fulfilled through entering into additional contracts or spot market purchases.  Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the PRB and local suppliers to their generating units.  The transportation services to be provided under these contracts are expected to satisfy almost all of the projected transportation requirements for 2023, 2024 and 2025.  The contract rates adjust for changes in railroad costs.   Nuclear Fuel Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro each owns 47% of Wolf Creek, which is Evergy's only nuclear generating unit.  Wolf Creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor.  This process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies.  The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract all the uranium, uranium enrichment and conversion services needed to operate Wolf Creek through the first quarter of 2030.  The owners also have under contract all the uranium fabrication services required to operate Wolf Creek through 2045. Natural Gas Evergy purchases natural gas for use in its generating units primarily through spot market purchases.  From time to time, Evergy also may enter into contracts, including the use of derivatives, in an effort to manage the cost of natural gas.  For additional information about Evergy's exposure to commodity price risks, see Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West maintain natural gas transportation arrangements with Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc.  The Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. arrangement expires based on the generating unit being served with expiration dates from 2023 to 2030.   12 12 12 Table of Contents  Table of Contents  Customer Energy Efficiency Programs The Evergy Companies have implemented, and continue to offer, energy efficiency programs to help customers with their energy efficiency needs and to help manage energy costs.  Both Missouri and Kansas have passed legislation promoting the implementation of cost-effective demand-side management programs and allowing for the recovery of these program costs from customers, along with the potential to earn performance incentives based upon certain criteria. In Missouri, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West currently offer a suite of energy efficiency programs for customers under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA).  The current portfolio of programs was approved by the MPSC in 2019 for the years 2020 through 2022 and provides for the recovery of program costs, throughput disincentive and the opportunity to earn a performance incentive based upon demand and energy savings achieved.  The costs of the programs are recovered from customers through a rider mechanism.  Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West requested an extension of these programs and in May 2022 the MPSC approved the extension through 2023.  In Kansas, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro requested KCC authorization in December 2021 for a suite of energy efficiency programs for customers under the Kansas Energy Efficiency Investment Act (KEEIA).  The requested portfolio of programs would provide for the recovery of program costs, throughput disincentive and the opportunity to earn a performance incentive based upon demand and energy savings achieved.  The costs of the program would be recovered from customers through a rider mechanism.  Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's proposed programs would be effective in 2023 through 2026.  The KCC's decision on Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's KEEIA request is expected in the first half of 2023. Human Capital Resources At December\u00a031, 2022, the Evergy Companies had 4,512 employees, including 2,406 represented by five local unions of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and one local union of the United Government Security Officers of America (UGSOA).
