Overview of Business  YUM has over 55,000 restaurants in more than 155 countries and territories primarily operating under the four concepts of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and The Habit Burger Grill (the \u201cConcepts\u201d). The Company\u2019s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands are global leaders of the chicken, Mexican-style food and pizza categories, respectively. The Habit Burger Grill is a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in made-to-order chargrilled burgers, sandwiches and more. At December\u00a031, 2022, 98% of our Concepts\u2019 units are operated by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements.

See further discussion of this performance metric within Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  KFC  KFC was founded in Corbin, Kentucky, by Colonel Harland D. Sanders, an early developer of the quick service food business and a pioneer of the restaurant franchise concept. The Colonel perfected his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices for Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1939 and signed up his first franchisee in 1952. KFC restaurants across the world offer fried and non-fried chicken products such as sandwiches, chicken strips, chicken-on-the-bone and other chicken products marketed under a variety of names.   Taco Bell  The first Taco Bell restaurant was opened in 1962 by Glen Bell in Downey, California, and in 1964, the first Taco Bell franchise was sold. Taco Bell specializes in Mexican-style food products, including various types of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, salads, nachos and other related items.  Pizza Hut  The first Pizza Hut restaurant was opened in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, and within a year, the first franchise unit was opened. Today, Pizza Hut specializes in the sale of ready-to-eat pizza products and operates in the delivery, carryout and casual dining segments around the world.  3 3 3    Habit Burger Grill  The first Habit Burger Grill restaurant opened in 1969 in Santa Barbara, California. The Habit Burger Grill restaurant concept is built around a distinctive and diverse menu that includes chargrilled burgers and sandwiches made-to-order over an open flame and topped with fresh ingredients.  Business Strategy  Through our Recipe for Good Growth we intend to unlock the growth potential of our Concepts and YUM, drive increased collaboration across our Concepts and geographies and consistently deliver better customer experiences, improved unit economics and higher rates of growth. Key enablers include accelerated use of digital and technology and better leverage of our systemwide scale.  Our global citizenship and sustainability strategy is reflected in our Good agenda, which includes our priorities for social responsibility, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and planet.\u00a0\u00a0   Our Growth agenda is based on four key drivers: \u2022Unrivaled Culture and Talent: Leverage our culture and people capability to fuel brand performance and franchise success \u2022Unmatched Operating Capability: Recruit and equip the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences \u2022Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands: Innovate and elevate iconic restaurant brands people trust and champion \u2022Bold Restaurant Development: Drive market and franchise expansion with strong economics and value  Information about Operating Segments  As of December\u00a031, 2022, YUM consists of four operating segments:\u00a0\u00a0  \u2022The KFC Division which includes our worldwide operations of the KFC concept \u2022The Taco Bell Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Taco Bell concept \u2022The Pizza Hut Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Pizza Hut concept \u2022The Habit Burger Grill Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Habit Burger Grill concept  Franchise Agreements  The franchise programs of the Company are designed to promote consistency and quality, and the Company is selective in granting franchises. The Company is focused on partnering with franchisees who have the commitment, capability and capitalization to grow our Concepts. Franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publicly-traded companies. The Company has franchise relationships that are particularly important to our business, such as our relationship with Yum China (defined below) and our relationships with certain other large franchisees.  The Company has successfully increased franchise restaurant ownership in recent years, and currently has approximately 1,500 franchisees with whom we have franchise contracts. The Company utilizes both store-level franchise and master franchise programs to grow our businesses. Of our over 54,000 franchised units at December\u00a031, 2022, approximately 35% operate under our master franchise programs, including nearly 12,100 units in mainland China. The remainder of our franchise units operate under store-level franchise agreements. Under both types of franchise programs, franchisees supply capital by purchasing or leasing the land, building, equipment, signs, seating, inventories and supplies and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the business. In certain historical refranchising transactions the Company may have retained ownership of land and building and continues to lease them to the franchisee. Store-level franchise agreements typically require payment to the Company of certain upfront fees such as initial fees paid upon opening of a store, fees paid to renew the term of the franchise agreement and fees paid in the event the franchise agreement is transferred to another franchisee. Franchisees also pay monthly continuing fees based on a percentage of their restaurants\u2019 sales (typically between 4% to 6%) and are required to spend a certain amount to advertise and promote the brand. Under master franchise arrangements, the Company enters into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate restaurants as well as sub-franchise restaurants within certain geographic territories. Master franchisees are typically responsible for overseeing development within their territories and performing certain other administrative duties with regard to the oversight of sub-franchisees. In exchange, master franchisees retain a certain percentage of fees payable by the sub-franchisees under their franchise agreements and typically pay lower fees for the restaurants they operate.   4 4 4   On October 31, 2016, we completed the spin-off of our China business into an independent, publicly-traded company under the name of  Yum China Holdings, Inc. (\u201cYum China\u201d). As our largest master franchisee, Yum China, pays the Company a continuing fee of 3% on system sales of our Concepts in mainland China. The use by Yum China of certain of our material trademarks and service marks is governed by a master license agreement between Yum Restaurants Consulting (Shanghai) Company Limited, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Yum China, and YUM, through YRI China Franchising LLC, a subsidiary of YUM.  The Company seeks to maintain strong and open relationships with our franchisees and their representatives. To this end, the Company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business, including products, technology, equipment, operational improvements and standards.   Restaurant Operations  Through its Concepts, YUM develops, operates and franchises a worldwide system of both traditional and non-traditional Quick Service Restaurants (\u201cQSR\u201d). Traditional units can feature dine-in, carryout, drive-thru and delivery services. Non-traditional units include express units that have a more limited menu, usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in non-traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, train stations, subways, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient.  Most restaurants in each Concept offer consumers the ability to dine in, carryout and/or have the Concepts\u2019 food delivered either through store-level or third-party delivery services. In addition, Taco Bell and KFC offer a drive-thru option in many stores. Pizza Hut and Habit Burger Grill offer a drive-thru option on a much more limited basis.\u00a0\u00a0  Restaurant management structure varies by Concept, unit size and franchise organization. Generally, each restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager (\u201cRGM\u201d), together with one or more assistant managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. Each Concept issues manuals, which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs.  These manuals set forth standards and requirements for restaurant operations, including food safety and quality, food handling and product preparation procedures, equipment maintenance, facility standards and accounting control procedures. Each franchise organization and their respective restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each unit, including all matters related to employment of restaurant staff, and for ensuring compliance with operating standards.   We have accelerated our deployment of digital and technology initiatives to enhance the customer experience and our off-premise capabilities. This includes increasing our focus on driving digital sales where customers utilize ordering interaction that is primarily facilitated by automated technology. In 2022, our system restaurants generated digital sales of $24 billion and over 47,000 restaurants now offer delivery, which represents approximately 85% of our global system. Delivery can be provided through either a delivery system owned and operated by our restaurants or through third-party delivery companies such as aggregators.  The Company and its Concepts own numerous registered trademarks. The Company believes that many of these marks, including our Kentucky Fried Chicken\u00ae, KFC\u00ae, Taco Bell\u00ae, Pizza Hut\u00ae and The Habit\u00ae marks, have significant value and material importance to our business. The Company\u2019s policy is to pursue registration of important marks whenever feasible and to challenge any infringement of our marks vigorously. The use of certain of these marks by franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements.\u00a0\u00a0Under current law and with proper use, the Company\u2019s rights in our marks can generally last indefinitely.\u00a0\u00a0The Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment and technology which, while valuable, are not currently considered material to our business.  Supply and Distribution  The Company and franchisees of the Concepts are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products, equipment and other restaurant supplies. The principal items purchased include chicken, cheese, beef and pork products, paper and packaging materials.  Prices paid for these supplies fluctuate.\u00a0\u00a0When prices increase, the Concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers, although there is no assurance that this can be done in practice.  The Company does not typically experience significant continuous shortages of supplies, and alternative sources for most of these supplies are generally available.\u00a0\u00a0  In the U.S., the Company, along with the representatives of the Company\u2019s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut franchisee groups, are members of Restaurant Supply Chain Solutions, LLC (\u201cRSCS\u201d), a third party which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, The Habit Burger Grill entered into a purchasing agreement with RSCS effective July 31, 2020.  The core mission of RSCS is to provide the lowest possible sustainable store-delivered prices for  5 5 5   restaurant products and equipment.\u00a0\u00a0This arrangement combines the purchasing power of the Company-owned and franchisee restaurants, which the Company believes leverages the system\u2019s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function.\u00a0\u00a0The Company also believes that RSCS fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with our franchisee community.  Most food products, paper and packaging supplies, and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by third-party distribution companies.\u00a0 In the U.S., McLane Foodservice, Inc. is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in Company-owned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee restaurants.\u00a0 Outside the U.S., we and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global, regional and local suppliers and distributors.\u00a0 Our international franchisees generally select and manage their own third-party suppliers and distributors, subject to our internal standards.  All suppliers and distributors are expected to provide products and/or services that comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the state and/or country in which they operate as well as comply with our internal standards.  Advertising and Promotional Programs  Company-owned and franchise restaurants are required to spend a percentage of their respective restaurants\u2019 sales on advertising programs with the goal of increasing sales and enhancing the reputation of the Concepts. Advertising may be conducted nationally, regionally and locally.  When multiple franchisees operate in the same country or region, the national and regional advertising spending is typically conducted by a cooperative to which the franchisees and Company-owned restaurants, if any, contribute funds as a percentage of restaurants\u2019 sales. The contributions are primarily used to pay for expenses relating to purchasing media for advertising, market research, commercial production, talent payments and other support functions for the respective Concepts. We have the right to control the advertising activities of certain advertising cooperatives, typically in markets where we have Company-owned restaurants, through our majority voting rights.  Working Capital  Information about the Company\u2019s working capital is included in MD&A in Part II, Item 7 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part II, Item 8.  Seasonal Operations  The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.  Competition  The retail food industry, in which our Concepts compete, is made up of supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse stores, convenience stores, coffee shops, snack bars, delicatessens and restaurants (including those in the QSR segment), and is intensely competitive with respect to price and quality of food products, new product development, digital engagement, advertising levels and promotional initiatives, customer service reputation, restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties.  Competition has also increased from and been enabled by delivery aggregators and other food delivery services in recent years, particularly in urbanized areas.  Our Concepts also face competition as a result of convergence in grocery, convenience, deli and restaurant services, including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals, including pizzas and entrees with side dishes.  The retail food industry is often affected by: changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing food retailers and products; and disposable purchasing power.\u00a0\u00a0Within the retail food industry, each of our Concepts competes with international, national and regional chains as well as locally-owned establishments, not only for customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.\u00a0\u00a0Given the various types and vast number of competitors, our Concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales, either on a worldwide or individual country basis.  Environmental Matters  The Company is not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures.\u00a0\u00a0However, the Company cannot predict the effect on our operations due to possible future environmental legislation or regulations.\u00a0\u00a0During 2022, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.  6 6 6   Government Regulation  U.S. Operations. \u00a0The Company and its U.S. operations, as well as our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business, including laws and regulations concerning information security, privacy, labor and employment, health, marketing, food labeling, competition, public accommodation, sanitation and safety.\u00a0\u00a0Each of our and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 restaurants in the U.S. must comply with licensing requirements and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, sanitation, safety, fire and zoning agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, each Concept must comply with various state and federal laws that regulate the franchisor/franchisee relationship.\u00a0\u00a0To date, the Company has not been materially adversely affected by such licensing requirements and regulations or by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.  International Operations.\u00a0\u00a0Our and our Concepts\u2019 franchisees\u2019 restaurants outside the U.S. are subject to national and local laws and regulations which have similarities to those affecting U.S. restaurants but may differ among jurisdictions.\u00a0\u00a0The restaurants outside the U.S. are also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment, laws regulating foreign investment and anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.\u00a0\u00a0  See Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.  Human Capital Management  Overview  As of December\u00a031, 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 36,000 persons, including approximately 23,000 employees in the U.S. and approximately 13,000 employees outside the U.S. Approximately 85% of our employees work in restaurants while the remainder work in our restaurant-support centers. In the U.S., approximately 90% of our Company-owned restaurant employees are part-time and approximately 50% have been employed by the Company for less than a year.  Some of our International employees are subject to labor council relationships whose terms vary due to the diverse countries in which the Company operates.  In addition to the persons employed by the Company and its subsidiaries, our approximately 54,000 franchise restaurants around the world are responsible for the employment of over an estimated 1 million people who work in and support those restaurants. Each year YUM and our franchisees around the world create thousands of restaurant jobs, which are part-time, entry-level opportunities to grow careers at our KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and The Habit Burger Grill brands.  As evidence of the opportunities these positions create, approximately 80% of the Company-owned Restaurant General Managers (\u201cRGMs\u201d) located in the U.S. have been promoted from other positions in our brands\u2019 restaurants and such RGMs often earn pay greater than the average American household income.  Human capital management considerations are integral to our Recipe for Good Growth strategy, the drivers of which include leveraging our culture and people capability to fuel brand performance and franchise success, as well as recruiting and equipping the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences. Our investment in people includes creating a culture of engagement that attracts, retains and grows the best people and creates high performance in our restaurants. We are also highly focused on building an inclusive culture among our employees, franchisees, suppliers and partners to reflect the diversity of our customers and communities. Our commitments and progress towards executing this strategy are reflected below.  Culture & Talent  We believe that our culture and talent provide us with a competitive advantage with respect to the performance of our business.  Our areas of focus in this regard include the following:  \u2022Measuring YUM employee engagement regularly. For example, every other year we conduct a global employee engagement survey of all employees working in our restaurant support centers. The most recent survey conducted was in 2021 and reflected an engagement level among our employees significantly exceeding the average engagement levels of benchmarked companies.   \u2022Providing YUM employees with training and development that builds world-class leaders and drives business results.  We promote these efforts through initiatives such as our leadership development program (Heartstyles), our unconscious bias program (Inclusive Leadership) and training programs with respect to our compliance polices,  7 7 7   including our Code of Conduct. Our Heartstyles program is also available to our franchisees so that their employees may benefit as well.  \u2022Enabling a culture that fuels results and cross-brand collaboration on operational execution, people capability and customer experience initiatives throughout our system.  \u2022Assessing progress towards lowering turnover and increasing retention rates, particularly at the restaurant-employee level.  Equity, Inclusion & Belonging  In connection with our focus on equity, inclusion and belonging, our areas of focus include the following:  \u2022Continually building upon ongoing inclusion efforts to help ensure our workplaces are environments where all people can be successful.    \u2022Consistent with our Code of Conduct, making employment-related decisions based on an individual\u2019s abilities and merit, not personal characteristics that are unrelated to the job.  \u2022Significantly increasing the number of women in our senior leadership globally, with a goal of achieving gender parity by 2030.  In 2021, approximately 42% of our global corporate leadership roles were held by women and approximately 51% of our global workforce were women.    \u2022Increasing representation of underrepresented U.S. associates among our executive and management ranks, franchisees and suppliers over the next 10 years to achieve our aspirational goals to be representative of our customers and communities. Through our membership with the OneTen coalition, we are partnering with a group of U.S. businesses to create career mobility and advancement opportunities for underrepresented people and communities.  \u2022Continuing to make Inclusive Leadership training and anti-racism training available across our system. We intend to expand our Inclusive Leadership training to employees and franchisees around the world and have started development of an online module of this training program to help provide even greater access.
