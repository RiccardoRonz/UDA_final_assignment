O\u2019Reilly and his son, Charles H. \u201cChub\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Reilly,\u00a0Sr., and initially operated from a single store in Springfield, Missouri. Our common stock has traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cORLY\u201d since April\u00a022, 1993. \u200b At December\u00a031,\u00a02022, we operated 5,929 stores in 47 states in the United States and 42 stores in Mexico. \u00a0Our stores carry an extensive product line, including  \u200b Our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers, such as  \u200b See the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this annual report on Form\u00a010-K for a description of certain risks relevant to our business. \u00a0These risk factors include, among others, risks related to deteriorating economic conditions, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products, business interruptions, failure to protect our brand and reputation, risks associated with international operations, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, our increased debt levels, a downgrade in our credit ratings, future growth assurance, our dependence upon key personnel, our acquisition strategies, information and systems security, damage and failure, and litigation, environmental legislation and other regulations. \u200b OUR BUSINESS \u200b Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy. \u00a0We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O\u2019Reilly values, including hard work, superior customer service and expense control. \u00a0Our mission is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both DIY and professional service provider customers. \u200b Competitive Advantages \u200b We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution network and experienced management Team make up our key competitive advantages, which cannot be easily duplicated.  \u200b 5 5  \u200bProven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy:For more than 40 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers. \u00a0We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage. \u00a0The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers, capitalizing on our existing store and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers.\u200bIn 2022, we derived approximately 56% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 44% of our sales from our professional service provider customers. \u00a0Historically, we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation. \u00a0We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business, due to our systems, knowledge, industry-leading parts availability and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, augmented by our approximately 725 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer. \u00a0We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets.\u200bSuperior Customer Service:We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products. \u00a0We believe the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the correct automotive products needed to complete their repairs. \u00a0Accordingly, each O\u2019Reilly store carries, or has same or next day availability to, a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications. \u00a0We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management\u2019s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace. \u00a0We have no material backorders for the products we sell.\u200bWe seek to

People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators. \u00a0We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard part repairs, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis. \u00a0Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People. \u00a0See

and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network. \u00a0Our strategic, regional, tiered distribution network includes distribution centers (\u201cDCs\u201d) and Hub stores. \u00a0Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management. \u00a0We currently operate 28 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 154,000 stock keeping units (\u201cSKUs\u201d), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers. \u00a0To augment our robust distribution network, we operate a total of 383 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to stores within the surrounding areas to an average of 49,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 94,000 SKUs. \u00a0More than 95% of our stores receive multiple same-day deliveries and deliveries on weekends of hard to find parts from our DCs and Hub stores. \u00a0We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business. \u200bExperienced Management Team:Our Company philosophy is to \u201cpromote from within,\u201d and the vast majority of our senior managers, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company. \u00a0We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, technical proficiency or subject matter expertise. \u00a0We have a strong management Team that has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 30 consecutive\u00a0years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April\u00a0of 1993. \u00a0See our \u201cTeam Members and Human Capital Management\u201d disclosure of the \u201cBusiness\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about our experienced management Team.\u200bGrowth Strategy\u200bAggressively Open New Stores:We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket. \u00a0During 2022, we opened 170 net, new domestic stores and 17 new stores in Mexico. \u00a0In 2023, we plan to open 180 to 190 net, new stores, which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets. \u00a0The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O\u2019Reilly stores. \u00a0We typically open new stores by(i)constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory;(ii)acquiring an independently owned auto parts store (\u201cjobber store\u201d), typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store; or(iii)purchasing multi-store chains.\u200bNew store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution. \u00a0Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, vehicles in operation, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius.\u200bWe target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network. \u00a0While we have, and continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets. \u00a0We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. \u00a0Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.\u200bGrow Sales in Existing Stores:Profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy. \u00a0To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O\u2019Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers. \u00a0We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service, that generates sustainable increased sales and profitability.\u200b7 \u200b \u200b Strategic Regional Tiered Distribution

improve the service provided to our customers. \u00a0We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service, that generates sustainable increased sales and profitability. \u200b 7 7  \u200bSelectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions:The automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, like O\u2019Reilly, to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation. \u00a0Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new domestic and international markets.\u200bContinually Enhance Store Design and Location:Our current prototype store design features optimized square footage, high ceilings, convenient interior store layouts, in-store signage, multilingual signage, bright lighting, convenient ingress and egress, ample parking and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies to enhance overall customer service. \u00a0We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance. \u00a0During 2022, while experiencing macroeconomic constraints to construction timing and the supply of material and equipment, we relocated 11 stores and performed minor to major updates or renovations to approximately 1,300 additional stores. \u00a0We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best attract and serve our customers. \u00a0\u200bOmnichannel Growth Strategy:Our Omnichannel growth strategies reflect the continued evolution of customer preferences in researching and completing purchases. \u00a0More than ever before, our customers\u2019 purchase decisions are informed by a range of interactions, whether in-person, over the phone, or through a variety of digital channels, as they seek to find the professional parts knowledge and the product availability they need to meet their

complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores, and additional penetration into existing markets, in the regions surrounding each DC. \u00a0As of December\u00a031,\u00a02022, we had a total growth capacity of 150 to 300 U.S. stores in our distribution network. \u00a0Further enhancing our distribution capabilities in 2023, we plan to open our

operating square feet (see the \u201cProperties\u201d table in Item\u00a02 of this annual report on Form\u00a010-K for more information about DC operating square footages). \u00a0Our DCs stock an average of 154,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have access to multiple other regional DCs\u2019 inventory. \u00a0Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to substantially all of our stores in the continental United States. \u00a0In addition, stores within an individual DC\u2019s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC\u2019s \u201ccity counter,\u201d many of which receive this service seven\u00a0days per week. \u00a0Our DCs provide service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute products to surrounding stores. \u00a0Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.\u200bAs part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2023, we plan to\u25cfcontinue to enhance our distribution network through the engineering, design, expansion or relocation of new or current DCs;\u25cfcontinue to utilize routing software to enhance logistics efficiencies;\u25cfcontinue to implement labor management software to improve DC productivity and overall operating efficiency;\u25cfcontinue to define and implement best practices in all DCs; \u25cfmake proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs, including conveyor systems, picking modules, lift equipment and computer hardware; and \u25cfcontinue to augment our robust distribution network, when and where appropriate, through the use of strategically located Hubs. \u00a0\u200bHub Stores:We currently operate a total of 383 strategically located Hub stores. \u00a0In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis. \u00a0Our Hub store network consists of 383 Hubs that average approximately 12,700 square feet and carry an average of 49,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 94,000 SKUs.\u200bProducts and Purchasing\u200bOur stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks. \u00a0Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products, such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, Castrol, Dorman, Fel-Pro, Gates Rubber, Lucas Oil, Mobil1, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Standard, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix, and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products, which span the entire good, better

exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary bands, which we have acquired or developed over time. \u00a0Our \u201cgood\u201d proprietary brands provide a great combination of quality and value, a characteristic important to our DIY customers, while our \u201cbetter\u201d and \u201cbest\u201d proprietary brands offer options for our more heavy-duty DIY customers, as well as our professional service provider customers, who often prefer higher quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses.\u200bWe have no long-term contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts. \u00a0We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell. \u00a0It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers. \u00a0We have entered into various programs 12 \u200b
