{"cik": 63754, "item_1A": "ITEM\u00a01. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. We manufacture, market and distribute spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry\u2013retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. On December 30, 2020, we completed the purchase of FONA International, LLC and certain of its affiliates (FONA), a privately held company. The purchase price was approximately $708 million, net of cash acquired. FONA is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food, beverage and nutritional markets. The acquisition of FONA broadens our value-add offerings with products that are highly complementary to our existing portfolio. By combining the portfolios and infrastructures, we have added manufacturing capacity as well as greater scale and expect to accelerate our global flavor growth. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of FONA were approximately $114 million. The results of FONA\u2019s operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our flavor solutions segment from the date of acquisition.  On November 30, 2020, we completed the purchase of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce\u00ae (Cholula) from L Catterton. The purchase price was approximately $801 million, net of cash acquired. Cholula, a premium Mexican hot sauce brand, is a strong addition to our global branded flavor portfolio, which broadens our offerings in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic Mexican flavor hot sauce. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of Cholula were approximately $96 million. The results of Cholula\u2019s operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition. Business Segments  We operate in two business segments, consumer and flavor solutions. Demand for flavor is growing globally, and across both segments we have the customer base and product breadth to participate in all types of eating occasions. Our products deliver flavor when cooking at home, dining out, purchasing a quick service meal or enjoying a snack. We offer our customers and consumers a range of products, extending from premium to value-priced, to meet the increasing demand for certain product attributes such as clean-label, organic, natural, reduced sodium, gluten-free and non-GMO (genetically modified organisms).  Consistent with market conditions in each segment, our consumer segment has a higher overall profit margin than our flavor solutions segment. In 2022, the consumer segment contributed approximately 59% of consolidated net sales and 80% of consolidated operating income, and the flavor solutions segment contributed approximately 41% of consolidated net sales and 20% of consolidated operating income. Consumer Segment. From locations around the world, our brands reach consumers in approximately 160 countries and territories. Our leading brands in the Americas include McCormick\u00ae, French\u2019s\u00ae, Frank\u2019s RedHot\u00ae, Lawry\u2019s\u00ae Cholula Hot Sauce\u00ae and Club House\u00ae, as well as brands such as Gourmet Garden\u00ae and OLD BAY\u00ae. We also market authentic regional and ethnic brands such as Zatarain\u2019s\u00ae, Stubb's\u00ae, Thai Kitchen\u00ae and Simply Asia\u00ae. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, our major brands include the Ducros\u00ae, Schwartz\u00ae, Kamis\u00ae and La Drogheria\u00ae brands of spices, herbs and seasonings and an extensive line of Vahin\u00e9\u00ae brand dessert items. In China, we market our products under the McCormick and DaQiao\u00ae brands. In Australia, we market our spices and seasonings under the McCormick brand, our dessert products under the Aeroplane\u00ae brand, and packaged chilled herbs under the Gourmet Garden brand. Elsewhere in the Asia/Pacific region, we market our products under the McCormick brand as well as other brands. Approximately two thirds of our consumer segment sales are spices and seasonings and condiments and sauces. Within the spices and seasoning category, we are the brand leader globally and a category leader in our key markets. In the condiments and sauces category, we are one of the brand leaders globally and in the U.S. There  2 2 2   are numerous competitive brands of spices and seasonings, and condiments and sauces in the U.S. and additional brands in international markets. Some are owned by large food manufacturers, while others are supplied by small privately-owned companies. In this competitive environment, we are leading with innovation and brand marketing, and applying our analytical tools to help customers optimize the profitability of their sales of these categories while simultaneously working to increase our sales and profit. Our customers span a variety of retailers that include grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores, and e-commerce retailers, served directly and indirectly through distributors or wholesalers. In addition to marketing our branded products to these customers, we are also a leading supplier of private label items, also known as store brands. In our businesses in China and, prior to 2022, India, foodservice sales are managed by and reported in our consumer segment. Flavor Solutions Segment. In our flavor solutions segment, we provide a wide range of products to multinational food manufacturers and foodservice customers. The foodservice customers are supplied with branded, packaged products both directly by us and indirectly through distributors, with the exception of our businesses in China and, prior to 2022, India, where foodservice sales are managed by and reported in our consumer segment. We supply food manufacturers and foodservice customers with customized flavor solutions, and many of these customer relationships have been active for decades. Our range of flavor solutions remains one of the broadest in the industry and includes seasoning blends, spices and herbs, condiments, coating systems and compound flavors. In addition to a broad range of flavor solutions, our long-standing customer relationships are evidence of our effectiveness in building customer intimacy. Our customers benefit from our expertise in many areas, including sensory testing, culinary research, food safety and flavor application. Our flavor solutions segment has a number of competitors. Some tend to specialize in a particular range of products and have a limited geographic reach. Other competitors include large publicly held flavor companies that are more global in nature, but which also tend to focus on providing integrated solutions extending beyond flavor through the use of other functional and nutritional ingredients. Raw Materials The most significant raw materials used in our business are dairy products, pepper, onion, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), garlic, wheat products, vegetable oils, and vanilla. Pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the United States. Other raw materials, like dairy products and onion, are primarily sourced locally, either within the United States or from our international locations. Because these raw materials are agricultural products, they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, including inflationary cost increases, and other factors beyond our control.  We respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, customer price adjustments and cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. There has been, and there could continue to be, a difference between the timing of when these customer price adjustments and cost savings impact our results of operations and when the impact of cost inflation occurs. Additionally, in some instances the pricing actions we take have been impacted by price elasticity which unfavorably impacts our sales volume and mix. In addition, we rely on third-party transportation providers to deliver raw materials as well as our products to our customers. Reduced availability of transportation capacity due to labor shortages and higher fuel costs has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers. Customers Our products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers, wholesalers and distributors. In the consumer segment, products are then sold to consumers under a number of brands through a variety of retail channels, including grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores, and e-commerce. In the flavor solutions segment, products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by foodservice customers as ingredients for menu items, as well as provided to their own customers for use in dine-in and take-out eating occasions, all to enhance the flavor of their foods. Customers for the flavor solutions segment include food manufacturers and the foodservice industry supplied through a variety of channels including directly and indirectly through distributors, wholesale foodservice suppliers and e-commerce. We have a large number of customers for our products. Sales to one of our consumer segment customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 12% of consolidated sales in 2022, 11% of consolidated sales in 2021 and 12% of consolidated sales in 2020. Sales to one of our flavor solutions segment customers, PepsiCo, Inc.,  3 3 3   accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the top three customers in our flavor solutions segment represented between 47% and 52% of our global flavor solutions sales.  Trademarks, Licenses and Patents We own a number of trademark registrations. Although in the aggregate these trademarks are material to our business, the loss of any one of those trademarks, with the exception of our \u201cMcCormick,\u201d \u201cFrench\u2019s ,\u201d \u201cFrank\u2019s RedHot,\u201d \u201cLawry\u2019s,\u201d \u201cZatarain\u2019s,\u201d \u201cCholula,\u201d \u201cStubb's,\u201d \u201cClub House,\u201d \u201cDucros,\u201d \u201cSchwartz,\u201d \u201cVahin\u00e9,\u201d \"OLD BAY,\" \"Simply Asia,\" \"Thai Kitchen,\" \u201cKamis,\u201d \u201cLa Drogheria,\u201d \"DaQiao,\" and \"Gourmet Garden\" trademarks, would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The \u201cMc \u2013 McCormick\u201d trademark is extensively used by us in connection with the sale of our food products in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. markets. The terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law, and the registrations will be renewed for as long as we deem them to be useful. We have entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of our trademarks by affiliated and non-affiliated entities. The loss of these license agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The term of the license agreements is generally two to three years or until such time as either party terminates the agreement. Those agreements with specific terms may be renewable upon agreement of the parties. We also own various patents, none of which are individually material to our business. Seasonality Due to seasonal factors inherent in our business, our sales, income and cash from operations generally are higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. This seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the consumer segment. Working Capital In order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter, we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year. We generally finance working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of our liquidity and capital resources, see note 6 of notes to our consolidated financial statements and the \u201cLiquidity and Financial Condition\u201d section of \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis.\u201d Competition Each segment operates in markets around the world that are highly competitive. In this competitive environment, our growth strategies include customer engagement and product innovation based on consumer insights. In the consumer segment, we are building brand recognition and loyalty through advertising and promotions. In our flavor solutions segment, we are differentiated by our culinary and consumer inspired flavor development as well as the breadth of our product offering and customer engagement.  Governmental Regulation We are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world that apply to our global businesses. In the United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and sale of many of our products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws, anti-corruption laws, customs and trade laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; privacy laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes, laws and regulatory requirements. Human Capital We believe in the Power of People \u2013 our employees and customers across the world.  Our high-performance culture is rooted in our shared values and respect for all contributions of every employee. Our key human capital objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. We employ various human resource programs in support of these objectives. We believe diversity, equity and inclusion are at the core of our values and strategic business priorities.  Throughout our business, we champion equality, supporting parity for women and under-represented groups as we work to create ethical, safe and supportive workplaces where our employees thrive.  We believe a diverse and inclusive workplace results in business growth and encourages increased innovation, retention of talent and a more engaged workforce.  We have various employee ambassador groups that provide a supportive, collaborative space for employees to come together to promote inclusion. We prioritize the mental health and  4 4 4   wellness of our employees by offering and encouraging participation in various programs and initiatives. Respect for human rights is fundamental to our business and its commitment to ethical business conduct. We had approximately 14,200 full-time employees worldwide as of November 30, 2022. Our operations have not been affected significantly by work stoppages, other than those associated with temporary closures of plants related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and, in the opinion of management, employee relations are good. We have approximately 400 employees in the United States who are covered by a collective bargaining contract. At our subsidiaries outside the U.S., approximately 2,600 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements.  Through our continuous listening strategy, we measure employee engagement on an ongoing basis to solicit feedback and understand views of our employees, work environment and culture. The results from these surveys are used to implement programs and processes designed to enhance employee engagement and improve the employee experience. We are committed to the safety, health, and security of our employees.  We believe a hazard-free environment is a critical enabler for the success of our business.  Throughout our operations, we strive to ensure that all of our employees have access to safe workplaces that allow them to succeed in their jobs.
