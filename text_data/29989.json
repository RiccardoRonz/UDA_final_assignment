{"cik": 29989, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business Our Business Omnicom is a strategic holding company providing advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to many of the largest global companies. Our portfolio of companies includes our global networks, BBDO, DDB, TBWA, Omnicom Media Group, the DAS Group of Companies, and the Communications Consultancy Network. All of our global networks integrate their service offerings with the Omnicom branded practice areas, including the Omnicom Health Group, the Omnicom Precision Marketing Group, the Omnicom Commerce Group, the Omnicom Advertising Collective, the Omnicom Public Relations Group, and the Omnicom Brand Consulting Group, as well as our Experiential businesses and Execution & Support businesses, which includes the Omnicom Specialty Marketing Group. We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against other global, national and regional advertising and marketing services companies, as well as technology, social media and professional services companies. The proliferation of media channels, including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and media, has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients. These developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a cost-effective way, causing them to turn to global service providers such as Omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing services designed to optimize their total marketing expenditure. On a global, pan-regional and local basis, our networks, practice areas and agencies provide a comprehensive range of services in the following fundamental disciplines: Advertising & Media, Precision Marketing, Commerce & Brand Consulting, Experiential, Execution & Support, Public Relations and Healthcare. Advertising & Media includes creative services across digital and traditional media, strategic media planning and buying, performance media and data analytics services. Precision Marketing includes digital and direct marketing, digital transformation consulting and data and analytics. Commerce & Brand Consulting services include brand and product consulting, strategy and research, retail marketing and ecommerce marketing. Experiential marketing services include live and digital events and experience design and execution. Execution & Support includes field marketing, digital and physical merchandising, point-of-sale and product placement, as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications services. Public Relations services include corporate communications, crisis management, public affairs and media and media relations services. Healthcare includes corporate communications and advertising and media services to global healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. As a leading global advertising, marketing and corporate communications company, we operate in all major markets. Our geographic markets include: the Americas, which includes North America and Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia Pacific. Our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients. While our networks, practice areas and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. Our fundamental business principle is that our clients\u2019 specific marketing requirements are the central focus of how we structure our service offerings and allocate our resources. This client-centric business model requires that multiple agencies within Omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure. This collaboration allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients\u2019 marketing requirements in a consistent and comprehensive manner. We use our client-centric approach to grow our business by expanding our service offerings to existing clients, moving into new markets and obtaining new clients. In addition, we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that currently serve or could serve our existing clients. In addition to collaborating through our client service models, our agencies and networks collaborate across internally developed technology platforms. Annalect and Omni, our proprietary data and analytics platforms, serve as the strategic resource for all of our agencies and networks to share when developing client service strategies across our virtual networks. These platforms provide precision marketing and insights at scale across creative, media and other disciplines. Driven by our clients\u2019 continuous demand for more effective and efficient marketing activities, we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services through various client-centric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives.  1 1  1   Our service offerings include:advertisingmarketing researchbrandingmedia planning and buyingcontent marketingretail media planning and buyingcorporate social responsibility consultingmerchandising and point of salecrisis communicationsmobile marketingcustom publishingmulti-cultural marketingdata analyticsnon-profit marketingdatabase managementorganizational communicationsdigital/direct marketing and post-production servicespackage designdigital transformation consultingproduct placemententertainment marketingpromotional marketingexperiential marketingpublic affairsfield marketingpublic relationsfinancial/corporate business-to-business advertisingretail marketinggraphic arts/digital imagingretail media and ecommercehealthcare marketing and communicationssearch engine marketinginstore designshopper marketinginteractive marketingsocial media marketinginvestor relationssports and event marketing Certain business trends have impacted our business and industry. These trends include clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan-regional and global markets and integrating traditional and non-traditional marketing channels, as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms. As clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency, they tend to continue to consolidate their business within one or a small number of service providers in the pursuit of a single engagement covering all consumer touch points. We have structured our business around these trends. We believe that our key client matrix organization structure approach to collaboration and integration of our services and solutions have provided a competitive advantage to our business in the past and we expect this to continue over the medium and long term. Our key client matrix organization structure facilitates superior client management and allows for greater integration across our service platforms. Our overarching strategy is to continue to use our virtual client networks to grow our business relationships with our largest clients by serving them across our networks, disciplines and geographies. We continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities, as well as to identify non-strategic or underperforming businesses for disposition. For information about our acquisitions and dispositions, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, - Acquisitions and Goodwill and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. In each of the three years ended December\u00a031, 2022, none of our acquisitions or dispositions, individually or in the aggregate, was material to our results of operations or financial position. The various components of our business, including revenue by discipline and geographic area, and material factors that affected us in the three years ended December\u00a031, 2022, are discussed in the MD&A. Our Clients Our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy. In many cases, multiple agencies or networks serve different brands, product groups or both within the same client. For example, in 2022, our largest client represented 2.7% of revenue and was served by approximately 90 of our agencies. Our 100 largest clients, many of which represent the largest global companies, represented approximately 53% of revenue and were each served, on average, by approximately 54 of our agencies. Although we have a large and diverse client base, we are not immune to general economic downturns. Government Regulations We are subject to various local, state and federal laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct business. Compliance with these laws and regulations in the normal course of business did not have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial position. Additional information regarding the impact of government regulations on our business is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulatory Risks.   2 2  2   Human Capital Resources and Environmental Sustainability Initiatives Our employees are our most important assets. We believe a critical component of our success depends on the ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar. Common to all is the ability to understand a client\u2019s brand or product and its selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client\u2019s target audience, whether through traditional channels or emerging digital platforms. Recognizing the importance of this core competency, we support and develop our employees through training and development programs that build and strengthen employees\u2019 leadership and professional skills. Human capital management strategies are developed collectively by senior management, including the management teams of our networks, practice areas, and agencies, and are overseen by our Board of Directors. We are committed to efforts that ensure that the workplace is equitable, ethical, fosters an inclusive work environment across our global workforce and respects human rights. Our social and human capital management priorities include, among other things, adopting codes of conduct and business ethics, providing competitive wages and benefits, comprehensive training programs, succession planning, promoting diversity and inclusion and implementing programs that prioritize the achievement of systemic equity throughout our organization. At December\u00a031, 2022, we employed approximately 74,200 people worldwide, including 31,500 people in the Americas, 27,500 people in EMEA, and 15,200 people in Asia Pacific. Our largest employee base is the United States, where we employed approximately 25,600 people. None of our regular employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. In certain countries outside the United States, primarily in Europe, some employees are represented by work councils. See the MD&A for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations. Our environmental sustainability initiatives focus on efficiency of office space, energy usage and travel. In connection with our environmental sustainability efforts, we are a signatory to the UN Global Compact, a principle-based framework to encourage businesses and firms worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies. We support the UN Sustainable Development Goals, a collection of global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better, more inclusive and sustainable future. Also, we are committed to joining the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi), which publicly audits companies on their emissions reduction efforts.
