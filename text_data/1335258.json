We serve artists, venues and sports teams and leagues to secure content and tickets; we invest in technology to build innovative products which advance our ticketing, digital presence, including mobile platforms, and advertising; and we are paid by advertisers that want to connect their brands with our passionate fan base.  Our core businesses surrounding the promotion of live events include ticketing and sponsorship and advertising. We believe our focus on growing these businesses will increase shareholder value as we continue to enhance our revenue streams and achieve economies of scale with our global platforms. We also continue to strengthen our core operations, further expanding into global markets and optimizing our cost structure. Our strategy is to grow and innovate through the initiatives listed below.  \u2022Invest in Product Improvements. We will continue to invest in our ticketing platforms and develop innovative products to grow our sales channels, drive increased ticket sales, grow non-service fee revenue streams, and continue to build our client base. These include technological and digital transformations to improve the experience and transparency for fans, venues, and event organizers as well as the overall quality of service. In addition, we will continue to invest to eliminate fraud such as our focus on anti-BOT technology and the creation of our Verified Fan service. \u2022Expand our Concert Platform. We will deliver more shows, grow our fan base and increase our ticket sales by continuing to build our portfolio of concerts globally, expanding our business into additional top global music markets, and further building our presence in existing markets. Through our strong partnership with artists, agents and managers, we believe we can continue to expand our concert base by delivering strong and consistent services. In December 2021 we acquired OCESA, one of the most prominent live event businesses globally with a robust business portfolio in ticketing, sponsorship, food and beverage, merchandise, and venue operations across Mexico and Latin America. \u2022Grow our Revenue per Show. We will grow our revenue per show across our venues through more effective ticket pricing, broader ticketing distribution and more targeted promotional marketing. We will also grow our onsite fan monetization by improving ease of purchase including contactless payment and rollout of digital technology, through improved onsite products, merchandising, and enhanced experiences for our fans. \u2022Sell More Tickets. We are focused on selling tickets through a wide set of sales channels, including mobile and online, and leveraging our fan database. We will continue to enhance our application programming interface features to reach a broader audience and expand our digital ticketing rollout, strengthening control over distribution for our clients and creating new and unique marketing opportunities. We will grow the volume of secondary tickets sold through a trusted environment for fan ticket exchanges, allowing our fans to have a dependable, secure destination for secondary ticket acquisition for all events. \u2022Grow Sponsorship and Advertising Partnerships. We will continue to drive growth in our sponsorship relationships and capture a larger share of the global music sponsorship market by further monetizing our fan base and portfolio of brands. We will focus on expanding existing partnerships and developing new corporate sponsor partners to provide them with targeted strategic programs, accessing the fans attending our shows each year. We will continue to develop and to scale new products in order to drive onsite and digital revenue.   Our Strengths  We believe we have unique resources that are unmatched in the live entertainment industry.  \u2022Fans. During 2022, we connected over 670 million\u00a0fans to their favorite live event. Our database of fans and their interests provides us with the means to efficiently communicate to them on shows they are likely to be interested in.  \u2022Artists. We have extensive relationships with artists ranging from those just beginning their careers to established superstars. In 2022, we promoted shows or tours for over 7,800 artists globally. In addition, through our artist management companies, we managed more than 410 artists in 2022. \u2022Digital Platforms and Ticketing. We own and operate various branded websites, both in the United States and abroad, which are customized to reflect services offered in each jurisdiction. Our primary commercial websites, www.livenation.com and www.ticketmaster.com, together with our other branded ticketing websites, are designed to promote ticket sales for live events. We also have both Live Nation and Ticketmaster mobile apps that our fans can use to access event information and buy tickets. 3 3  3   \u2022Distribution Network. We believe that our global distribution network of promoters, venues and festivals provides us with a strong position in the live concert industry. We believe we have one of the largest global networks of live entertainment businesses in the world, with offices in 44 countries worldwide. In addition, we own, lease, operate, have exclusive booking rights for, or have an equity interest in 338 venues and have operations located across 48 countries as of the end of 2022, making us, we believe, the second largest operator of music venues in the world. We also believe that we are one of the largest music festival producers in the world with 147 festivals globally in 2022. In addition, we believe that our global ticketing distribution network\u2014which includes one of the largest ecommerce sites and related apps along with approximately 9,300 clients worldwide in 2022 \u2014 makes us the largest ticketing network in the world.  \u2022Sponsors. We monetize our physical and digital assets through long-term sponsorship agreements and advertising. We employ a sales force of approximately 600 people that worked with approximately 1,200 sponsors during 2022, through a combination of strategic partnerships, local venue-related deals, national agreements and digital campaigns, both in North America and internationally. Our sponsors include some of the most well-recognized national and global brands across diverse sectors including consumer, financials and leisure including Citibank, O2, American Express, Cisco, Hilton, Red Bull and Anheuser Busch (each of these brands is a registered trademark of the sponsor).   Our Industry  We operate in the following main industries within the live entertainment business: live music events, music venue operations, the provision of management and other services to artists and athletes, ticketing services and sponsorship and advertising sales.  The live music industry includes concert promotion and/or production of music events or tours. Typically, to initiate live music events or tours, booking agents contract with artists to represent them for defined periods. Booking agents then work with promoters, who will contract with them or with artists directly, to arrange events. Promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets. Artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas, which may include fixed guarantees and/or a percentage of ticket sales or event profits. In addition, promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production, such as sound and lights. Under guaranteed payment formulas, promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events. Promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses. Promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees. Artist managers primarily provide services to music artists to manage their careers. The artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee, generally as a percentage of the artist\u2019s earnings. Our strategy is to provide minimum revenue guarantees to artists, which generates the vast majority of their total income. We believe the artist-fan connection is the source of nearly all commercial value and as a result, our artists receive the majority of all ticketing revenue. For music tours, four to eight months typically elapse between initially booking artists and the first performances. Artists, in conjunction with promoters, managers and booking agents, set ticket prices and advertising plans. Promoters market events, sell tickets, rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services, such as stages and equipment. Venue operators typically contract with promoters to have their venues rented for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income. In addition, venue operators provide services such as concessions, parking, security, ushering and ticket scanning at the gate, and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions, merchandise, parking and premium seating.   Ticketing services generally refers to the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels, but also include sales through phone, outlet and box office channels. Ticketing companies will contract with venues and/or promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time, generally three to five years. The ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges. The ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue and/or promoter after deducting its fee. Venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company\u2019s technology. The ticketing company will generally not earn a fee on these box office tickets. Ticketing resale services generally refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally obtained the tickets from a venue or other entity, or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue or other entity. Resale tickets are also referred to as secondary tickets. Generally, the ticket resale company is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the ticket value is paid to the holder. 4 4  4   The sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of\u00a0international, national, regional and local advertising and promotional programs to a variety of companies to advertise or promote their brand, product or service.\u00a0These sponsorships typically include venue naming rights, onsite venue signage, online advertisements\u00a0and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as credit card, beverage, travel and telecommunications, and may include event pre-sales and onsite product activation.   Our Business  Our reportable segments are Concerts, Ticketing and Sponsorship & Advertising.  Concerts. Our Concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented third-party venues, the operation and management of music venues, the production of music festivals across the world, the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists. Including intersegment revenue, our Concerts business generated $13.5 billion, or 80.9%, of our total revenue during 2022. We promoted more than 43,600 live music and other events in 2022. While our Concerts segment traditionally operates year-round, we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals, which primarily occur from May through October. As a promoter, we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas, including a fixed guaranteed amount and/or a percentage of ticket sales or event profits. For each event we promote, we either use a venue we own or operate, or rent a third-party venue. Revenue is generally impacted by the number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue. As a result, significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income. As a venue operator, we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions, parking, premium seating, rental income and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements. In our amphitheaters, the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire, which is recorded in revenue with limited associated direct operating expenses. Revenue generated from venue operations typically has a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically has a more direct relationship to changes in operating income.  As a festival promoter, we typically book artists, secure festival sites, provide for third-party production services, sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans.\u00a0We also provide or arrange for third parties to provide operational services\u00a0as needed such as concessions, merchandising and\u00a0security. We earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount.\u00a0We also earn revenue from the sale of concessions, camping fees and service charges earned on tickets sold. For each event, we either use a festival site we own or rent a third-party festival site. Revenue is generally impacted by the number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue. Since the artist fees are typically fixed guarantees for these events, significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income. Ticketing. Our Ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a portion of the service charge as its fee. We sell tickets for our events and also for third-party clients across multiple live event categories, providing ticketing services for leading arenas, stadiums, amphitheaters, music clubs, concert promoters, professional sports franchises and leagues, college sports teams, performing arts venues, museums and theaters. We sell tickets through mobile apps, websites and ticket outlets. During 2022, we sold 56%, 42% and 2% of primary tickets through these channels, respectively. Our Ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and product offerings. Including intersegment revenue, our Ticketing business generated $2.2 billion, or 13.4%, of our total revenue during 2022, which excludes the face value of tickets sold and is net of the fees paid to our ticketing clients. Through all of our ticketing services, we sold approximately 281 million tickets in 2022 on which we were paid fees for our services. In addition, approximately 270 million tickets were sold using our Ticketmaster systems, including through season seat packages, our venue clients\u2019 box offices, and other channels through which we did not receive a fee. Our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public, which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients. As ticket sales increase, related ticketing operating income generally increases as well. 5 5  5   We sell tickets on behalf of our clients through our ticketing platforms across the world. We generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multi-year periods, typically ranging from three to five\u00a0years. Pursuant to these agreements, clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale, when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket price will be, sometimes with our guidance and recommendations. Agreements with venue clients in North America and Australia generally grant us exclusive rights to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public. Agreements with promoter clients in other international markets generally grant us the right to an allocation of tickets for events presented by a given promoter at any venue, unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider. Similarly, in such international markets we have venue agreements which provide Ticketmaster an allocation of tickets for all events at those venues. While we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients\u2019 tickets, venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute a portion of their tickets in-house through their box office and season ticket programs. In addition, under many written agreements between promoters and our clients, and generally subject to Ticketmaster approval, the client may allocate certain tickets for artist, promoter, agent and venue use and do not make those tickets available for sale by us. Due to these and other permitted third-party ticket distribution channels, we do not always sell all of our clients\u2019 tickets, even at venues where we are the exclusive primary ticketing service provider, and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event, and also varies as to any given client from year to year. We currently offer ticket resale services, sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing, principally through our integrated inventory platform, league/team platforms and other platforms internationally. We enter into arrangements with the holders of tickets previously distributed by a venue or other source to post those tickets for sale at a purchase price equal to a new sales price, determined by the ticket holder, plus a service fee to the buyer. The seller in this circumstance receives the new sales price less a seller service fee. Sponsorship\u00a0& Advertising. Our Sponsorship\u00a0& Advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic, international, national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concert, festival, venue and ticketing assets, including advertising on our websites. We work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that support their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists. We also develop, book and produce custom events or programs for our clients\u2019 specific brands, which are typically presented exclusively to the clients\u2019 consumers. These custom events can involve live music events with talent and media, using both online and traditional outlets. Including intersegment revenue, our Sponsorship\u00a0& Advertising business generated $968.1 million, or 5.8%, of our total revenue during 2022. We typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are usually associated with our outdoor venues and festivals, which are primarily used in or occur from May through October. We believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs. We continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships, both domestically and internationally, and placement of advertising, including signage, online advertising and promotional programs. Many of our venues have naming rights sponsorship programs. We believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and festivals and to arrange multi-venue or multi-festival branding opportunities for advertisers. Our local and venue-focused sponsorships include venue signage, promotional programs, onsite activation, hospitality and tickets, and are derived from a variety of client companies across various industry categories.    Live Nation Venue Details  In the live entertainment industry, venue types generally consist of:  \u2022Stadiums\u2014Stadiums are multi-purpose facilities, often housing local sports teams. Stadiums typically have 30,000 or more seats. Although they are the largest venues available for live music, they are not specifically designed for live music.  \u2022Amphitheaters\u2014Amphitheaters are generally outdoor venues with between 5,000 and 30,000 seats that are used primarily in the summer season. We believe they are popular because they are designed specifically for concert events, with premium seat packages and better lines of sight and acoustics.  \u2022Arenas\u2014Arenas are indoor venues that are used as multi-purpose facilities, often housing local sports teams. Arenas typically have between 5,000 and 20,000 seats. Because they are indoors, they are able to offer amenities that other similar-sized outdoor venues cannot, such as luxury suites and premium club memberships. As a result, we believe they are popular for higher-priced concerts aimed at audiences willing to pay for these amenities. 6 6  6   \u2022Theaters\u2014Theaters are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events, but may include theatrical performances. These venues typically have a capacity of between 1,000 and 6,500. Theaters represent less risk to concert promoters because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and may provide a more appropriately-sized venue for developing artists and more artists in general. Because these venues have a smaller capacity than an amphitheater or arena, they do not offer as much economic upside on a per show basis. Theaters can also be used year-round.  \u2022Clubs\u2014Clubs are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events, but may also include comedy clubs. These venues typically have a capacity of less than 1,000 and often without full fixed seating. Because of their small size, they do not offer as much economic upside, but they also represent less risk to a concert promoter because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and also may provide a more appropriately-sized venue for developing artists. Clubs can also be used year-round.  \u2022Restaurants & Music Halls\u2014Restaurants & Music Halls are indoor venues that offer customers an integrated live music, entertainment and dining experience.  This category includes our House of Blues\u00ae and Brooklyn Bowl\u00ae venues whose live music halls are specially designed to provide optimum acoustics and typically can accommodate between 1,000 to 2,000 guests. A full-service restaurant and bar is located adjacent to the live music hall. We believe that the strength of the brand and the quality of the food, service and unique atmosphere in our restaurants attract customers to these venues independently from a live music event and generate a significant amount of repeat business from local customers.  \u2022Festival Sites\u2014Festival sites are outdoor locations used primarily in the summer season to stage large single-day or multi-day concert events featuring several artists on multiple stages. Depending on the location, festival site capacities can range from 10,000 to over 100,000 fans per day. We believe they are popular because of the value provided to the fan by packaging several artists together for an event. While festival sites only host a few events each year, they can provide higher operating income because we are able to generate income from many different services provided at the event.  \u2022Other Venues\u2014Other venues includes restaurants, exhibition and convention halls that typically are not used for live music events. The following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned, leased, operated, had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest over which we had a significant influence as of December\u00a031, 2022:Venue Type\u00a0CapacityOwned\u00a0LeasedOperatedExclusiveBookingRightsEquityInterest\u00a0TotalStadiumMore than 30,000\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a01\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a01\u00a0Amphitheater\u00a05,000 - 30,00010\u00a039\u00a01\u00a016\u00a0\u2014\u00a066\u00a0Arena\u00a05,000 - 20,0002\u00a013\u00a02\u00a05\u00a01\u00a023\u00a0Theater\u00a01,000 - 6,5009\u00a066\u00a010\u00a024\u00a02\u00a0111\u00a0Club\u00a0Less than 1,0005\u00a043\u00a01\u00a014\u00a0\u2014\u00a063\u00a0Restaurants & Music Halls\u00a01,000 - 2,0002\u00a016\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a018\u00a0Festival Sites (1)Varies2\u00a0\u2014\u00a038\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a040\u00a0Other VenuesVaries\u2014\u00a011\u00a0\u2014\u00a02\u00a03\u00a016\u00a0Total venues in operation30\u00a0188\u00a053\u00a061\u00a06\u00a0338\u00a0Venues currently under construction\u2014\u00a04\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a02\u00a06\u00a0Venues not currently in operation3\u00a01\u00a0\u2014\u00a04\u00a02\u00a010\u00a0Total venues in operation by location:North America21\u00a0137\u00a014\u00a060\u00a06\u00a0238\u00a0International9\u00a051\u00a039\u00a01\u00a0\u2014\u00a0100\u00a0 Festival Sites (1) __________ (1)Operated festival sites includes multi-year agreements providing us the right to use public or private land for a defined period of time leading up to and continuing after the festival.\u00a0We may enter into multiple agreements for a single festival site or use the same site for multiple festivals.\u00a0We have aggregated the agreements for each festival site and reported them as one festival site. 7 7  7    Competition  Competition in the live entertainment industry is intense. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events, sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences. We believe that our primary strengths include: \u2022the quality of service delivered to our artists, fans, ticketing clients and corporate sponsors;  \u2022our track record and reputation in promoting and producing live music events and tours both domestically and internationally;  \u2022our artist relationships;  \u2022our global footprint;  \u2022the quality of our ticketing software and services;  \u2022our ecommerce site and its extensive database;  \u2022our diverse distribution platform of venues;  \u2022the scope, effectiveness and expertise of our advertising and sponsorship programs; and  \u2022our financial stability.  Although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors, we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors, especially those with significantly greater brand recognition, or greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources.  In the markets in which we promote music concerts, we face competition from other promoters and venue operators. We believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations.  Some of our competitors in the live music promotion industry are Anschutz Entertainment Group, or AEG, Another Planet Entertainment, CTS Eventim, Jam Productions, Ltd., I.M.P., Outback Presents and TEG Dainty in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos and venues in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. AEG operates under a number of different names including AEG Presents, Concerts West, Frontier Touring, Goldenvoice and Messina Touring Group. Some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets, have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets, which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us. In markets where we own or operate a venue, we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region. Consequently, touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours. Our main competitors in venue management include ASM Global, Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp., The Nederlander Organization and Bowery Presents, in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Some of our competitors in venue management may have more attractive or a greater number of venues in certain markets, and may have greater financial resources in those markets. The ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels, but also through telephone and ticket outlets. The transition to online and mobile ticket purchases has made it easier for technology-based companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone, automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize self-ticketing systems. In the online environment, we compete with other websites, online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information, sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites.  We experience competition from other national, regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events. Resale, or secondary, ticketing services have created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby certain brokers are using automated internet \u201cbot\u201d technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale, notwithstanding federal and state prohibitions. We actively develop and apply methods to mitigate the impact of these bots, however, the bot technology constantly evolves and changes. The internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on resale websites and marketplaces, and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events. 8 8  8   We also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell self-ticketing systems, as well as from venues that choose to integrate self-ticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers. Our competitors include primary ticketing companies such as Tickets.com, AXS, Paciolan, Inc., CTS Eventim AG, Eventbrite, eTix, SeatGeek, Ticketek, See Tickets and Dice; secondary ticketing companies such as StubHub, Vivid Seats, Viagogo and SeatGeek; and many others, including large technology and ecommerce companies that we understand have recently entered or could enter these markets. Our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams, which often offer state-of-the-art venues, strong brand association and attractive local media packages, as well as festivals, theme parks and other local events. On the national level, our competitors include the major sports leagues that sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages. Government Regulations  We are subject to federal, state and local laws, both domestically and internationally, governing matters such as:  \u2022privacy and the protection of personal or sensitive information;  \u2022compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries;  \u2022primary ticketing and ticket resale services; \u2022construction, renovation and operation of our venues;  \u2022licensing, permitting and zoning, including noise ordinances;  \u2022human health, safety, security and sanitation requirements;  \u2022the service of food and alcoholic beverages;  \u2022working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, citizenship and employment laws;  \u2022compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), the United Kingdom\u2019s Disability Discrimination Act of 1995 (\u201cDDA\u201d) and similar regulations in other countries;  \u2022hazardous and non-hazardous waste and other environmental protection laws;  \u2022sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes;  \u2022marketing activities via the telephone and online; and \u2022historic landmark rules. We believe that we are materially in compliance with these laws.  We are required to comply with federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data, an area that is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including the European Union\u2019s GDPR (as defined and discussed below in Item 1A.\u2014Risk Factors) and the California Consumer Protection Act. We are required to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate and also the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 regarding anti-bribery regulations. These regulations make it illegal for us to pay, promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to, or from, any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business. This ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute. From time to time, federal, state, local and international authorities and/or consumers commence investigations, inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection, advertising, unfair business practice, antitrust (and similar or related laws) and other laws, particularly as related to primary ticketing and ticket resale services. The regulations relating to our food service operations in our venues are many and complex. A variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling, preparation and serving of food, the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of food-handling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level.  9 9  9   We also must comply with applicable licensing laws, as well as state and local service laws, commonly called dram shop statutes. Dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor. If we violate dram shop laws, we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer. Although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation, we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us.  We are also required to comply with the ADA, the DDA and certain state statutes and local ordinances that, among other things, require that places of public accommodation, including our websites as well as existing and newly constructed venues, be accessible to customers with disabilities. The ADA and the DDA require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue. The ADA and the DDA may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled. In order to comply with the ADA, the DDA and other similar ordinances, we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future.  From time to time, governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could affect our business. For example, some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events, particularly relating to drugs and alcohol. Some jurisdictions have also proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods or mandate ticket inventory disclosure.  In addition, we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances, as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect, among other things, the hours of operations of and the type of events we can produce at our venues.    Our People and Culture Bringing more than 43,600 events to life and connecting over 670\u00a0million fans across all of our concerts and ticketing platforms, as we did in 2022, is a massive undertaking, made possible by our thousands of employees spread across 48 countries. Our teams come together every day to grow our business, and we recognize our people are the key to our success\u2014whether they\u2019re putting on a show at one of our venues, selling tickets, working with our brand partners or supporting our businesses in a myriad of other ways. Taking Care of Our Own Our core value with our employees is \u201ctaking care of our own,\u201d which means our top priority is making sure that every employee can rely on us to go above just providing standard compensation and benefits by offering assistance for a range of planned and unplanned situations. We also ensure that our employees have direct access to senior executives to raise concerns and share ideas. Our programs are structured under eight core pillars, designed to support key life moments: \u2022Taking Care of Yourself: To enhance overall happiness and wellness, we offer flexible vacation time, free ticket perks and in-house meditation sessions, crisis support and crowdfunding networks, and more. \u2022Taking Care of Your Health: Beyond a full suite of medical, dental and vision benefits, we provide access to virtual doctor\u2019s appointments. \u2022Taking Care of Your Mental Health: In 2022, we doubled down on our mental well-being offerings for staff \u2013 free virtual mental health coaching or therapy sessions, group support sessions, 24/7 counselor support line, and both in-person or virtual meditation and yoga sessions. \u2022Taking Care of Your Family: We provide assistance with fertility needs such as egg-freezing, egg-donation and IVF, as well as adoption or surrogacy, primary caregiver leave for new parents, sick leave to care for loved ones, and leave for bereavement or end-of-life care. \u2022Taking Care of Your Career: We offer many different career advancement opportunities including leadership workshops for mid-career employees, recognition for successful patent applications, live and on-demand training and tuition reimbursement to further an ongoing education. \u2022Taking Care of Your Wealth: To support long-term financial goals, we traditionally provide 401(k) or pension matching, a stock reimbursement program, and student loan repayment assistance. \u2022Taking Care of Our Own: During life\u2019s most difficult moments, we offer employees financial support to help them through a variety of crises, including unexpected deaths, natural disasters, and escaping domestic violence. To this end, in March 2020, in partnership with House of Blues Music Forward Foundation, we announced Crew Nation, a global relief fund offering financial support to live music crews to which we have donated over $10\u00a0million. 10 10  10   \u2022Taking Care of Others: In order to empower our employees to get involved in causes that are meaningful to them, we provide paid time off for them to volunteer in their local communities. Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging We are continually striving towards our goal of being as diverse as the fans and artists that we serve, with an aim to uplift people across race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and other underrepresented groups. Programs key to this mission include: \u2022Promotion and Pay: Ongoing reviews of positions and compensation with the goal of ensuring that all employees across Live Nation are paid appropriately and provided with promotion opportunities, regardless of individual demographics. \u2022Employee Resource Groups: Our seven employee-led groups with executive leaders as sponsors provide programs that focus on empowering underrepresented groups within our employee base through career development, networking, talent development, advocacy, non-profit support and community outreach. \u2022Diversity Goals: We remain committed to reaching the ambitious goals we set to strengthen the company\u2019s diversity from the top down. Our efforts thus far have resulted in both hiring and promoting diverse talent into a number of key leadership roles and in increasing overall representation across the business. \u2022Live Nation Women Fund: An early-stage investment fund we have created focused on female-led live music businesses. \u2022Industry Engagement: In 2022, we further demonstrated our commitment to diversity and inclusion by joining the efforts of \u201cDiversify The Stage\u201d and signing their pledge to provide greater access to equitable opportunities for underrepresented groups in live music, events, and touring industries. Our efforts around diversity, equity, and inclusion have also gained us recognition on Forbes\u2019 Best Employers for Diversity list (2019, 2021-22), Forbes\u2019 America\u2019s Best Employers for Women (2022), Forbes\u2019 Best Employers for New Grads (2022), and Newsweek\u2019s Americas Greatest Workplaces for Diversity List (2023).  We have also received a score of 100% on Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s Corporate Equality Index (2019-22), earning us a Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality designation. Human Capital Our compensation philosophy is focused on attracting and retaining talented individuals who contribute to our values and help lead our dynamic and innovative environment. To determine market-competitive pay for our employees, we use a combination of entertainment and technology industry benchmarks. We are committed to encouraging and rewarding pay-for-performance that is aligned with business objectives in the best interest of our shareholders for long-term growth and profitability. We further strive to reward individual achievements and contributions that are both aligned with and supportive of our short- and long-term goals and core business values. We believe that our efforts in these areas are working and contributing to the overall success of the Company, as evidenced by accolades such as obtaining a Great Place to Work\u00ae\u202fcertification (2017-19, 2022), placing fourth\u202fon\u202fIndeed's\u202flist of the World's 50 Best Workplaces\u202f(2019), placing on Forbes\u2019 America\u2019s Best Large Employers List (2022), placing third on Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies list for the music sector (2019), and placing on Fortune\u2019s World\u2019s Most Admired Companies List (2021). As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 12,800 full-time employees. During regular operational times, our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year. Therefore, we also employ seasonal and part-time employees, primarily for our live music venues and festivals. At the end of 2022, we employed approximately 15,500 seasonal and part-time employees and during peak seasonal periods, particularly in the summer months, we employed as many as 29,000 seasonal and part-time employees in 2022.        11 11  11   Labor Relations The stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events, and there have been no related significant work stoppages in the past three years. Upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements, however, we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us, and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements. In addition, our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently. A work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations.
