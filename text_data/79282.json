{"cik": 79282, "item_1A": "ITEM 1. Business. General Brown & Brown is a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and service organization with origins dating from 1939 and is headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Company markets and sells insurance products and services, primarily in the property, casualty and employee benefits areas. We provide our customers with quality, non-investment insurance contracts, as well as other targeted, customized risk management products and services. We primarily operate as an agent or broker and therefore, with limited exceptions, do not assume underwriting risks. Within The Wright Insurance Group, LLC (\u201cWright\u201d), we operate a write-your-own flood insurance carrier, Wright National Flood Insurance Company (\u201cWNFIC\u201d). WNFIC\u2019s underwriting business consists of policies written pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Program (\u201cNFIP\u201d), the program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d), excess flood and private flood policies which are fully reinsured, thereby substantially eliminating WNFIC\u2019s exposure to underwriting risk, as these policies are backed by either FEMA or a reinsurance carrier with an AM Best Company rating of \u201cA\u201d or better. We also participate in capitalized captive insurance facilities (the \"Captives\") for the purpose of providing additional capacity to place coverage, deliver revenues, and participate in underwriting results. The Company has traditionally participated in underwriting profits through profit-sharing contingent commissions. The Captives give us another way to continue to participate in underwriting results while limiting exposure to underwriting claim costs. The Captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain managing general agents. The Captives limit, but do not fully eliminate the Company's exposure to claims expenses either through reinsurance or by only participating in limited tranches of the underwriting results. The Company is compensated for its services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies, and to a lesser extent, by fees paid directly by customers for certain services. Commission revenues are generally a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and typically depend upon the type of insurance, the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us. In some limited cases, we share commissions with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction and we recognize commissions net of any commissions paid to other intermediaries. We may also receive from an insurance company a profit-sharing contingent commission, which is a supplemental commission based primarily on underwriting results. Fee revenues are generated by: (i) our Services segment, which provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers\u2019 compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as Medicare Set-aside services, Social Security disability and Medicare benefits advocacy services, and other claims adjusting services, (ii) our National Programs and Wholesale Brokerage segments, which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers, and (iii) our Retail segment for fees received in lieu of commissions or for other services provided. The amount of our revenues from commissions and fees is a function of several factors, including continued new business production, retention of existing customers, acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units, which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, sales and payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. Insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control. As of December 31, 2022, our activities were conducted in 345 domestic locations in 46 states, and 150 international locations in Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Cayman Islands, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom. Segment Information Our business is divided into four reportable segments: (i) the Retail segment, (ii) the National Programs segment, (iii) the Wholesale Brokerage segment and (iv) the Services segment. The Retail segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public and quasi-public entities, and to professional and individual customers, as well as non-insurance warranty services and products through our F&I businesses. The National Programs segment, which acts as a managing general agent (\u201cMGA\u201d), provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals, a range of insurance products for individuals, flood coverage, and targeted products and services designated for specific industries, trade groups, governmental entities and market niches, all of which are delivered through a nationwide network of independent agents, including Brown & Brown retail agents, as well as affinity groups, wholesale entities and sold direct to consumers. The Wholesale Brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through a nationwide network of independent agents and brokers, including Brown & Brown retail agents. The Services segment provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and adjusting services, comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers\u2019 compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as Medicare Set-aside services and Social Security disability benefits advocacy services. 5 \u00a0 The following table summarizes (i) the commissions and fees generated by each of our reportable operating segments for 2022, 2021, and 2020 and (ii) the percentage of our total commissions and fees represented by each segment for each such period: \u00a0 (in millions, except percentages) \u00a0 2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 % \u00a0 \u00a0 2021 \u00a0 \u00a0 % \u00a0 \u00a0 2020 \u00a0 \u00a0 % \u00a0 Retail segment \u00a0 $ 2,081.6 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 58.4 % \u00a0 $ 1,766.6 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 58.0 % \u00a0 $ 1,471.4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 56.5 % National Programs segment \u00a0 \u00a0 858.1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 24.1 % \u00a0 \u00a0 701.1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 23.0 % \u00a0 \u00a0 609.8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 23.4 % Wholesale Brokerage segment \u00a0 \u00a0 452.8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 12.7 % \u00a0 \u00a0 402.6 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 13.2 % \u00a0 \u00a0 352.2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 13.5 % Services segment \u00a0 \u00a0 171.9 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4.8 % \u00a0 \u00a0 178.9 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5.9 % \u00a0 \u00a0 174.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6.7 % Other \u00a0 \u00a0 (1.2 ) \u00a0 \u00a0 (\u2014 )% \u00a0 \u00a0 (1.7 ) \u00a0 \u00a0 (0.1 )% \u00a0 \u00a0 (1.3 ) \u00a0 \u00a0 (0.1 )% Total \u00a0 $ 3,563.2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 100.0 % \u00a0 $ 3,047.5 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 100.0 % \u00a0 $ 2,606.1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 100.0 % \u00a0 The majority of our operations are in the United States. Outside of the United States we have retail operations based in Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, wholesale brokerage operations based in the Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom and a managing general agent operation in Canada and the United Kingdom. These operations generated $240.6 million, $78.0 million and $35.1 million of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not have any material foreign long-lived assets.

In connection with selling and marketing of insurance coverages, we provide a broad range of related services to our customers, such as risk management strategies, loss control surveys and analysis, consultation in connection with placing insurance coverages and claims processing. 6 \u00a0 National Programs segment As of December 31, 2022, our National Programs segment employed 3,008 employees. The National Programs segment specializes in the development and management of insurance program business, often designed for niche, underserved markets and distributes these coverages to retail insurance agencies (including Brown & Brown retail offices), as well as affinity groups, wholesale entities and sold direct to consumers. Our largest National Programs segment customer represented approximately 7.6% of the segment's total commissions and fees. We offer program management expertise for insurance carrier partners across numerous lines of business, which can be grouped into five broad categories as detailed below: \u00a0 Professional programs. Professional liability and related package insurance products are tailored to the needs of professionals in the following areas: dentistry, legal, eyecare, insurance, financial, physicians and real estate title professionals.

The Arrowhead Core Commercial program which covered a broad segment of industries is currently in run-off.  \u00a0 Public Entity programs. Public entity programs range from providing fully insured programs to establishing risk retention insurance pools, and excess and facultative specific coverages, including administration of various insurance trusts for cities, counties, municipalities, school boards, special taxing districts and quasi-governmental agencies. \u00a0 Specialty programs. Specialty programs include flood insurance, commercial difference-in-conditions (earthquake), all-risk commercial property, limited exposure captives, coastal property programs including wind, lender-placed solutions, sovereign native-American nations and parcel insurance. Wholesale Brokerage segment As of December 31, 2022, our Wholesale Brokerage segment employed 1,687 employees. Our Wholesale Brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial insurance products and services to retail insurance agencies (including Brown & Brown retail offices). The Wholesale Brokerage segment represent various U.S., U.K., and European surplus lines insurance companies. Additionally, certain offices are also Lloyd\u2019s of London correspondents. The Wholesale Brokerage segment also represents admitted insurance companies for purposes of affording access to such companies for smaller agencies that otherwise do not have access to large insurance company representation. Excess and surplus insurance products encompass many insurance coverages, including personal lines, homeowners, yachts, jewelry, commercial property and casualty, commercial automobile, garage, restaurant, builder\u2019s risk and inland marine lines. Difficult-to-insure general liability and products liability coverages are a specialty, as is excess workers\u2019 compensation coverage. During 2022, commissions and fees from our largest Wholesale Brokerage segment customer represented approximately 1.4% of the Wholesale Brokerage segment\u2019s total commissions and fees. Services segment As of December 31, 2022, our Services segment employed 991 employees and provided a wide range of insurance-related services. Below are brief descriptions of the capabilities within the Services segment. \u00a0 Social Security Advocacy and Advisory. Social Security advocacy assists individuals throughout the United States who are seeking to establish eligibility for coverage under the federal Social Security Disability program and provides health plan selection and enrollment assistance for Medicare beneficiaries. We work closely with employer sponsored group life, disability and health plan participants to assist disabled individuals in receiving the education, advocacy and benefit coordination assistance necessary to achieve the fastest possible benefit approvals. In addition, we provide second injury fund recovery services to the workers\u2019 compensation insurance market. \u00a0 Claims Administration. Claims administration provides third-party administration (\u201cTPA\u201d) services for commercial and personal property and casualty, medical, vocational, and professional liability insurance markets on a nationwide basis, providing claims adjusting, administration, subrogation, litigation and data management, claims investigations services, claim investigations, and audit services to insurance companies, self-insureds, public municipalities, insurance brokers and corporate entities. We source claims activity from various Arrowhead programs in our National Programs segment, as well as from third parties. \u00a0 Medicare Secondary Payer compliance and Medicare Set-Aside.

In 2022, our five largest contracts represented approximately 22.4% of fees revenues in our Services segment. Competition The insurance intermediary business is highly competitive, and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets. Competition in the insurance business is largely based upon innovation, knowledge, understanding of terms and conditions of coverage, quality of service and price. A number of firms with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us. A number of insurance companies directly sell insurance, primarily to individuals or small enterprises, and as a result do not pay commissions to third-party agents and brokers. In addition, internet and startup technology companies continue to be a source for direct placement of personal lines or small business insurance. We have our own technology capabilities to also serve personal lines and small businesses. While it is difficult to quantify the impact on our business from individuals or small businesses purchasing insurance over the internet, we believe this risk would generally be isolated to personal lines customers with single-line coverage, or small businesses that do not have a complex insurance program, which represent a small portion of our overall Retail or National Programs segments. Regulation, Licensing and Agency Contracts We and/or our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents, brokers, intermediaries or third-party administrators by regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct business. Regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and international location and are often complex. The applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states and international jurisdictions are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by regulatory authorities, which in most cases have broad discretion as to the granting, revocation, suspension and renewal of licenses. We endeavor to monitor the licensing status of our employees, but the possibility exists that we and/or our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in a particular jurisdiction in addition to being subjected to fines. Human Capital  At December 31, 2022, the Company had 15,201 employees globally. We have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions that (i) protect our confidential information and trade secrets, (ii) restrict their ability post-employment to solicit the business of our customers, and (iii) prevent them from hiring of our employees for a period of time after separation from employment with us. The enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon applicable law and factual circumstances. The majority of our employment relationships are at-will and terminable by either party at any time; however, the covenants regarding confidential information and non-solicitation of our customers and employees generally extend for a period of at least two years after cessation of employment. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.  Our Guiding Principles The cornerstones of our organization's guiding principles are people, performance, service and innovation. We view ourselves as a team and refer to our employees as \u201cteammates.\u201d We believe in always doing what is best for our customers, communities, teammates, carrier partners and shareholders. We understand that every successful team thrives on the diversity of talent, thought, experience, character and work ethic. Our ability to continue to serve our customers and communities is dependent on the effective recruitment and enhancement of the most qualified teammates. We are an equal opportunity employer built on meritocracy, meaning our teammates have the opportunity to rise according to their merits and individual initiative.  Culture At Brown & Brown, we have a culture built on integrity, innovation, superior capabilities, discipline and meritocracy. Our commitment to doing what is best for our customers drives our sales culture and is a crucial component in our Company's strategy. We operate as a lean, highly competitive, decentralized growth and profit-oriented sales and service organization. Our teammates are our greatest resource, and by challenging, empowering and rewarding them, our teams are driven to achieve extraordinary results. 8 \u00a0 Over 20% of our Company is owned by teammates, which we believe cultivates a unique ownership culture. We strive to provide multiple opportunities for teammates to share in the ownership of Brown & Brown and to help create personal wealth, including through our employee stock purchase program, our 401(k) plan, and long-term equity grants. With more than 60% of our teammates owning stock in our Company, we operate with an ownership mindset that influences how we invest in our business and the work we do for our customers.  Our Team Our goal is to provide our teammates with long-term careers, which is why a vast majority of our teammates are full-time teammates. In addition, we also employ regular part-time teammates and seasonal/temporary teammates.  Full-time teammates work at least a 30-hours per week for an indefinite period of time and are generally eligible for all employment benefits provided by the Company. Part-time teammates work less than 30 hours per week for an indefinite period of time, and depending on the average hours worked per week, they may be eligible for limited employment benefits as specified in terms of the particular benefit plan or policy. Seasonal/temporary teammates are hired as an interim replacement to temporarily supplement our workforce or assist in completing a specific project, other than those supplied under contract by an outside agency; employment assignments in this category are typically of limited duration. Teammate Recruitment, Education and Development  Our Company focuses on recruiting and developing the most capable teammates with diverse backgrounds and experiences. We actively recruit at all offices and levels of our organization. We have seen good success over time by building our diverse team with recent college graduates, mid-level professionals with experience outside the insurance industry and seasoned insurance professionals who desire to elevate their careers. Leveraging our strong relationships with several key colleges and universities, we are also committed to recruiting and developing talent through our college intern program. In addition to individual recruitment, we focus on building our team by completing high-quality acquisitions. In 2022, we grew our team by almost 2,800 new teammates through the acquisition of 30 companies.  We believe that supporting and encouraging continued education will help to ensure we remain at the forefront of developing trends in an ever-changing industry. We are committed to investing heavily in our teammate education and development through Brown & Brown University (\"BBU\"), the Brown & Brown Education Assistance Program and our Peer Partnership Program. Teammate Benefits Brown & Brown offers a wide variety of benefits, including medical and dental coverage, short-term and long-term disability, life insurance and a 401(k) plan. We strive to have comprehensive benefit offerings, as we believe the overall well-being of our teammates and their families comes first, and having competitive benefits helps set us apart in recruiting and retaining high-quality talent. In 2022, there were no widespread layoffs or pay reductions as a result of external factors, such as the economy, the COVID-19 pandemic or natural disasters. Instead, our Company's leadership remains committed to developing our talented teammates and focusing on engagement, which we believe over time supports strong financial results. Our Company has encouraged flexible work arrangements to accommodate the evolving future of the work landscape and the needs of our teammates. Additionally, teammates affected in 2022 by the COVID-19 pandemic or natural disasters, including Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Nicole, had the opportunity to apply for financial assistance through our Brown & Brown Disaster Relief Foundation. Teammate Engagement  To better understand our Company's strengths and growth opportunities, we gather anonymous feedback from our entire team on at least an annual basis. We are committed to actively listening and amplifying our teammates' well-being, satisfaction and engagement at work, and are proud that in 2022, 93% of our teammates say Brown & Brown is a Great Place to Work\u00ae. By instilling A Meritocracy culture, we want teammates to have the opportunity to rise according to their merits. We believe a driver of our Company\u2019s results stem from our commitment to putting the health and well-being of our teammates and their families first. By valuing and supporting these priorities as an organization, we believe our Company will continue to be driven by positive, engaged and productive teams, and will retain the most talented teammates. Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging We believe having a team that is diverse in thought, experience, skills and work ethic, results in teammate empowerment and high performance. An empowered team helps to positively impact our customer service and community involvement. As part of our strategy, we continue to evolve and augment our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (\"DIB\") task force, which was established in 2020. The DIB team is composed of numerous teammates and leaders with different backgrounds, work experiences and skill sets. The mission of the task force is to provide an environment to foster the collection of ideas, thoughts and stories that help further develop a strategic framework of promoting diversity, inclusion and belonging. The task force is overseen and guided by our chief people officer. 9 \u00a0 Our DIB task force spent the past several years evaluating our Company's current strengths and opportunities for development by initiating teammate surveys, listening sessions, group focus sessions and training modalities, including a course for all teammates focused on understanding and managing unconscious bias. In 2022, the task force established four Teammate Resource Groups (\"TRG\"s) that are each founded around one identity. Each TRG meets internally, empowers one another, host events, and is expected to make recommendations on how our Company can improve policies, impact recruitment and continue to be a strong part of the community. As a way to offer teammates flexibility to observe any day during the year to recognize their culture or heritage, in 2021, our task force introduced an additional floating holiday known as Culture Day.  Brown & Brown does not tolerate discrimination in any form concerning any aspect of employment. The Company has an established a policy that recruitment, hiring, transfers, promotions, terminations, compensation and benefits practices be without regard to race, color, religion, absence of religious affiliation, national origin, ethnicity, age, disability, perception of disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, gender orientation, marital status, service in our armed forces, veteran status in our armed forces, political activity or political party affiliation. In addition, the Company monitors the representation of women and underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities, because we believe diversity helps us build better teams, facilitate innovation and improve our customer experience. We discuss our gender and minority profile periodically with our board of directors. We are proud of our efforts in this area and continue to strive to further diversify our workforce and strengthen our culture. Teammate Health and Well-being The safety and well-being of all Brown & Brown teammates and customers are of utmost importance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we navigated the pandemic by carefully executing our business continuity plan. We prioritized the health and well-being of our teammates to support the welfare of our customers, carrier partners and shareholders. The Brown & Brown team demonstrated resiliency in a time of uncertainty, and through \u201cThe Power of WE,\u201d navigated this uncharted territory with minimal interruption to our business. We know we must remain prepared to deal with future pandemics. Our response has formed the basis for preparedness if another dangerous and contagious disease should arise. Beginning in March 2020, the Company implemented a telecommuting protocol in response to COVID-19. Since then, remote work has provided an important layer of safety and flexibility. Hybrid workforce models have now been embraced by most of our teams, as they offer flexibility within our workforce and enable the Company to attract more geographically diverse talent.  Brown & Brown's top priority is the total well-being of our teammates, which means physical, emotional, social and financial health and wellness. We know that healthy teammates provide better support to their families, their communities and our customers, which results in our continued success as a Company. We encourage teammates to stay active, maintain a healthy work-life balance, volunteer in their local communities and prioritize their mental and physical health. This includes regular communication with teammates about the importance of physical, mental and financial wellness. In addition, our chief executive officer shares biweekly video updates to connect with our teammates and encourage the importance of health and well-being. Our Company encourages individuals to engage in activities that promote good mental health and, when needed, to seek out help from friends, teammates, family and medical professionals. Many of the services readily available to Brown & Brown teammates are bundled under the Company\u2019s Teammate Assistance Program. These include no-cost, confidential support services such as access to mental health counselors, a 24/7 crisis hotline, coaching, wellness activities, a library of videos and webinars on demand and more. The Company provides a crisis hotline \u201cAdvocate for Me,\u201d a service that provides one-on-one consultation with mental well-being case navigators, therapists and psychiatrists, alongside other programs. In 2021, we announced the creation of a Mental Health Allies group, which consists of a group of teammate volunteers that are ready to serve as points of contact for our mental health resources, as well as a support system for our teammates. Mental Health Allies complete mental health first aid training offered by the National Council for Behavioral Health. These teammates are available to listen impartially and support teammates, while also raising awareness regarding the importance of mental health and wellness. Mental Health Allies are not diagnosticians or emergency providers, but rather conduits who may assist teammates find the appropriate resources in a time of need. In addition, our new campus in Daytona Beach, Florida, completed in 2021, was designed with teammates in mind. Open floorplans encourage regular movement and interaction among our teammates, promoting a productive, collaborative work environment. Offices and workstations are equipped with ergonomic furniture and sit-stand desks, intentionally selected to support teammates' physical health. Many of our other offices are also embracing open floorplans as they enter into new leases or refresh their office space. We continue to engage our team of employed health care professionals to provide critical and timely guidance on the physiological and psychological implications of COVID-19. We also provide access to public COVID-19 resources through our website portal to benefit individuals and businesses coping with challenges resulting from the pandemic. To assist those who have found themselves in financial hardships, we provide discounted services and products through our Brown & Brown $avings Center to both teammates and the public. Workplace Safety  10 \u00a0 Across all Brown & Brown locations, our goal is to provide a safe environment for teammates and office visitors. The Company has formal workplace safety guidelines that apply to our teammates and facilities, with some offices establishing even more specific procedures for conduct. These guidelines cover, among other things, hazardous and unsafe work areas and conditions, cellphone usage, travel, attire, communication protocols for closures and emergencies and our workers' compensation benefits. Additionally, the Company has a formal policy against violence in the workplace. This policy prohibits any form of weapon from being carried or maintained in our Company's offices and prohibits teammates from making threats or engaging in violent activities. Under our policy, any teammate who believes they have been a victim of violence, threats of violence, intimidating conduct or has heard jokes or offensive comments about a violent occurrence must report such actions immediately to their team leader or another member of our Company's leadership team. In addition, any teammate who believes they or another teammate may be in imminent danger of violence must notify local law enforcement officials immediately. In 2022, the Company had no work-related fatalities and 24 injuries or occupational diseases, as determined based on the number of claims made under our workers\u2019 compensation policy, excluding claims that were closed and for which no payment was made.
