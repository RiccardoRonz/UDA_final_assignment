{"cik": 875320, "item_1A": "ITEM 1.BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. We have four approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (\u201cCF\u201d), a life-threatening genetic disease, and we continue to focus on developing additional treatments for CF. Beyond CF, we have a pipeline that includes mid- and late-stage clinical programs in sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, acute and neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and earlier-stage programs in diseases such as muscular dystrophies.  Our goal in CF is to develop treatment regimens that will provide benefits to all people with CF and will enhance the benefits currently provided to people taking our medicines. Our marketed medicines are TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor),\u00a0SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), ORKAMBI (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and KALYDECO (ivacaftor). Collectively, our CF medicines are being used to treat the majority of the approximately 88,000 people with CF in North America, Europe and Australia.  Through label expansions, approval of new medicines, and expanded reimbursement, we are focused on increasing the number of people with CF who are eligible and able to receive our medicines. We are evaluating our current medicines in additional patient populations, including younger children, with the goal of having small molecule treatments for all people who have at least one mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (\u201cCFTR\u201d) gene that is responsive to our CFTR modulators. We are evaluating a once-daily triple combination of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor, formerly known as VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561, in Phase 3 clinical trials. We believe this new triple-combination has the potential to provide enhanced benefits to CF patients who have at least one mutation in their CFTR gene. This regimen also carries a lower royalty burden. In addition, in December 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), cleared our Investigational New Drug Application (\u201cIND\u201d) for VX-522, a messenger ribonucleic acid (\u201cmRNA\u201d) therapeutic we are developing in collaboration with Moderna, Inc. (\u201cModerna\u201d), that has the potential to benefit the approximately 5,000 people with CF in North America, Europe and Australia who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Beyond CF, we are advancing programs across multiple disease areas and modalities, including: \u2022Sickle Cell Disease and Beta Thalassemia. We have completed enrollment in two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials of exagamglogene autotemcel (\u201cexa-cel\u201d), formerly known as CTX001, an investigational CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing therapy for severe sickle cell disease (\u201cSCD\u201d), and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (\u201cTDT\u201d). In the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed European regulatory submissions for exa-cel and initiated a rolling submission in the United States (the \u201cU.S.\u201d). The European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (\u201cMHRA\u201d) have validated the marketing authorization application (\u201cMAA\u201d) for exa-cel.  \u2022Pain. We are evaluating VX-548, a non-opioid, investigational NaV 1.8 inhibitor, for the treatment of pain. Our most advanced clinical trials in pain are three Phase 3 clinical trials of VX-548 as a potential treatment for moderate to severe acute pain. In addition, we have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating VX-548 in chronic neuropathic pain.  \u2022APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease. We are evaluating inaxaplin, formerly known as VX-147, our investigational small molecule for the treatment of APOL1-mediated kidney disease (\u201cAMKD\u201d) in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial.  \u2022Type 1 Diabetes. We are evaluating VX-880, an investigational stem-cell derived fully-differentiated islet cell therapy, for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (\u201cT1D\u201d) in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in which patients receive immunosuppressive therapy to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. Our Clinical Trial Application (\u201cCTA\u201d) in Canada for our second program in T1D, VX-264, in which the implanted islet cells are encapsulated in an immunoprotective device, was authorized and we plan to begin screening, enrollment and dosing in Canada in the coming months. In the U.S., the IND is on hold. 1 1  1   \u2022Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. We initiated a clinical trial for VX-634, which is the first in a series of next-wave investigational molecules with significantly improved potency and drug-like properties as compared to our previous Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (\u201cAAT\u201d) correctors. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-864, a first-generation AAT corrector, to assess the impact of longer-term treatment on the liver, as well as the levels of functional AAT in the plasma. \u2022Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1. We are conducting IND-enabling studies for our first in vivo gene-editing therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (\u201cDMD\u201d), and we expect to submit an IND for this program in 2023. We are exploring multiple approaches to address the underlying causal biology for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (\u201cDM1\u201d), including small molecules.  \u2022In addition to the programs listed above, we have a number of earlier-stage research programs aimed at diseases that fit our research and development strategy. Our core strategy is to discover and develop innovative medicines by combining transformative advances in the understanding of human disease and the science of therapeutics to dramatically advance human health. That strategy focuses on validated targets that address causal human biology, predictive lab assays and clinical biomarkers, rapid paths to registration and approval, and product candidates that hold the potential for transformative patient benefit. We plan to continue investing to advance our strategy, fostering scientific innovation by identifying additional product candidates through internal research efforts, and investing in business development transactions to access emerging technologies, products and product candidates. Our research and early development strategy includes advancing multiple compounds or therapies from each program into early clinical trials to obtain patient data that can inform selection of the most promising compounds for later stage development as well as inform our ongoing discovery and development efforts. We aim to rapidly follow our first-in-class therapies that achieve proof-of-concept with potential best-in-class candidates. This serial innovation approach is intended to increase the likelihood of successfully bringing transformative medicines to patients and provide durable clinical and commercial success. We continue to invest in active research to identify additional candidate therapies in support of the clinical stage programs described above and in other targets that are consistent with our core research strategy.  2 2  2    MARKETED PRODUCTS Our medicines are collectively being used by approximately two-thirds of people with CF in North America, Europe and Australia.

The existing EMA licenses continue to authorize supply in Northern Ireland.  Region/Initial Approval (1)       TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO is now approved and reimbursed or accessible in more than 30 countries outside the U.S. In addition to the European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d) and the U.S., we market our products in additional countries, including the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d), Australia, and Canada. We continuously seek to increase the number of patients eligible and able to receive our current medicines through label expansions, approval of new medicines and expanded reimbursement. Since the beginning of 2022, events that have resulted from our efforts include: \u2022The European Commission and the MHRA granted marketing authorization for KAFTRIO for the treatment of children with CF 6 through 11 years of age who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.  \u2022Health Canada granted marketing authorization for TRIKAFTA for people with CF 6 through 11 years of age who have at least one F508del mutation. \u2022The FDA approved the use of ORKAMBI for children with CF 12 to less than 24 months of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. 3 3  3   \u2022In the fourth quarter of 2022, we submitted global regulatory filings for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in children with CF 2 to 5 years of age and for KALYDECO in children with CF from 1 month to less than 4 months of age.   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS We invest in research and development to discover and develop transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. Our research strategy is to combine transformative advances in the understanding of human disease and in the science of therapeutics to dramatically advance human health. This approach has been validated through our success in moving novel product candidates into clinical trials and obtaining marketing approvals for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, and SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI for the treatment of CF and INCIVEK (telaprevir) for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. Our approach to drug discovery has been further validated by our successful demonstration of clinical proof-of-concept in six additional disease areas: in SCD and beta thalassemia with exa-cel, in acute and neuropathic pain with our NaV1.8 inhibitors, in AMKD with inaxaplin, and in T1D with a stem cell-derived islet cell therapy. We continue to research and develop small molecule product candidates for the treatment of serious diseases, including CF, pain, AMKD, AAT deficiency (\u201cAATD\u201d) and DM1. Our research and development approach includes pursuing multiple modalities tailored to the specific disease target under investigation, using clinical and non-clinical data to inform drug discovery and development, and advancing multiple candidates into clinical trials with the goal of bringing first-in-class followed by best-in-class therapies to patients.  Over the last several years, we have expanded our capabilities to include additional innovative therapeutic modalities with a focus on cell and genetic\u00a0therapies, which have the potential to treat, and in some cases, cure diseases by addressing the underlying cause of the disease. We have increased our internal investment in cell and genetic therapies, including establishment of a new research and current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) clinical manufacturing site in Boston, Massachusetts to bring together our portfolio of cell and genetic therapy technologies and teams. In addition, we have made several significant investments in external innovation, including: \u2022our collaborations with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (\u201cCRISPR\u201d) to access and develop therapeutics based on the CRISPR gene-editing technology, including an agreement under which we now lead the worldwide development, manufacturing and commercialization of exa-cel; \u2022our establishment of cell therapy programs for T1D through our acquisition of Semma;  \u2022our acquisition of ViaCyte, Inc. (\u201cViaCyte\u201d), a biotechnology company with intellectual property, tools, technologies and assets with potential to accelerate development of our stem-cell based T1D programs; \u2022our advancement of our genetic therapy programs for DMD and DM1, through our acquisition of Exonics, and our collaboration with Entrada Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cEntrada\u201d), focused on intracellular Endosomal Escape Vehicle (\u201cEEV\u201d) therapeutics for DM1; and \u2022our collaboration with Moderna for the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies. Consistent with our research and development strategy, all of our investments in research and development and in external innovation are designed to deliver a portfolio with greater likelihood of success. We focus on: \u2022validated targets that address causal human biology; \u2022predictive lab assays and clinical biomarkers; \u2022rapid path to registration and approval; and \u2022potential for transformative benefit regardless of modality. To augment our internal programs, we plan to continue acquiring businesses and technologies and collaborating with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations to advance research in our disease areas interest, as well as to access technologies needed to execute  4 4  4   on our strategy. We have established and we nurture such relationships with organizations around the world and intend to extend and leverage that experience to further our research efforts to discover transformational medicines for serious diseases. We will continue to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions and collaborations that may be similar to or different from the transactions that we have engaged in previously. The following chart represents our pipeline programs by disease area, stage of development, and modality, for programs that have lead assets in the clinic.   CF Pipeline CF is a life-shortening genetic disease caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. To develop CF, children must inherit two defective CFTR genes, which are referred to as alleles; one allele is inherited from each parent. The vast majority of patients with CF carry at least one F508del mutation. The F508del mutation results in a defect in the CFTR protein in which the CFTR protein does not reach the surface of the cells in sufficient quantities and does not adequately transport chloride ions.  The absence of working CFTR proteins results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of cells in a number of organs, including the lungs. As a result, thick, sticky mucus builds up and blocks the passages in many organs, leading to a variety of symptoms. In particular, mucus builds up and clogs the airways in the lungs, causing chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage. CFTR potentiators such as ivacaftor and deutivacaftor, formerly VX-561, increase the probability that the CFTR protein channels open on the cell surface, increasing the flow of salt and water into and out of the cell. CFTR correctors, such as lumacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor, and vanzacaftor, formerly VX-121, increase the proper protein processing and folding of mutant CFTR proteins, such that a larger amount of functional CFTR protein reaches the cell surface.  5 5  5   We have completed enrollment of two Phase 3 global, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials evaluating a once-daily investigational triple combination of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor. Clinical and preclinical data indicate that this triple combination has the potential to provide enhanced benefit beyond TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO for people with CF who have the F508del mutation on at least one allele. Our Phase 3 program consists of two 52-week clinical trials, SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103, which evaluate the safety and efficacy of the new combination relative to TRIKAFTA in approximately 950 people with CF 12 years of age and older. In parallel, we have initiated a clinical trial, RIDGELINE, evaluating vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in children with CF 6 to 11 years of age. We expect to complete the SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103 clinical trials by the end of 2023. We continue to identify and develop additional CFTR modulators with the goal of achieving carrier levels of CFTR activity for people with CF who respond to CFTR modulators. We continue to research genetic therapies, such as mRNA, and gene-editing approaches, to treat people with CF who do not make CFTR protein and, as a result, cannot benefit from our CFTR modulators. In collaboration with Moderna, we are developing VX-522, a CF mRNA therapeutic designed to treat the underlying cause of CF for these people by enabling cells in the lungs to produce functional CFTR protein. In December 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-522. We have initiated a single ascending dose clinical trial for VX-522 in people with CF, which is active and enrolling patients. We expect to complete the single ascending dose clinical trial and initiate the multiple ascending dose clinical trial in 2023. Sickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia SCD and beta thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies, a group of inherited blood disorders that result from gene mutations that alter hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen throughout the body.  SCD is caused by the change of a single amino acid in the hemoglobin gene that causes red cells to change shape in settings of low oxygen. These sickled cells block blood flow and can lead to severe pain, organ damage, and shortened life span. Treatment is typically focused on relieving pain and minimizing organ damage, requiring medication and, for some patients, monthly blood transfusions and frequent hospital visits. We estimate that there are approximately 25,000 patients with severe SCD in the U.S. and Europe. Beta thalassemia is caused by loss-of-function mutations in hemoglobin that lead to severe anemia in patients, which causes fatigue and shortness of breath. In infants, beta thalassemia causes failure to thrive, jaundice, and feeding problems. Complications of beta thalassemia can lead to an enlarged spleen, liver and/or heart, misshapen bones and delayed puberty. Treatment for beta thalassemia varies depending on the disease severity for each patient. Patients with TDT, the most severe form of the disease, require regular blood transfusions, as frequently as every two to four weeks. Repeated blood transfusions eventually cause an unhealthy buildup of iron in the patient, leading to organ damage. We estimate that there are approximately 7,000 patients with TDT in the U.S. and Europe. We are developing exa-cel, an investigational CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing therapy, for the treatment of severe SCD and TDT, with our collaborator, CRISPR. Our therapeutic approach involves isolating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (\u201cHSPCs\u201d), which give rise to red blood cells, from a patient, treating those cells ex vivo with CRISPR/Cas9 to modify the erythroid-specific enhancer in the BCL11A gene, and reintroducing the edited cells back into the patient. This approach has the potential to significantly increase levels of fetal hemoglobin in erythrocytes and reduce or eliminate symptoms associated with disease.  We are investigating exa-cel in two Phase 3 open-label clinical trials designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients 12 to 35 years of age with severe SCD (the CLIMB SCD-121 clinical trial) and TDT (the CLIMB THAL-111 clinical trial), respectively. Patients enrolled in the clinical trials first undergo a treatment that mobilizes a population of HSPCs from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Blood cells are collected from the patient\u2019s bloodstream and transferred to a manufacturing facility where the HSPCs are purified and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing is performed. Following manufacturing, the edited cells, now called exa-cel, are transferred back to the clinical site. Patients are preconditioned with a treatment that ablates their bone marrow prior to infusion of exa-cel. 6 6  6   Efficacy data presented to date support the profile of exa-cel as a potential one-time functional cure for people with severe SCD and TDT. Exa-cel safety data to date is generally consistent with an autologous stem cell transplant and myeloablative conditioning. We completed regulatory submissions to the EMA and the MHRA for exa-cel for SCD and TDT in the fourth quarter of 2022, and both the EMA and MHRA have validated the MAA. We also initiated the submission of a biologics licensing application (\u201cBLA\u201d) for exa-cel for SCD and TDT for rolling review by the FDA in November 2022, and we expect to complete the submission by the end of the first quarter of 2023. We are enrolling in two Phase 3 clinical trials of exa-cel in patients 5 to 11 years of age, one in SCD and a second in TDT. Pain Pain can be debilitating and develop from a variety of conditions. Patients with pain can be categorized as suffering from one of three types of pain: acute pain, chronic neuropathic pain (caused primarily by damage or dysfunction of the nervous system) or chronic musculoskeletal pain (caused primarily by damage to muscle, joints or bone). Acute pain usually resolves in days or weeks (for example, following surgery or an injury), while chronic pain generally lasts greater than three months due to unresolved or ongoing damage to tissues. Our lead program is in Phase 3 development in acute pain where available treatments may not work well, may cause significant side effects, and may carry the risk of addiction. In addition, there is the practice of over- and mis-utilization, as well as underutilization, of current acute pain medicines.  The sodium channels NaV1.8 and NaV1.7 play important roles in the physiology of pain. We have discovered multiple selective small molecule inhibitors of NaV1.8 as potential treatments for pain. We obtained pharmacological validation of NaV1.8 inhibition with one of our first generation NaV1.8 inhibitors in all three clinical pain types: acute pain, chronic neuropathic pain, and chronic musculoskeletal pain.  In early 2022, we reported positive data from two Phase 2 acute pain clinical trials for VX-548, a NaV1.8 inhibitor. Both Phase 2 trials met their primary endpoint and established proof-of-concept for VX-548 for the treatment of acute pain following bunionectomy or abdominoplasty surgery. In addition, VX-548 was generally well tolerated by patients in these studies. We have initiated two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of VX-548 for moderate to severe acute pain following bunionectomy or abdominoplasty surgery. The Phase 3 program for VX-548 also includes a single-arm study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of VX-548 in multiple other types of moderate to severe acute pain. We expect to complete these Phase 3 trials in late 2023 or early 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we also initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain. APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease  Inherited mutations in the APOL1 gene play a causal role in the biology of severe proteinuric kidney diseases referred to as AMKD. In AMKD, the kidney\u2019s filtering units known as the glomeruli, and within them, the cells known as podocytes, are damaged, leading to leakage of protein into the urine, deterioration in kidney function, scarring, and, ultimately, permanent kidney damage. Patients with proteinuria who inherited two copies of the APOL1 mutations demonstrate rapid progression to end stage kidney disease. Some patients with AMKD have the histological finding of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (\u201cFSGS\u201d) and co-morbidities such as hypertension. We are evaluating multiple novel small molecules that inhibit the function of APOL1 protein with the potential to treat APOL1-mediated kidney disease. In a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial, patients with APOL1-mediated FSGS treated with inaxaplin on top of standard of care achieved a statistically significant, substantial, and clinically meaningful reduction of proteinuria. In this clinical trial, inaxaplin was well tolerated by patients. Based on this positive Phase 2 data, we initiated pivotal development of inaxaplin in a single Phase 2/3 adaptive clinical trial in patients with AMKD in 2022. We continue to enroll patients in this Phase 2/3 clinical trial and we expect to complete the Phase 2 dose-ranging portion of the trial in 2023. Type 1 Diabetes T1D is a chronic, metabolic disorder caused by an absence of insulin secretion by the beta cells in the pancreas. In patients with T1D, the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the person\u2019s own immune system, resulting in a complete lack of insulin. While insulin therapy allows patients to live for decades with the disease, challenges of insulin therapy include inadequate control of blood sugar (both hyper- and hypo-glycemia), a substantial burden of care on patients and families, and long-term vascular complications.  We are developing fully differentiated stem-cell derived islet cell therapies designed to replace insulin-producing islet  7 7  7   cells that are destroyed in people with T1D, with the goal of delivering a functional cure. We are pursuing three programs for the transplant of functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone following immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device, and development of hypoimmune cells to optimize how we protect the implanted islet cells from the immune system. VX-880, our first program, is a stem cell-derived, allogeneic, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell replacement therapy, using standard immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells. Our Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating VX-880 as a potential treatment for T1D is ongoing and proof-of-concept has been achieved. In mid-2022, we provided data on the first two T1D patients dosed in this clinical trial, including that both patients had achieved glucose-responsive insulin production, improvements in glycemic control, and reductions in exogenous insulin requirements. VX-880 safety data to date is generally consistent with the immunosuppressive regimen used in the clinical trial. We have completed enrollment in Part B of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial and, after completion of Part B, we expect to begin Part C of the trial, with concurrent dosing, in 2023.  In our second program, we are evaluating VX-264, in which the stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cells are encapsulated and implanted in an immunoprotective device. In December 2022, our Clinical Trial Application (\u201cCTA\u201d) in Canada for this program was authorized and we plan to begin screening, enrollment and dosing in Canada in the coming months. In the U.S., the IND is on hold. In our third program, research in earlier stages is directed toward developing hypoimmune cells to further optimize how we protect the implanted islet cells from the immune system.  In the third quarter of 2022, we acquired ViaCyte, a biotechnology company focused on delivering novel stem cell-derived cell replacement therapies as a potential functional cure for T1D. We believe the acquisition will accelerate our goal of developing a functional cure for T1D. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VCTX-211, a hypoimmune cell program that we are developing in partnership with CRISPR, is active and enrolling patients. Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency AATD is a severe disease of the liver and lung, caused by inherited mutations in the SERPINA1 gene that encodes the AAT protein. People who inherit two mutant SERPINA1 alleles (one from each parent) develop AATD. Most people who develop AATD have two copies of a single mutation known as the Z allele. The Z-AAT mutation results in a protein folding defect in the AAT protein leading the misfolded AAT protein to accumulate in the liver (where it is produced at high levels), which can cause liver damage. As a result, the protein fails to reach other organs in adequate quantity and function, particularly the lungs, where the AAT protein\u2019s normal role is to protect the lungs from the digestive effects of certain proteases. The unchecked activity of these proteases can cause auto-digestion of lung tissue and may lead to emphysema or chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, and lung infections over time. Currently, there is no treatment that targets the underlying cause of the disease in both the liver and the lung. Available treatments are aimed at transiently increasing levels of AAT in the blood but have no effect in the liver. Patients living with AATD typically experience recurring hospital visits and a shortened life expectancy. We seek to develop medicines that treat the underlying cause of AATD throughout the body. We have discovered multiple small molecule correctors that restore folding of the mutant AAT protein, leading to increased production of functional AAT protein. The restoration of AAT protein folding in the liver and of systemic AAT function has the potential to benefit both the liver and lung diseases caused by AATD. We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for VX-634, which is the first in a series of next-wave investigational molecules with significantly improved potency and drug-like properties as compared to our previous AAT correctors, allowing potential exploration of the full dose response. We also have initiated a second Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-864, a first-generation AAT corrector, to assess the impact of longer-term treatment on the liver, as well as the levels of functional AAT in the plasma. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 DMD and DM1 are inherited diseases that result in the weakening and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time. In 2019, we acquired Exonics and expanded our collaboration with CRISPR and are focused on advancing gene-editing therapies aimed at treating the underlying cause of DMD by restoring expression of near-full length dystrophin protein. We have an internal small molecule program (and, as described below, we established a collaboration with Entrada) to address the functional impact of the causal mutation in the gene that causes DM1. We are conducting enabling studies for our first in vivo gene-editing therapy for DMD and we expect to submit an IND for this program in 2023. 8 8  8   We have established a collaboration with Entrada focused on intracellular EEV therapeutics for DM1, which includes ENTR-701, an EEV-investigational candidate for the treatment of DM1 in late preclinical development.    COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR MEDICINES Commercial Organization Our commercial organization focuses on supporting the appropriate use of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO in the markets where these products have been approved. Our sales and marketing organizations are responsible for promoting products to health care providers, ensuring our products are distributed effectively, and obtaining reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets. In the U.S., we sell our products primarily to a limited number of specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors. In international markets, we sell our products primarily through distributor arrangements and to retail pharmacies or pharmacy chains, as well as to hospitals and clinics, many of which are government-owned or supported. Our U.S. field-based CF commercial team is comprised of a small number of individuals to support commercialization of our medicines for CF. We focus our CF marketing efforts in the U.S. on a relatively small number of physicians and health care professionals who write most of the prescriptions for CF medicines. Many of these physicians and health care professionals are located at a limited number of accredited centers in the U.S. focused on the treatment of CF. In international markets, we or our distributors have small sales forces that support TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO in jurisdictions where these products are approved.  We market our products through personal interactions with physicians and allied health care professionals. In parallel, our government affairs and public policy group advocates for policies that promote life sciences innovation and increase awareness of the diseases on which we are focusing with state and federal legislatures, government agencies, public health officials and other policymakers. We also have established programs in the U.S. that provide our products to qualified uninsured or underinsured patients at no charge or at a reduced charge, based on specific eligibility criteria.  We also continue to prepare for the near-term launch opportunities presented by exa-cel for SCD and TDT, VX-548 for acute pain, and the triple combination of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor for CF. For example, we are expanding our commercial organization and capabilities to ensure launch readiness in preparation for the launch of exa-cel, which will focus on patients with severe forms of sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia in the U.S. and certain countries in Europe. The number of patients with severe disease and the geographic concentration of patients enables a specialty model and we are creating the infrastructure and support systems that we believe will lead to commercial success. Our field teams are actively engaged with key treatment centers, policymakers and third-party payors to ensure that stakeholders understand the significant burden of these diseases and to ensure that patients who may be eligible for exa-cel have access to this potentially curative therapy. Reimbursement Sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products will be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed health care organizations. Increasingly, these third-party payors are becoming stricter in the ways they evaluate and reimburse medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our revenues. Decisions by third-party payors to not cover a product could reduce physician usage of the product. Our CF medicines are broadly reimbursed by third-party payors in the U.S., including the federal government. We participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, Medicare, and other governmental pricing programs. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low-income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to the Centers for Medicare  9 9  9   & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), the federal agency that administers the Medicaid and Medicare programs.  Any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also must participate in the 340B drug pricing program (the \u201c340B program\u201d), and the Federal Supply Schedule (\u201cFSS\u201d) pricing program. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, requires participating companies to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for our covered outpatient drugs. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on pricing data calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. The FSS pricing program, which is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d), also requires participating companies to extend discounted prices to the VA, Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and Public Health Service. Similar to the 340B program, FSS prices are calculated utilizing pricing data reported by us to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. The Medicare Part\u00a0D program provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part\u00a0D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs such as our CF medicines. Unlike Medicare Part\u00a0A and B, Part\u00a0D coverage is not standardized. Part\u00a0D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part\u00a0D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part\u00a0D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part\u00a0D drugs, including CF, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part\u00a0D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutics committee. U.S. government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part\u00a0D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.  Private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. As a result, any reduction in payment that results from Part D reimbursement may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors for our products. Additionally, private payors, including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S., are adopting more aggressive utilization management techniques and are increasingly applying restrictive plan designs that can impact patients and manufacturers. They continue to push for significant discounts and rebates from manufacturers. As a consequence, these payors may not cover or adequately reimburse for use of our products or may do so at levels that disadvantage them relative to competitive products. The U.S. government has shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs for medicines and has enacted reforms at the state and federal level designed to, among other things, modify prescription drug reimbursement amounts and methodologies, and otherwise control health care costs. For example, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our products. In the future, it is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits of a competitor\u2019s product could adversely affect the sales of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) was enacted in March 2010 and was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall health care costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA was designed to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs, impose an annual fee on branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, subject biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part\u00a0D program. We anticipate that the U.S. government will continue to engage in activities seeking to address drug pricing and reimbursement. In Europe and other foreign jurisdictions, the success of our products depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because patients are generally unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. In some countries, such as Germany, commercial sales of a new product may begin while pricing and reimbursement terms are under discussion. In other countries, a company must complete reimbursement negotiations prior to the commencement of commercial supply of the pharmaceutical product. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely country-by-country and region-by-region. For example, the member states of the E.U. can restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and can control the prices of  10 10  10   prescription drugs. In addition, many ex-U.S. government payors require companies to provide health economic assessments of products, which are evaluated by government agencies set up for this purpose. A member state may approve a specific price for the drug, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the total amount of money that a company may receive for supply of a drug. Countries also may consider increasing mandatory discounts over time in an attempt to manage increased demands on healthcare budgets. Reimbursement discussions in foreign countries often result in a reimbursement price that is lower than the net price that companies can obtain for the product in the U.S. In addition, reimbursement discussions may take a significant period of time resulting in commercialization delays. Reimbursement for our products cannot be assured because a country or region may only provide for reimbursement on terms that we do not deem adequate. Further, many ex-U.S. governments have introduced or are in the process of introducing legislation focusing on cost containment measures in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of these laws where finalized, the final form of laws under consideration, and their relevant practical application, are unknown at this time, but may lead to lower prices, paybacks, or other forms of discounts or special taxes. We have obtained broad reimbursement for our CF medicines in ex-U.S. markets. TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO is reimbursed or accessible in more than 30 countries outside the U.S. We expect to continue to focus significant resources to obtain expanded reimbursement for our CF medicines and pipeline therapies in ex-U.S. markets. There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of our pipeline cell or genetic therapy products, including genetic therapies that are potential one-time treatments. It is difficult to predict how future novel cell and genetic therapy products will be covered and reimbursed by payors, including U.S. federal healthcare programs, ex-U.S. governments, or private insurance companies. Additionally, reimbursement rates for cell and genetic therapies approved before ours could create an adverse environment for reimbursement of any therapies we ultimately commercialize. The administration of our products may require procedures for the collection of cells from patients, followed by other procedures either before or after delivery of the cell or genetic therapy. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for these services also are important. An inadequate reimbursement for such services may adversely affect physicians\u2019 decisions to recommend any product for which we obtain approval in the future and our ability to market or sell the related cell or genetic therapy.    STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS AND COLLABORATIONS As part of our business strategy, we seek to license or acquire technologies, products, product candidates, and businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts. In addition, we establish business relationships with collaborators to support our research activities and to lead or support development and/or commercialization of certain product candidates. We expect to continue to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions, licenses and collaborations that may be similar or different from the transactions that we have engaged in previously. Strategic Transactions \u2022In 2017, we enhanced our CF portfolio through our acquisition of certain CF assets, including deutivacaftor, from Concert Pharmaceuticals Inc. We are in Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating our new, once-daily investigational triple combination therapy, which includes deutivacaftor, for people with CF 12 years of age and older.  \u2022In 2019, we established our T1D program through our acquisition of Semma, a privately held company focused on the use of stem cell-derived human islets as a potentially curative treatment for T1D. We are evaluating VX-880 for the potential treatment of T1D in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. In addition, we submitted an IND for our second program in T1D, VX-264, in which the implanted islet cells are encapsulated in an immunoprotective device. \u2022In 2019, we enhanced our gene-editing capabilities through our acquisition of Exonics, a privately held company focused on creating transformative gene-editing therapies to repair mutations that cause DMD and other severe neuromuscular diseases, including DM1. We are conducting enabling studies for our first in vivo gene-editing therapy for DMD and we expect to submit an IND for this program in 2023. \u2022In 2022, we acquired ViaCyte, a privately held company focused on delivering novel stem cell-derived cell replacement therapies as a functional cure for T1D, and Catalyst Biosciences, Inc.\u2019s portfolio of protease medicines that target the complement system and related intellectual property. 11 11  11   Collaboration and Licensing Arrangements Joint Development and Commercialization Agreement with CRISPR In December 2017, we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement (\u201cOriginal JDCA\u201d), with CRISPR pursuant to which we are co-developing and preparing to co-commercialize exa-cel, for SCD and TDT. We entered into the Original JDCA following our exercise of an option to co-develop and co-commercialize the hemoglobinopathies program that was contained in the collaboration agreement that we entered into with CRISPR in 2015.  In April 2021, we and CRISPR amended and restated the Original JDCA (the \u201cA&R JDCA\u201d). Pursuant to the A&R JDCA, the parties agreed to, among other things, (a) adjust the governance structure for the collaboration and adjust the responsibilities of each party thereunder; (b) adjust the allocation of net profits and net losses between the parties; and (c) exclusively license (subject to CRISPR\u2019s reserved rights to conduct certain activities) certain intellectual property rights to us relating to the products that may be researched, developed, manufactured and commercialized under such agreement.  Pursuant to the A&R JDCA, we lead global development, manufacturing and commercialization of exa-cel, with support from CRISPR. Subject to the terms and conditions of the A&R JDCA, we have the right to conduct all research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities relating to the product candidates and products under the A&R JDCA (including exa-cel) throughout the world, subject to CRISPR\u2019s reserved right to conduct certain activities. In connection with the A&R JDCA, we made a $900.0 million upfront payment to CRISPR in the second quarter of 2021. CRISPR has the potential to receive an additional one-time $200.0 million milestone payment upon receipt of the first marketing approval of exa-cel from the FDA or the European Commission. We and CRISPR shared equally all expenses incurred under the Original JDCA. On July 1, 2021, with respect to exa-cel, the net profits and net losses incurred pursuant to the A&R JDCA began to be allocated 60% to us and 40% to CRISPR, subject to certain adjustments, while all other product candidates and products continue to have net profits and net losses shared equally between the parties.  Either party may terminate the A&R JDCA upon the other party\u2019s material breach, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or, in our case, in the event that CRISPR becomes subject to specified bankruptcy, winding up, or similar circumstances. Either party may terminate the A&R JDCA in the event the other party commences or participates in any action or proceeding challenging the validity or enforceability of any patent that is licensed to such challenging party pursuant to the A&R JDCA. We also have the right to terminate the A&R JDCA for convenience at any time after giving prior written notice. If circumstances arise pursuant to which a party would have the right to terminate the A&R JDCA on account of an uncured material breach, such party may elect to keep the A&R JDCA in effect and cause such breaching party to be treated as if it had exercised its opt-out rights with respect to the products associated with such uncured material breach and the royalties payable to the breaching party would be reduced by a specified percentage. Either party may opt out of the development of a product candidate under the A&R JDCA after predetermined points in the development of the product candidate, on a candidate-by-candidate basis. In the event of such opt-out, the party opting-out will no longer share in the net profits and net losses associated with such product candidate and, instead, the opting out party will be entitled to high single to mid-teen percentage royalties on the net sales of such product, if commercialized. In-License Agreements We have entered into various agreements pursuant to which we have obtained access to technologies from third parties and are conducting research and development activities with collaborators. Pursuant to these arrangements, we have obtained development and commercialization rights to resulting product candidates. Depending on the terms of the arrangements, we may be responsible for the costs of research activities, required to make upfront payments and/or milestone payments upon the achievement of certain research, development, and commercial objectives, and/or pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration. Our current in-license agreements include: \u2022CRISPR Therapeutics AG. In addition to our arrangement with CRISPR described above, we have exercised options to exclusively license treatments for specific targets, including CF, that were subject to the research program under the collaboration agreement we entered into with CRISPR in 2015. In 2019, we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to CRISPR\u2019s intellectual property for DMD and DM1 gene-editing products through a new agreement with CRISPR.  12 12  12   \u2022Moderna, Inc. In 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Moderna for the identification and development of mRNA therapeutics encoding CFTR for the treatment of CF. In December 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-522, an mRNA therapeutic we are developing with Moderna pursuant to this collaboration, and we have initiated a single ascending dose clinical trial for VX-522 in people with CF. In 2020, we entered into a new collaboration with Moderna aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. \u2022Entrada Therapeutics, Inc. We established a collaboration with Entrada, focused on intracellular EEV therapeutics for DM1, which includes ENTR-701, an EEV-investigational candidate for the treatment of DM1 in late preclinical development.  \u2022Other Arrangements. We have also entered into other arrangements to support our research and development efforts. In 2022, we entered into a collaboration with Verve Therapeutics, Inc. In 2021, we entered into collaborations with Obsidian Therapeutics, Inc. and Mammoth Biosciences, Inc. In 2020, we entered into collaborations with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc and Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc. In 2019, we entered into collaborations with Ribometrix, Inc. and Kymera Therapeutics. Out-license Agreements We have entered into various agreements pursuant to which we have out-licensed rights to certain product candidates to third-party collaborators. Pursuant to these out-license arrangements, our collaborators are responsible for all costs related to the continued development of such product candidates and obtain development and commercialization rights to these product candidates. Depending on the terms of the arrangements, our collaborators may be required to make upfront payments, milestone payments upon the achievement of certain research and development objectives and/or pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products licensed under the agreement.  Cystic Fibrosis Foundation In 2004, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, as successor in interest to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., to support research and development activities. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, as amended, we have agreed to pay tiered royalties ranging from single digits to sub-teens on covered compounds first synthesized and/or tested during a research term on or before February 28, 2014, including ivacaftor, lumacaftor and tezacaftor and royalties ranging from low-single digits to mid-single digits on potential net sales of certain compounds first synthesized and/or tested between March 1, 2014 and August 31, 2016, including elexacaftor. We do not have any royalty obligations on compounds first synthesized and tested on or after September 1, 2016. For combination products, such as ORKAMBI, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI and TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, sales are allocated equally to each of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in the combination product.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Patents and other proprietary rights such as trademarks, trade secrets, and copyrights are critical to our business. We actively seek protection for our products and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as appropriate. In addition, we rely upon trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information and products.  Patents provide a period of exclusivity that can make it more difficult for competitors to market and use our technology. We own and control patents and pending patent applications that relate to compounds, formulations, treatment of diseases, synthetic routes, intermediates, and other inventions. To protect our intellectual property, we typically apply for patents several years before a product receives marketing approval. Under current law, a patent expires 20 years from its first effective filing date. Since the drug development process may last for many years, there may be a period of time in which we have an issued patent but not marketing approval to sell the drug. To compensate for patent term lost while a product is in clinical trials and undergoing review for marketing approval, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. In addition to patent protection, we have regulatory exclusivity from U.S. and European regulatory agencies for the active pharmaceutical agents and, where applicable, their approved orphan indications for a certain time period. Regulatory exclusivity runs concurrently with patent exclusivity and provides complementary protection. 13 13  13   We own or hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to several hundred patents in the U.S. Upon approval of a New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d), or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant\u2019s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book. We have eleven issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in KALYDECO, its marketed formulations, and/or its approved indication. We have 20 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in ORKAMBI, its marketed formulations, and/or its approved indication. We have 21 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in SYMDEKO, its marketed formulation, and/or its approved indication. We have 24 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in TRIKAFTA, its marketed formulation, and/or its approved indication. The table below sets forth the year of projected expiration for the basic product patents covering each of our approved products. For products that are combinations of two or more active ingredients, the table lists the projected expiration of the latest expiring patent covering any of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (lumacaftor for ORKAMBI, tezacaftor for SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI and elexacaftor for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO). Unless otherwise noted, patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificates, and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below and may extend protection. In some instances, we also own later-expiring patents and applications relating to solid forms, formulations, methods of manufacture, or the use of these drugs in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. In some cases, however, such patents may not protect our drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent.

In addition to protecting our marketed products, we actively file patent applications in the U.S. and in foreign countries on inventions relating to our pipeline. For example, we also own and/or control U.S. and foreign patents and/or patent applications relating to the following: \u2022Vanzacaftor, deutivacaftor, and other CF potentiators and correctors and many other related compounds, and the use of those compounds for the treatment CF. \u2022VX-522 and other mRNA-based approaches for treating CF. \u2022Exa-cel and other potential gene-editing approaches for treating hemoglobinopathies. \u2022VX-548 and other compounds being studied for the potential treatment of pain.  \u2022Inaxaplin and other compounds being studied for the potential treatment of AMKD. \u2022VX-880, VX-264, and other cell-based approaches for treating T1D. \u2022VX-634 and other compounds being studied for the potential treatment of AATD. \u2022Other pre-clinical and clinical candidates and the use of such candidates to treat specified diseases. \u2022The manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions, related solid forms, formulations, dosing regimens, and methods of use of many of the above compounds. We and CRISPR intend to rely upon a combination of rights, including patent rights, trade secret protection, and  14 14  14   regulatory exclusivities to protect exa-cel. CRISPR has licensed certain rights to a worldwide patent portfolio that covers various aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 editing platform technology including, for example, compositions of matter and methods of use, including their use in targeting or cutting DNA, from Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier. In addition to Dr. Charpentier, this patent portfolio has named inventors who assigned their rights to the Regents of the University of California or the University of Vienna, to whom we refer, together with Dr. Charpentier, as the CVC Group. CRISPR has non-exclusive or co-exclusive rights to the patent rights that protect the core CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. For example, certain third parties, including competitors, have reported obtaining a license to rights in this patent portfolio in certain fields. In addition, patents and patent applications in this patent portfolio are the subject of proceedings in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions, including proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d), between the CVC Group and, separately, the Broad Institute, Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC (\u201cSigma-Aldrich\u201d), and ToolGen, Inc. (\u201cToolGen\u201d). To date, both the CVC Group and the Broad Institute have obtained granted patents that purport to cover aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 editing platform technology. The patents and patent applications within the patent portfolios of the CVC Group, the Broad Institute, Sigma-Aldrich and/or ToolGen are, or may in the future be, involved in proceedings similar to interferences or priority disputes in Europe or other foreign jurisdictions. In addition to the patent portfolio licensed from Dr. Charpentier, we own patents and/or patent applications relating to the composition, manufacture, and use of exa-cel. From time to time, we enter into exclusive and non-exclusive license agreements for proprietary third-party technology used in connection with our research activities. These license agreements typically provide for the payment by us of a license fee but may also include terms providing for milestone payments or royalties for the development and/or commercialization of our drug products arising from the related research. We cannot be certain that issued patents we own or license will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. The existence of patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of intellectual property rights that may be claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products.    MANUFACTURING  As we market and sell our approved products and advance our product candidates through clinical development toward commercialization, we continue to build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources. We rely on internal capabilities and a global network of third parties to manufacture and distribute our product candidates for clinical trials, as well as our products for commercial sale and post-approval clinical trials. In addition to establishing supply chains for each new approved product, we must adapt our supply chain for existing products to include additional formulations that are often required to treat younger patients or to increase scale of production for existing products. We are focused on ensuring the stability of the supply chains for our current products, including TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, and for our pipeline programs.\u00a0In addition, we are focused on identifying and ensuring efficient manufacturing and delivery processes for the cell and genetic therapies we are developing. We have established our own manufacturing capabilities in Boston, which we use for clinical trial and commercial supplies, including our commercial supply of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO. We have established and continue to evaluate additional manufacturing capacity for our current and future products.\u00a0We expect that we will continue to rely on third parties to meet our commercial supply needs, including for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, and a significant portion of our clinical supply needs for the foreseeable future.\u00a0 Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing our products, including obtaining all necessary supplies, is a multi-step global endeavor. In general, these raw materials and other necessary supplies are available from multiple sources. Third-party contract manufacturers, including some in China, perform different parts of our manufacturing process.\u00a0Contract manufacturers may supply us with raw materials, convert these raw materials into drug substance and/or convert the drug substance or product into final dosage form. In addition, third parties assist us with packaging, warehousing, and global distribution of our products. Establishing and managing this global supply chain for each of our products and product candidates requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. To manufacture  15 15  15   our commercial products, we utilize both continuous manufacturing technology as well as batch manufacturing processes.\u00a0 We have developed systems and processes to track, monitor, and oversee our and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities, including a quality assurance program intended to ensure that our third-party manufacturers comply with cGMP.\u00a0We devote substantial time, resources and effort in the areas of production, quality control, and quality assurance to maintain cGMP compliance. We regularly evaluate the performance of our third-party manufacturers with the objective of confirming their continuing capabilities to meet our needs efficiently and economically.\u00a0Manufacturing facilities, both foreign and domestic, are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and other U.S. and foreign government authorities. Although we actively engage with regulatory authorities, the timing of inspections and regulatory approvals for each of these facilities may be delayed for a number of reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The manufacturing processes for cell and genetic therapies are more complex than those required for small molecule drugs and require different systems, equipment, facilities, and expertise. Additionally, we are unable to utilize a single process for all of our cell and genetic therapies; they must be customized for each program and therapy. We are investing and plan to continue to invest significant resources in expanding and strengthening our manufacturing supplies, infrastructure and capabilities, such as cGMP clinical manufacturing, both independently and through third-party networks, in an effort to develop and commercialize our cell and genetic therapies. We are focused on identifying, evaluating and securing relationships with various third parties globally that will enable us to expand and strengthen such capabilities to support our current and future cell and genetic therapy programs, including exa-cel.  We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce or process cell culture reagents, gene-editing components, such as Cas9 protein and guide RNA molecules, and to generate gene-edited cells to supply exa-cel for clinical trials. If approved, we expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial supply of exa-cel. The manufacturing process for exa-cel involves a number of steps prior to the final infusion of drug product into patients. Following mobilization and collection of blood cells from the patient at the clinical site, cells are transferred to a manufacturing site where HSPCs are purified and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing is performed. The edited cellular product, called exa-cel, is frozen and transported back to the clinical site where it is stored prior to infusion into the patient. Each step must be completed successfully, and in a timely manner, requiring coordination between us, clinical sites, third-party manufacturers and shipping vendors. To increase production to commercial levels, we are making significant investments to coordinate manufacturing, testing, and logistics activities at a larger scale across multiple facilities to serve the geographies in which we plan to seek approval for exa-cel. In addition to clinical data establishing the safety and efficacy of exa-cel, approval of exa-cel will require regulatory approval of the processes and facilities used to manufacture and test critical gene-editing components and exa-cel.   COMPETITION The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive research efforts, rapid technological progress, and intense competition. There are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our drugs are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, other public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in a larger concentration of resources among a smaller number of our competitors. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and human resources than we do.  We believe that competition in our industry is based on, among other factors, innovative research, the effective and rapid development of product candidates, the ability to market and obtain reimbursement for products and the ability to establish effective patent protection. We face competition based on the safety and efficacy of our product and product candidates, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price, patent protection and other factors. Our competitors may develop or commercialize more effective, safer or more affordable products than we are able to develop or commercialize or obtain more effective patent protection. As a result, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we do, which would adversely affect our competitive position, the likelihood that our product candidates, if approved, would achieve and maintain market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful revenues from our products. Future competitive products may render our products, or future products, obsolete or noncompetitive. Another key element of remaining competitive in our industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientific, technical and management personnel to conduct our research activities and advance our  16 16  16   development programs, including with the commercial expertise to effectively market our products.  Cystic Fibrosis A number of companies are seeking to identify and develop product candidates for the treatment of CF, including CFTR modulators and other therapies intended to address the underlying causes of CF. AbbVie, Inc. (\u201cAbbVie\u201d) has been conducting Phase 2 clinical trials of a potentiator and a corrector and has announced plans to initiate Phase 2 clinical trials of a combination of a potentiator and two correctors in 2023. Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. was developing potential CFTR modulator therapies prior to its acquisition by Yumanity Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cYumanity\u201d). Following the merger, Yumanity out-licensed the CF program to Fair Therapeutics. Sionna Therapeutics has a CFTR modulator in Phase 1 development. Other therapeutic approaches include addressing CF utilizing nucleic acid therapies, which are compounds that allow expression of a functional CFTR protein. Nucleic acid therapies are under development by companies such as Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., ReCode Therapeutics, Inc., Krystal Biotech, Inc., Spirovant Sciences, Inc. Boehringer Ingelheim International, GmbH, 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Inc and SpliSense, Ltd.  Our success in rapidly developing and commercializing our products may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of these potential treatments for CF. In addition, clinical trials conducted by our competitors could take place simultaneously with our own trials, and may slow down our pace of development if we are unable to recruit sufficient clinical trial subjects. If one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for people with CF, our revenues from our current products and/or additional CF products, if then approved, could face significant competitive pressure. Pipeline In recent years, we have committed significant research resources to, and made significant investments in, our pipeline of potential new therapies for SCD, TDT, pain, AMKD, T1D, AATD, muscular dystrophies, and other diseases.  Sickle Cell and Beta Thalassemia There are multiple approved small molecule and biologic treatments for SCD and beta thalassemia, including products from Novartis International AG (\u201cNovartis\u201d), Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., which was recently acquired by Pfizer, and Bristol Myers Squibb together with Merck & Co. In addition, bluebird bio, Inc. (\u201cbluebird\u201d), obtained FDA approval of its gene therapy, Zynteglo (betibeglogene autotemcel) in August 2022 for the treatment of patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions. bluebird is also developing a gene therapy for SCD and previously announced that it expects to file the BLA with the FDA in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, various companies and private academic/medical institutes are developing gene therapy or gene-editing candidates for the treatment of SCD or beta thalassemia utilizing CRISPR technology, lentiviral vectors, zinc finger nuclease technology, or transcription activator-like effector nuclease, gene correction, base or prime editing. Pain The acute pain market is dominated by conventional analgesics, including opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and local anesthetics, low-cost generics, and reformulations aiming to provide safer, more tolerable or more convenient therapies. Several companies, including Orion Corporation and Luzsana Biotechnology, are pursuing clinical development of novel mechanisms of action for acute and chronic pain indications, including targeting the sodium channels in the NaV family, and there are two selective NaV1.8 inhibitors in clinical trials targeting pain indications.  Additional Programs Certain of our other product candidates face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. For example, other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are actively engaged in the research and development of products for T1D, including strategies to prevent the destruction of beta cells, to protect beta cell function, or to replace missing beta cells. The T1D standard of care of exogenous insulin injections continues to progress toward an artificial pancreas as multiple companies are developing novel insulin formulations, advanced pumps and glucose sensors, and closed loop systems. 17 17  17   There are no approved therapies targeting AMKD. People with chronic kidney disease (\u201cCKD\u201d) take angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers to treat hypertension; steroids and immunosuppressants to reduce proteinuria; and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of CKD progression. These CKD treatments may reduce proteinuria, but do not stop the rapid disease progression seen in AMKD patients. We are aware of two companies that have early programs developing APOL1-targeted assets for patients with AMKD: AstraZeneca in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, and Maze Therapeutics.  Several new therapies are under development specifically for the treatment of patients with FSGS. We are not aware of any of these therapies having a mechanism of action targeting those FSGS patients with high-risk variants for APOL1. Travere\u2019s sparsentan is currently under regulatory review. Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Janus kinase inhibitor (baricitinib) is being investigated by Duke University in FSGS patients with APOL1-risk variants. Many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are investing resources for the discovery and development of small molecules and cell and gene therapies to treat the same disease areas for which we are developing therapies in our pipeline. If any of these competitors develop or successfully commercialize products involving therapies competitive with our pipeline therapies, the potential return on our investment in those pipeline therapies could be impacted.   GOVERNMENT REGULATION Our operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the U.S., Europe and other countries. In the U.S., Europe and other countries, our products are subject to rigorous regulations governing their testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, and advertising and promotion. As a result of these regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming. The regulatory requirements applicable to drug and biologic development, approval, and marketing are subject to change. In addition, regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA or comparable ex-U.S. regulations, guidance or interpretations will change. United States Government Regulation New Drug Application and Biologics License Application Approval Processes The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: \u2022completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (\u201cGLP\u201d), and other applicable regulations; \u2022submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials in the U.S. may begin; \u2022performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (\u201cGCP\u201d), and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; \u2022submission to the FDA of an NDA or a BLA; \u2022satisfactory completion of a pre-approval FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and \u2022FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. Once a drug or biologic is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal pharmacology and toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND, which seeks FDA approval to test the drug or biologic in humans. Preclinical or nonclinical testing typically continues even after the IND is submitted.  If the FDA accepts the IND, the drug or biologic can then be studied in human clinical trials to determine if the product candidate is safe and effective. Clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years and are  18 18  18   expensive. These three phases, which are subject to considerable regulation, are as follows: \u2022Phase\u00a01. The drug or biologic initially is introduced into a limited number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some drugs or biologics for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the drug or biologic may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. \u2022Phase\u00a02. Clinical trials are next initiated in a limited patient population with the specified disease or condition the drug or biologic is intended to treat to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug or biologic candidate for the disease or condition it is intended to treat and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. \u2022Phase\u00a03. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug or biologic and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling. It is possible that Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period or while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold or suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the healthy volunteers or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, and the occurrence of serious adverse events must also be reported. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. The results of drug or biologic development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug or biologic, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the drug or biologic. The FDA reviews each NDA or BLA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts it for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a drug or biologic is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the drug or biologic\u2019s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA or BLA should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the drug or biologic is manufactured and tested. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. The FDA may require, as a condition of approval, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising or commitments to conduct additional research post-approval. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form.  Expedited Review and Approval The FDA has developed a number of distinct approaches to make new drugs or biologics available as rapidly as possible in cases where there is no available treatment or there are advantages over existing treatments. The FDA may grant \u201caccelerated approval\u201d to products that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. For accelerated  19 19  19   approval, the product must have an effect on a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe the clinical benefit. These studies are known as \u201cconfirmatory trials.\u201d Approval of a drug may be withdrawn, or the labeled indication of the drug changed if these trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug or biologic.  The FDA may grant \u201cfast track\u201d status to products that treat serious diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product\u2019s development plan and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of an NDA or BLA for FDA review before the entire submission is completed. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval. \u201cBreakthrough Therapy\u201d designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs or biologics that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all of the benefits of fast-track designation in addition to robust FDA-sponsor interaction and communication to help to identify the most efficient and expeditious path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. \u201cRegenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy,\u201d (\u201cRMAT\u201d) designation is a process created by the 21st Century Cures Act in December 2016. A product is eligible for RMAT designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious disease or condition, and if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of RMAT designation include the benefits available to breakthrough therapies, including potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.  The FDA may grant \u201cpriority review\u201d status to a product that, if approved, would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review an NDA or BLA, with the goal to take action on the application within six months from when the application is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. Manufacturing Quality Control Among the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer\u2019s quality control and manufacturing procedures continually conform with cGMP. Manufacturers must devote substantial time, money and effort in the areas of production, quality control, and quality assurance to maintain cGMP compliance. Material changes in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, may result in additional regulatory review and approval. The FDA, and other regulatory agencies, conduct periodic visits to inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. If a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance with the applicable regulations and requirements imposed when the product was approved, regulatory or judicial enforcement action may be initiated, which may include a warning letter, suspension of manufacturing, product seizure, or an injunction against shipment of products from the facility and/or recall of products previously shipped. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of our products. Future FDA, state, and foreign inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt manufacture or distribution of our products or require substantial resources to correct. Post-approval Requirements Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, the sponsor of an approved drug in the U.S. may not promote that drug for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an off-label use in accordance with the practice of medicine. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Further, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to  20 20  20   further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0record-keeping requirements; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0reporting of adverse experiences with the product; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0drug sampling and distribution requirements; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the drug or biologic development process, approval process or after approval, may subject us or our collaborators to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0restrictions on marketing or manufacturing of the product;  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0refusal to approve or delay in review of pending applications; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0withdrawal of an approval or the implementation of limitations on a previously approved indication for use; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0imposition of a clinical hold, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (\u201cREMS\u201d) or other safety-related limitations; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0warning letters or \u201cuntitled letters\u201d; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0product seizures, recalls, or detentions, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0total or partial suspension of production or distribution;  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0injunctions, fines, disgorgement, refusals of government contracts, or civil or criminal penalties. United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity Upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an IND for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. If the FDA approves a drug product that contains a new chemical entity not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA\u2019s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant.  Biologics are also entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the \u201cBPCIA\u201d),  21 21  21   which was passed as Title VII to the ACA. The law provides a pathway for approval of products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity, the period of time during which an innovator\u2019s clinical data cannot be used by other companies, from the time of first licensure of the product, and an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed \u201cinterchangeable\u201d by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed below. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar. There have been ongoing federal legislative and administrative efforts as well as judicial challenges seeking to repeal, modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. While none of those efforts have focused on changes to the provisions of the ACA related to the biosimilar regulatory framework, if the ACA is repealed, substantially modified, or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation. If the NDA or BLA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days each existing exclusivity (patent and regulatory) related to the product. Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.  If a drug or biologic that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug or biologic for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of our products for seven years if a competitor first obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, for the same disease or condition for which we were seeking approval. KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, SYMDEKO, and TRIKAFTA have been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA. We may pursue orphan drug designation for certain of our future product candidates. Even if we obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for the product candidate for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing novel therapies. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent different drugs from being approved for the same condition. Moreover, orphan drug exclusivity may not prevent the approval of another sponsor\u2019s product that is considered to be the same drug for a different disease or condition, even where such product could be used off-label for the indication that is protected by orphan drug exclusivity. Even after an orphan drug is approved, regulators may subsequently approve the same drug made by another manufacturer for the same condition if the regulator concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug or biologic nor gives the drug or biologic any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. Foreign Regulation We conduct clinical trials and market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have clinical trial, product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Thus, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the E.U., before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Under the E.U. regulatory system, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for orphan medicines, medicines produced by  22 22  22   biotechnology, and those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes, and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. In addition to the centralized procedure, the E.U. also has a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to and approval determination by each country; a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision. Additionally, our European headquarters and European research facility are located in the U.K. Despite the U.K. formally withdrawing from the E.U. on January 31, 2020, a number of E.U. regulations were retained in U.K. law. It is intended that these retained provisions be removed from or replaced in U.K. law at the end of 2023, which may increase regulatory divergence between the U.K. and the E.U. Given the current uncertainty as to what changes may be incorporated into U.K. law, it is unclear if any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Other Regulations Pharmaceutical companies are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare \u201cfraud and abuse,\u201d including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (\u201cAKS\u201d), the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), and other state and federal laws and regulations. In the U.S., the Anti-Kickback Statute generally makes it illegal to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in return for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal health care program. The FCA prohibits knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the FCA may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity, manufacturing regulations, or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. Laws and regulations also have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers, require manufacturers to adopt certain compliance standards or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include U.S. federal and state \u201csunshine\u201d provisions. The federal sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician practitioners. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain requirements that are subject to interpretation. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws. We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA\u2019s definition of a foreign government official. We are also subject to U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cthe Bribery Act\u201d), which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the U.K. generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. We are subject to federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the 340 program, and the FSS pricing program, that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs. 23 23  23   Our collection and use of personal data as part of our business activities is subject to various privacy and data security laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies, in the U.S., E.U., U.K., Canada, Australia, Brazil and other jurisdictions. Such laws and regulations have the potential to affect our business materially, continue to evolve and increasingly are being enforced. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances are or may be applicable to our activities. In addition, as we expand our pipeline and contemplate different approaches that may incorporate the use of medical devices, such approaches may necessitate compliance with regulatory laws applicable to medical devices, including those governing the testing, manufacture, approval, distribution, and marketing of medical devices. Furthermore, the extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted. We have a global corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent, and mitigate healthcare fraud and abuse risk through, among other things, the implementation of compliance policies and systems and through the promotion of a culture of compliance. We will continue to devote substantial resources to enhance and expand our corporate compliance program as necessary to help us manage and mitigate our evolving compliance risk environment as our business grows and expands globally. Even with these measures, however, we cannot guarantee compliance with the various complex laws and regulations to which we are subject now or in the future.   EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,800 employees. Of these employees, approximately 3,900 were based in the U.S. and approximately 900 were based outside the U.S. None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A small number of employees outside the U.S. are covered by such agreements due to local law or industry requirements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry and from universities and research institutions. Over the last several years, the challenges in recruiting and retaining employees across the biotechnology industry have increased substantially due to current industry job market dynamics. We rely on skilled, experienced, and innovative employees to conduct the operations of our company.

We are committed to building an outstanding, committed, and passionate team at Vertex, and we focus on a culture that values inclusion, diversity, and equity. We believe that each employee brings unique perspectives and strengths, and by embracing these strengths, we can do our best work for patients. We focus on recruiting, retaining, and developing employees from a diverse range of backgrounds to conduct our research, development, commercial, and other business activities.

On our Board of Directors, four of our eleven members are women and five members are from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 54% of our global workforce and 39% of our leadership (VP and above).

To promote our employees\u2019 continued well-being and development, we offer a variety of inclusive benefits and opportunities. We offer comprehensive work-life benefits, including health, dental, and income protection, such as life insurance and retirement savings programs and we enhanced and expanded those employee benefits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We continually review and augment our programs to include benefits such as expanded parental bonding and increased support for family planning. We have also expanded our gender affirming benefits.
