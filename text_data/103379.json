LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS  As part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of VF-owned brands, we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective sourcing, distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally. We provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products.Licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands and are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years, with conditional renewal options, outside of certain licensing arrangements for the Dickies\u00ae brand that have longer terms. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based on its sales of licensed products, with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement. Royalties generally range from 4% to 10% of the licensing partners\u2019 net licensed product sales. Royalty income was $75.0 million in Fiscal 2023 (less than 1% of total revenues), primarily from the Vans\u00ae, Dickies\u00ae and Timberland\u00ae\u00a0brands.

SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION       Product design and innovation, including fit, fabric, finish and quality, are important elements across our businesses. These functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe.VF\u2019s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for procuring and delivering products to support our brands and businesses. VF is skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain. In Fiscal 2023, VF sourced approximately 362 million units spread across our brands. Our products were primarily obtained from approximately 340 independent contractor manufacturing facilities in approximately 35 countries. Additionally, we operate 21 distribution centers and 1,265 retail stores across the globe. We also utilize distribution centers managed by third parties, as necessary, for certain brands and locations. Managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development, forecasting, order management and warehouse management, along with our core enterprise resource management platforms.Products obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in Asia. However, contracting in the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels for the U.S. market. The use of contracted production with different geographic regions and cost structures, provides a flexible approach to product sourcing. We will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment.Independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished, ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF's sourcing hub in Singapore (with satellite offices across Asia), and to a lesser extent, VF's sourcing hubs in Panama and Switzerland. These hubs are responsible for managing the procurement of product, supplier oversight, product quality assurance, sustainability within the supply chain, responsible sourcing and transportation and shipping functions. In addition, our hubs leverage proprietary knowledge and technology to enable certain contractors to more effectively control costs and improve labor efficiency. Management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties, tariffs and quotas. We limit VF\u2019s sourcing exposure through, among other measures: (i) diversifying production among countries and contractors, (ii)\u00a0sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available, and (iii)\u00a0sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements. VF does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the U.S. State Department.No single supplier represented more than 6% of our total cost of goods sold during Fiscal 2023.All independent contractor facilities that manufacture VF products, are subject to VF\u2019s Global Compliance Principles.

SEASONALITY SEASONALITY  VF\u2019s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual brands, and are historically stronger in the second half of the calendar year. This variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our Outdoor segment, where revenues are historically weighted towards the second and third fiscal quarters. On a quarterly basis in Fiscal 2023, revenues ranged from a low of 19% of full year revenues in the first fiscal quarter to a high of 30% in the third fiscal quarter, with corresponding operating margins of 3% in the first fiscal quarter and 15% in the third fiscal quarter. This variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our Outdoor segment, where 14% of the segment's revenues occurred in the first fiscal quarter compared to 35% in the third fiscal quarter of Fiscal 2023. With changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends.Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital typically increases early in the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the calendar year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Historically, cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the calendar year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements, particularly during the fourth quarter of the calendar year.

ADVERTISING, CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH ADVERTISING, CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH  During Fiscal 2023, our advertising and promotion expense was $861.8 million, representing 7% of total revenues. We advertise in consumer and trade publications and through digital initiatives, including social media and mobile platforms on the Internet. We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media, radio and television. We sponsor sporting, musical and special events, as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products. We employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending, and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments.We provide advertising support to our wholesale customers, including independent partnership stores, in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products. We also participate in shop-in-shops and concession retail arrangements, which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific VF brand within our customers' stores and other locations, to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products.We contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers, including cooperative advertising funds, discounts and allowances. We also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of discounts, rebates and coupon offers that are eligible for use in certain VF-operated stores, brand e-commerce sites and concession retail locations. VF also offers loyalty programs for certain brands that provide a range of benefits to consumers.In addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands, VF and its associates actively support our communities and various charities. For example, The North Face\u00ae brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation, such as The North Face Explore Fund\u2122 program, and provide trailblazing athletes with funding, gear, education and mentorship to accelerate their progress through its \"Athlete Development Program\". The Timberland\u00ae brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism, including the Path of Service\u2122 program, which celebrated its 30-year anniversary in Fiscal 2023, offering full-time employees paid time off to serve their local communities through global service events such as Earth Day in the spring and \"Serv-a-palooza\" in the fall.

Our ERGs enhance our culture of belonging by creating a safe space for learning and dialogue for underrepresented groups, establishing a sense of community among associates and providing platforms to collect and share insights to support business imperatives. We currently have various ERGs for women, BIPOC, Veterans and LGBTQ+ communities. VF is committed to maximizing inclusion, diversity and equity not only within the Company, but within the communities where we live and work, while also being a positive influence within the apparel and footwear sector, and society at large. Culture and Engagement Our culture is built on our five Guiding Principles: Live with Integrity, Act with Empathy, Be Curious, Persevere, and Act Courageously. We have codified this culture through the lens of \u201cwhat we do\u201d, \u201cwhat we see\u201d and \u201chow we feel\u201d, and we measure our culture and Employee Net Promoter Score (\"eNPS\") via semiannual surveys. Results are evaluated, shared with associates and used to guide management focus and attention. Recent actions have included our Workplace Next initiative, which is focused on 1) driving flexibility for associates where they work, 2) creating engaging work environments that bring associates together to collaborate and innovate, and 3) equipping leaders to manage in a complex, hybrid environment. VF also conducts periodic pulse check surveys for interim feedback on specific topics such as ethics and compliance, safety, communications, and related topics. Talent Management  Talent Management includes the acquisition, development, skilling and upskilling, and deployment of our talent. We utilize a range of tools and programs including diverse candidate slates, talent reviews, performance coaching and development, succession planning, access to volunteering opportunities, IDEA training and hundreds of online learning modules that are available to all associates. Associate Wellbeing and Safety VF endeavors to support the diverse wellbeing needs of our associates and their families.
