The Company does not expect any individual new product to have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s revenues in 2023.   Source and Availability of Raw Materials  A significant majority of the Company\u2019s raw materials are agricultural commodities.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Company sources specific fruits, vegetables, and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors.  In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.\u00a0\u00a0The Company\u2019s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis.\u00a0\u00a0The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials.  Some of the principal crops that ADM sources and processes present specific climate change risks.  For example, South American soy and global palm present risks of deforestation due to their proximity to the forest and other high-carbon-value landscapes.  In addition, when not managed appropriately, row crops such as corn, soy, wheat, and canola present environmental risks such as water quality impairment, erosion, soil degradation, and GHG emissions.  However, these crops also present an opportunity to combat climate change through their ability to sequester carbon in the soil using regenerative agricultural practices.  In 2022, ADM launched its \u201cre: generations\u201d program to engage and encourage growers in its supply chain to implement regenerative agriculture practices.  In the first year of the program, the Company exceeded its goal to enroll one million acres.    7 7 7 Item 1.BUSINESS (Continued)    Item 1.BUSINESS (Continued)  Under the stewardship of ADM\u2019s Board of Directors, the Company has established several key social and environmental policies that collectively outline expectations for its employees, business partners and contractors, and the Company as a whole with respect to its sourcing operations.  These policies set the standards that govern the Company\u2019s approach to environmental stewardship, employee conduct, and raw material sourcing, among other areas, and outline ADM\u2019s positions on issues of widespread public interest.  These standards are included in, among others, the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct; Environment, Health, and Safety Policy; Human Rights Policy; Commitment to Protect Forests, Biodiversity, and Communities; Statement on Genetically Modified Organisms; Statement on Animal Testing; Commitment to Anti-Corruption Compliance; Protocol for Managing Supplier Non-Compliance and ADM Supplier Expectations, all of which are available on the Company\u2019s website (see Item 1, Business - Available Information).  In addition to policies, a portion of the Company\u2019s commodity sourcing is conducted using third-party certification programs including ADM Responsible Soy, Biomass Biofuel Sustainability Voluntary Scheme, Round Table for Responsible Soy, International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil, and U.S. Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol.  These programs have standards that are established to provide transparency on specific sustainability-related criteria.  ADM procures canola, soybeans, and palm under these programs.    Trademarks, Brands, Recipes, and other Intellectual Property  The Company owns trademarks, brands, recipes, and other intellectual property including patents, with a net book value of $809 million as of December 31, 2022.  The Company does not consider any segment of its business to be dependent upon any single or group of trademarks, brands, recipes, or other intellectual property.   Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers  Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services.\u00a0\u00a0There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company\u2019s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains.  The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world.\u00a0\u00a0Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest. \u00a0 The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company\u2019s working capital requirements.\u00a0\u00a0Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months.\u00a0\u00a0Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.  No material part of the Company\u2019s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.\u00a0\u00a0  Competition  The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company.\u00a0\u00a0Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company\u2019s asset portfolio.  The Company\u2019s Nutrition business is a vertically integrated business that provides ingredients and solutions for human, animal, and pet in a highly competitive environment with a variety of companies offering the same products and services.

Through the program, ADM works to sustain and strengthen its commitment to communities where ADM colleagues work, live, and operate by directing funding to initiatives and organizations driving meaningful social, economic, and environmental progress.  The ADM Cares team evaluates potential projects submitted for funding to ensure they meet eligibility criteria, such as initiatives that support education, food security and hunger relief, or safe, responsible, and environmentally sound agricultural practices in critical growing regions around the world.  In 2022, the Company directed $13\u00a0million to support Ukrainian colleagues and extend philanthropic support to those in need, including direct financial support, housing, and grants to non-profit organizations, such as the World Food Programme and Doctors Without Borders.   11 11 11 Item 1.BUSINESS (Continued)    Item 1.BUSINESS (Continued)  Scenario Analysis  In line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures, ADM conducted an analysis using three scenarios: 1.5\u00b0C (based on IPCC SSP1), 2\u00b0C (based on IEA WEO 450 Scenario), and 2.6\u00b0C (based on IEA INDC Scenario).  The first scenario assumes a rapid transition to a low carbon world in the next decade, limiting temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.  This involves a high degree of transformation across the economy.  Under this scenario, the worst anticipated physical impacts of climate change are avoided.  The second scenario involves ambitious actions to mitigate climate change, limiting temperature increase to 2\u00b0C.  This scenario requires greater policy action; however, there is still an increase in physical climate-related impacts.  The third scenario is based on the current status quo with no changes to policies or actions and an anticipated increase in global temperature by 2.6\u00b0C resulting in increased physical impacts of climate change.  ADM used these scenarios as written by the sources, except in the case of the third, status quo scenario, where transition risks were evaluated based on the Company\u2019s existing commitments:  Strive 35.  In each of the scenarios, the Company identified potential sourcing shifts and limitations, operational changes, physical impacts, and opportunities.  The primary risks identified fall into two categories:  physical and transition. Key opportunities are related to product and service offerings.  Physical Risks\u2022 Increased  severity  and frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes/cyclones and floods could  lead  to  increased  direct  costs from the disruption of supply chains and impair the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner.                                                                     \u2022 Increased  severity  and frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes/cyclones and floods could  lead  to  increased  sourcing  costs  due  to  limited availability of agricultural commodities and impact ADM\u2019s ability to produce goods, which would directly affect revenues.     Transition Risks\u2022 Emerging regulation and carbon pricing mechanisms could result in increased operational costs and/or tax liabilities in the short to medium term.\u2022 Market demand has a direct effect on production, as well as sustainable sourcing initiatives. Changes in consumer demands could result in additional cost of implementation that may not be overcome by product sales.\u2022 ADM uses coal-fired cogeneration technology to meet a sizeable portion of its energy demand.  The Company is working to reduce the carbon footprint of its operations and making capital investments in its facilities and new technologies.Products and Services Opportunities\u2022 Development and expansion of low-emission goods and services could lead to increased revenues resulting from increased demand.  As various renewable fuel standards are implemented around the world, ADM has an opportunity to capitalize on the increased demand through the production and sale of ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel.\u2022 As more businesses and consumers look to renewable products, development of new products or services could lead to increased revenues through access to new and emerging markets.

The Company reviewed the results of the scenario analysis with a cross-functional team of individuals from finance, strategy, sustainability, operations, legal, and risk management.  As part of the Company\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, the risks identified from the scenario analysis have been reviewed by the ERM team for mitigation actions.   Risk Management See Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for the discussion of climate-related risks.

ADM brings together colleagues with many different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.  These global teams drive innovative thinking, creating growth opportunities through diversity of thought.  The Company\u2019s comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) strategy includes four focus areas:  Leadership Engagement & Communication, Recruitment, Advancement & Retention, and Networks & Sponsorships.  In order to ensure that the Company\u2019s global DE&I strategy aligns with its business strategy, ADM formed a global DE&I council with strong presence in four regions of the world.  ADM is a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity, a coalition of CEO\u2019s committing to specific actions towards diversity and has made a commitment through Paradigm for Parity\u00ae to achieve gender parity in its senior leadership team by 2030.  Since making this commitment in 2018, the Company has improved its gender diversity from 21% to 28%.  ADM is proud of its achievements to date, and the Company will continue to strengthen diversity within middle management and entry-level hiring so the progress at the senior leadership level is sustainable over the long-term.  This is a key cultural strategic priority that will continue to strengthen the Company\u2019s ability to innovate and drive profitable growth.  At the industry level, ADM has been a key partner in the establishment of Together We Grow, a consortium of agricultural industry leaders united in a shared belief that American agriculture\u2019s best days are yet to come.  Emphasizing diversity and inclusion, Together We Grow works to build a modern workforce with the skills, experience, and capabilities needed to keep pace with the growing world.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has worked hard to recommend nominees who have skills and experiences relevant to ADM\u2019s strategy and operations and who reflect the diversity of the world around us.  As of December 31, 2022, 58% of ADM\u2019s 12 board members are diverse \u2013 six are African-American, Hispanic or Asian, and three are women.  Detailed information with respect to the Board\u2019s composition is set forth in \u201cProxy Summary \u2013 Director Nominee Diversity, Age, Tenure, and Independence\u201d of the definitive proxy statement for the Company\u2019s annual meeting of stockholders to be filed on or before May 1, 2023 and is incorporated herein by reference.  The Company believes diversity, equity, and inclusion are key business priorities that will enable ADM to continue innovating, driving growth through customer focus, and delivering outstanding performance for shareholders.  In 2021, ADM launched the first of its Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) focused on women as part of the Company\u2019s DE&I vision and strategy.  The ERGs, also known as Affinity Groups, are voluntary, employee-led groups where colleagues with shared experiences, interests or goals can come together in a safe space to provide support, build a sense of community, and promote personal and professional development.  Recognizing the broad spectrum of intersectionality, the Company expanded its ERGs in 2022 across its four regions (North America, APAC, EMEA, and LATAM) to include, depending on geographic relevance,  Multicultural, Black Colleague League, and LGBTQIA+ affinity groups.   ADM holds an annual Women\u2019s Leadership Summit \u2013 a two-day virtual event aimed at developing, inspiring, and empowering the Company\u2019s female leaders in each of the Company\u2019s four regions.  These events are designed to provide participants with tools to help navigate career development to advance more women into senior leadership roles.  The summit features motivational speakers and roundtable discussions with members of ADM\u2019s leadership, Executive Committee, members of the Board of Directors, and external coaches and trainers dedicated to addressing the leadership gender gap in corporate America.      14 14 14 Item 1.BUSINESS (Continued)    Item 1.BUSINESS (Continued)  Compensation and Benefits  ADM offers market-competitive pay, benefits, and services that help meet the needs of its employees.  The Company\u2019s global rewards package includes base pay, short-term incentive plans, long-term equity grants, paid time-off, employee assistance programs, and benefits that meet the country-specific competitive markets in which ADM operates.  ADM\u2019s global bonus plan has clearly defined enterprise metrics and objectives which are the same for all eligible employees \u2013 creating a strong team spirit and fostering collaboration among colleagues.

In addition, ADM offers many voluntary training opportunities that have largely moved to virtual and on-demand learning.      ADM prides itself in offering equitable career opportunities that include global assignments for its high potential talent, internal career growth for those who wish to learn more, and experiential learning through projects, mentorships, and on-the-job development.

For the last several years, the Company has been on a journey to a goal of zero injuries \u2013 building a safety culture so everyone will go home safely to their families and the things that are most important to them.   In 2022, about 76% of ADM\u2019s sites completed the year without recordable injuries and about 89% without lost workday injuries. The Company\u2019s Total Recordable Incident Rate of 0.73 and Lost Workday Incident Rate of 0.21 were unchanged in 2022.    ADM finished 2022 with two fatalities after a record 665 days with no fatalities.  In 2022, the Company had 12 serious injuries and is on track to reduce serious injuries by 50% in 2025 from a 2020 baseline.  The Company continues to take steps to further enhance the safety of its workplaces and maintains a goal of zero fatalities.  Through the guidance of the Environmental, Health, and Safety CoE, the operations teams focused on three programs to reduce the most serious injuries:  \u2013\u201cTake Control\u201d program, which identified over 65,000 machine access and guarding opportunities globally;  \u2013Near-miss Reporting and Investigation; and \u2013New Colleague Integration program.   Through continued application of these programs, ADM aims to achieve a 18% reduction in recordable injuries in 2023 compared to 2022.
