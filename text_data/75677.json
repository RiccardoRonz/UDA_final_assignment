Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations, and honeycomb protective packaging. In addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products. Our products are sustainable and are produced from renewable raw materials, predominately using energy derived from biogenic fuels in our production processes and are recyclable at end-of-life. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our Packaging segment produced 4.6 million tons of containerboard at our mills. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold 63.4 billion square feet (BSF) of corrugated products. The Packaging segment\u2019s net sales to third parties totaled $7.8 billion in 2022.  4 \u00a0  Facilities We manufacture containerboard, which includes a variety of performance and specialty grades, at our containerboard mills. Total annual containerboard capacity was approximately 5.0 million tons as of December 31, 2022. We also produce corrugated and protective packaging products at 89 manufacturing locations. The following provides more details of our primary operating facilities: Counce. Our Counce, Tennessee mill produces kraft linerboard on two machines. The mill can produce basis weights from 26 lb. to 90 lb.  DeRidder. Our DeRidder, Louisiana mill produces kraft linerboard on its No. 1 machine and kraft linerboard and corrugating medium on its No. 3 machine. The mill can produce linerboard in basis weights of 26 lb. to 69 lb. and medium in basis weights of 23 lb. to 33 lb.  Valdosta. Our Valdosta, Georgia mill produces kraft linerboard on one machine. The mill can produce basis weights from 35 lb. to 96 lb.  Tomahawk. Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill produces corrugating medium on two machines. The mill can produce basis weights from 23 lb. to 47 lb. Filer City. Our Filer City, Michigan mill produces corrugating medium on three machines. The mill can produce basis weights from 20 lb. to 47 lb. Wallula. Our Wallula, Washington mill produces corrugating medium on its No. 2 machine and kraft linerboard on its No. 3 machine. The mill can produce medium in basis weights from 23 lb. to 33 lb. and linerboard in basis weights from 31 lb. to 52 lb. Jackson. Our Jackson, Alabama mill produces kraft linerboard on its No. 3 machine and corrugating medium on its No. 1 machine. The mill can produce linerboard in basis weights from 22 lb. to 34 lb. and medium in basis weights from 23 lb. to 33 lb. Before October 2020, Jackson had historically operated as a UFS paper mill, with its results of operations reported in our Paper segment. Beginning in October 2020, operating results for the Jackson mill are included in both the Packaging and Paper segments. During the fourth quarter of 2020, in order to meet strong packaging demand and maintain appropriate inventory levels, we temporarily began producing linerboard on the No. 3 machine and, in the first quarter of 2021, we announced the discontinuation of producing uncoated freesheet paper grades on the machine and the permanent conversion of the machine to produce linerboard. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021, we began producing corrugating medium on the No. 1 machine. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 89 corrugated manufacturing and protective packaging operations, a technical and development center, 10 regional design centers, a rotogravure printing operation, and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers. Of the 89 manufacturing facilities, 58 are combining operations, commonly called corrugated plants, which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated packaging products, 30 are sheet plants, which procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated packaging products, and one is a corrugated sheet-only manufacturer. Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs. Each of our plants serves a market radius of approximately 150 miles. Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items. Major Raw Materials Used Fiber supply. Fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard. We consume both virgin wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills, and all of our fiber comes from renewable resources. Our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood, and recycled sources. All of our mills can utilize virgin wood fiber and all of our mills, other than the Valdosta mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production. Our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing process, which is consumed by our mills. In 2022, our usage of recycled fiber, net of internal generation, represents 17% of our containerboard production.  We procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights, long-term supply agreements, and market purchases and believe we have adequate sources of fiber supply for the foreseeable future.  5 \u00a0 As part of our renewable virgin fiber sourcing efforts, we participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative\u00ae (SFI), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), as well as the Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae (FSC\u00ae), and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards. These standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. We are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics. Energy supply. Energy at our packaging mills is obtained through self-generated or purchased fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include by-products of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process (including black liquor and wood waste), natural gas, purchased wood waste, and other purchased fuels. Each of our mills self-generates process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity. In 2022, our packaging mills consumed about 80 million MMBTUs of fuel to produce both steam and electricity. Of the 80 million MMBTUs consumed, about 63% was from mill-generated biogenic fuels that are by-products of our containerboard manufacturing and pulping process and 37% was from purchased fuels. Of the purchased fuels, 73% was from natural gas, 25% was from purchased wood waste and 2% was from other purchased fuels. Chemical supply. We consume various chemicals in the production of containerboard, including caustic soda, starch, sulfuric acid, soda ash, and lime. Most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts, which are bid or negotiated periodically. Sales, Marketing, and Distribution Our corrugated products are sold through our direct sales and marketing organization, independent brokers, and distribution partners. We have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence. Additionally, our design centers maintain an on-site dedicated graphics sales force. In addition to direct sales and marketing personnel, we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists. These individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers. General marketing support is provided at our corporate headquarters. Our containerboard sales group is responsible for linerboard and corrugating medium order processing and supply to our corrugated plants, to outside domestic customers, and to export customers. These personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers. Containerboard produced in our mills is primarily shipped by rail or truck. Our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service. Our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150-mile radius. We experienced higher freight costs in 2022 due to truck and driver shortages and limited boxcar availability, as well as fuel surcharges. Customers We sell containerboard and corrugated products to approximately 15,000 customers in approximately 31,000 locations. About 70% of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations. The remaining 30% of our corrugated products customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of PCA plants. No single customer exceeds 10% of segment sales. The primary end-use markets in the United States for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2021 Fibre Box Association annual report:  \u00a0 Food, beverages, and agricultural products \u00a0 \u00a0 48 % Retail and wholesale trade \u00a0 \u00a0 22 % Paper and other products \u00a0 \u00a0 10 % Chemical, plastic, and rubber products \u00a0 \u00a0 10 % Miscellaneous manufacturing \u00a0 \u00a0 10 % \u00a0 6 \u00a0 Competition As of December 31, 2022, we were the third largest producer of containerboard products in North America, according to industry sources and our own estimates. According to industry sources, corrugated products are produced by about 445 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,150 plants. The primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality, service, price, product design, and innovation. Most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer\u2019s specifications. Corrugated producers generally sell within a 150-mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region. Competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional, although we also face competition from competitors with significant national account presence. On a national level, our primary competitors are International Paper, WestRock Company, and Georgia-Pacific LLC. However, with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts, we also compete with many smaller, independent producers. Paper We are a leading producer of UFS in North America, according to industry sources and our own estimates. We manufacture and sell papers, including both commodity and specialty papers, which may have custom or specialized features such as colors, coatings, high brightness, and recycled content. Our papers consist of communication papers, including cut-size office papers, and printing and converting papers. Our products are sustainable and are produced from renewable raw materials, predominately using energy derived from biogenic fuels in our production processes and are recyclable at end-of-life. Facilities We currently have one paper mill located in International Falls, Minnesota that produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines. The mill has the capacity to produce approximately 500,000 tons annually.  Major Raw Materials Used Fiber supply. Fiber is the largest raw material cost in this segment. We consume wood fiber, recycled fiber, and purchased pulp. We purchase wood fiber through contracts and open-market purchase, and we purchase recycled fiber and pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual agreements.  As part of our renewable virgin fiber sourcing efforts, we participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative\u00ae (SFI), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), as well as the Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae (FSC\u00ae), and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards. These standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. We are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics. Energy supply. We obtain energy through self-generated or purchased fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include by-products of the manufacturing and pulping process (including black liquor and wood waste), natural gas, electricity, and purchased wood waste. The paper mill self-generates process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and to generate electricity. In 2022, our paper mill consumed about 11 million MMBTUs of fuel to produce both steam and electricity. Of the 11 million MMBTUs consumed, about 75% was from mill-generated biogenic fuels that are by-products of the manufacturing and pulping process and 25% was from purchased natural gas.  Chemical supply. We consume various chemicals in the production of white papers, including starch, precipitated calcium carbonate, caustic soda, and sodium chlorate. Most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts, which are bid or negotiated periodically. Sales, Marketing, and Distribution Our papers are sold primarily through our sales and marketing organization. We ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck. This allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements. 7 \u00a0 Customers We have about 40 customers in approximately 150 locations. These customers include office products distributors and retailers, paper merchants, and envelope and other converters. We have established long-term relationships with many of our customers. ODP Corporation (\"ODP\"), formerly Office Depot, Inc., along with its subsidiaries and affiliates, is our largest customer in the Paper segment. Effective January 1, 2023, we have a new agreement with ODP in which we will continue to supply commodity and non-commodity office papers through December 31, 2024. If the agreement is not renewed by the parties, ODP's obligation to purchase paper would phase down over a two-year period beginning January 1, 2025. In 2022, our sales revenue to ODP represented 48% of our Paper segment sales revenue and 4% of our consolidated sales revenue. Competition The markets in which our Paper segment competes are large and highly competitive. Commodity grades of UFS paper are globally traded, with numerous worldwide manufacturers, and as a result, these products compete primarily on the basis of price. Our paper manufacturing facility is located in the United States, and although we compete primarily in the domestic market, we do face competition from foreign producers. In 2016, as a result of a case brought by us and other domestic producers before United States international trade authorities, antidumping and countervailing duties at various levels were imposed on producers of uncoated freesheet papers produced in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, and Portugal. These duties remain in effect after sunset review of duty orders by the U.S. International Trade Commission in January 2022. Other factors influencing competition from overseas producers include domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates.  Our largest competitors include Domtar Corporation, a division of Paper Excellence, and Sylvamo Corporation. We also face competition from foreign producers and smaller North American producers. Although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades, quality and service are also important competitive determinants. Our papers compete with electronic data transmission, e-readers, electronic document storage alternatives, and paper grades we do not produce. Increasing shifts to these alternatives have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage and lower demand for communication papers. Corporate and Other Our Corporate and Other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities. This segment also includes transportation assets such as rail cars and trucks, which we use to transport some of our products to and from our manufacturing sites, and assets related to a 50% owned variable interest entity, Louisiana Timber Procurement Company, L.L.C. (LTP). Human Capital PCA\u2019s success depends on a highly engaged, results-oriented workforce operating in an entrepreneurial culture. Our primary objective is to place the right people in the right roles and empower them to succeed.  Safety is a core value at PCA and we believe that all accidents are preventable and an injury-free environment is achievable. We have implemented a robust occupational health and safety management system to assure accountability throughout the organization for safe work practices. Key components to our system include commitment from management, extensive training of employees, hazard identification and communication and regular safety audits.  During 2022, we were committed to conducting safe operations through the COVID-19 pandemic in accordance with the guidelines of the Center for Disease Control and applicable health and safety regulations. PCA has experienced some labor shortage issues due to labor market conditions in general which, earlier in the year, were exacerbated by the pandemic. However, PCA has not experienced significant disruptions in its operations and has managed to maintain adequate availability of its workforce and supply of raw materials and services to continue to serve its customers. 8 \u00a0 We have extensive recruiting, training and development programs designed to attract and retain a highly talented workforce aligned with our objectives to relentlessly serve our customers and achieve operational excellence throughout our organization. As demand for qualified personnel is increasing, we are expanding our efforts in these critical areas along with efforts to continue to develop, promote and maintain a diverse workforce with a culture and an environment of respect and inclusion. We believe it is essential to hire and promote diverse candidates and employees in order to bring the best ideas to serve our customers. We have established a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council consisting of leaders throughout our organization to hone our strategy and to create a roadmap for inclusive leadership. We publicly disclose in our annual responsibility report our employee demographics in the form of our annual EEO-1 report. Our responsibility report is available on our website and is not intended to be incorporated by reference herein. To promote employee engagement and improve the work experience of our employees, PCA regularly conducts employee engagement surveys. In 2022, PCA worked with a new external partner who specializes in developing, administering, and interpreting employee surveys. With their help, we transitioned our survey to an online format which made it more accessible to our employees. We also adopted updated methodologies and industry comparisons to measure employee engagement. According to the survey, PCA\u2019s overall employee engagement level is in line with other U.S. manufacturing companies. Our survey continued to have a high level of participation, assuring us that the survey results are an accurate reflection of the feelings and opinions of our employees. In their survey responses, our employees reaffirmed our strong safety culture, and that they feel the company is socially and environmentally responsible. For the first time, our survey introduced a question related to Diversity and Inclusion and our employees\u2019 perceptions on this topic were favorable. In addition, most employees acknowledged that they know what is expected from them and how their work contributes to PCA\u2019s success. Our next survey is scheduled for early 2024. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 15,100 employees, including 4,400 salaried and 10,700 hourly employees. Approximately 61% of our hourly employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. The majority of our unionized employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), the International Association of Machinists (IAM), and the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (AWPPW). During 2022, PCA reached new six-year master labor agreements covering seven mills and 25 container plants. We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future. During 2022, we experienced no work stoppages, and we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees.
