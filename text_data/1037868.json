Experienced Management Team.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another component of AMETEK\u2019s success is the strength of its management team and that team\u2019s commitment to improving Company performance. AMETEK senior management has extensive industry experience and an average of approximately 24\u00a0years of AMETEK service. The management team is focused on delivering strong, consistent and profitable growth, growing  2 2 2 Table of Contents Table of Contents shareholder value, and creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. Individual performance is tied to financial results through Company-established stock ownership guidelines and equity incentive programs. Business Strategy  AMETEK is committed to achieving earnings growth through the successful implementation of the AMETEK Growth Model. The goal of that model is double-digit annual percentage growth in sales and earnings per share over the business cycle and a superior return on total capital. Other financial initiatives have been or may be undertaken, including public and private debt or equity issuance, bank debt refinancing, local financing in certain foreign countries and share repurchases.  AMETEK\u2019s Growth Model integrates the four growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions, Global and Market Expansion, and New Product Development with a focus on cash generation and capital deployment.  Operational Excellence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operational Excellence is AMETEK\u2019s cornerstone strategy for accelerating growth, improving profit margins and strengthening its competitive position across its businesses. Operational Excellence focuses on initiatives to drive increased organic sales growth, improvements in operating   efficiencies and sustainable practices. It emphasizes team building and a participative management culture. AMETEK\u2019s Operational Excellence strategies include lean manufacturing, global sourcing, Design for Six Sigma, Value Engineering/Value Analysis, growth kaizens, and digitalization. Each plays an important role in improving efficiency, enhancing the pace and quality of innovation and driving profitable sales growth. Operational Excellence initiatives have yielded lower operating and administrative costs, shortened manufacturing cycle times, resulted in higher cash flow from operations and increased customer satisfaction. They also have played a key role in achieving synergies from newly acquired companies. Strategic Acquisitions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acquisitions are a key to achieving the goals of the AMETEK Growth Model. Since the beginning of 2018 through December\u00a031, 2022, AMETEK has completed 17\u00a0acquisitions with annualized sales totaling approximately $1.3\u00a0billion. AMETEK targets companies that offer a compelling strategic, technical and cultural fit. It seeks to acquire businesses in adjacent markets with complementary products and technologies. It also looks for businesses that provide attractive growth opportunities aligned with strong secular growth themes, often in new and emerging markets. Through these and prior acquisitions, AMETEK\u2019s management team has developed considerable skill in identifying, acquiring and integrating new businesses. As it has executed its acquisition strategy, AMETEK\u2019s mix of businesses has shifted toward those that are more highly differentiated and, therefore, offer better opportunities for growth and profitability. Global\u00a0& Market Expansion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AMETEK has historically experienced growth outside the United States, reflecting an expanding international customer base, investments in its global infrastructure and the attractive growth potential of its businesses in overseas markets. While Europe remains its largest overseas market, AMETEK has pursued growth opportunities worldwide, especially in key emerging markets. It has grown sales in Latin America and Asia by strategically building, acquiring and expanding manufacturing facilities. AMETEK also has expanded its sales, service, and engineering capabilities globally. Recently acquired businesses have further added to AMETEK\u2019s international presence.  New Product Development.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New products are essential to AMETEK\u2019s long-term growth. As a result, AMETEK has maintained a consistent investment in new product development and engineering. AMETEK's businesses help solve our customers' most complex challenges with differentiated technology solutions. In 2022, AMETEK added to its highly differentiated product portfolio with a range of new products across many of its businesses.  AMETEK focuses on cash generation and capital deployment.\u00a0\u00a0AMETEK generates strong cash flow given its asset-light business model and strong operational execution. This cash flow supports AMETEK\u2019s capital deployment strategy with its primary focus on strategic, value-enhancing acquisitions. AMETEK is also committed to paying a modest quarterly dividend. 3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents Attracting, retaining, and developing talent is critical to the success and sustainability of the AMETEK Growth Model as our employees are responsible for successfully driving these strategies. 2022 Overview Operating Performance In 2022, the Company posted record sales, operating income, operating margins, net income, diluted earnings per share, backlog, and orders.  The Company achieved these results from organic sales growth in both EIG and EMG, contributions from the 2022 acquisitions of Navitar, Inc. and RTDS Technologies, Inc., as well as the Company's Operational Excellence Initiatives. See \"Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details. In 2022, the Company achieved record sales of $6,150.5 million, an increase of 10.9% from 2021 due to an 11% organic sales increase, a 2% increase from acquisitions, partially offset by an unfavorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation. Diluted earnings per share for 2022 were a record $5.01, an increase of $0.76 or 17.8%, compared with $4.25 per diluted share in 2021. Recent Acquisitions AMETEK spent $429.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to purchase two businesses: In September 2022, AMETEK acquired Navitar, Inc. (\"Navitar\"), a designer and manufacturer of customized, fully integrated optical imaging systems, components, and software. In October 2022, AMETEK acquired RTDS Technologies (\"RTDS\"), a leading provider of real-time power simulation systems used by utilities, and research and education institutions in the development and testing of the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. Financing On May 12, 2022, the Company along with certain of its foreign subsidiaries amended and restated its credit agreement dated as of September 22, 2011, as amended and restated as of March 10, 2016 and as further amended and restated as of October 30, 2018, with the lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Bank of America, N.A., PNC Bank, National Association, Trust Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Co-Syndication Agents. The credit agreement amends and restates the Company\u2019s existing revolving credit facility to increase the size from $1.5\u00a0billion to $2.3\u00a0billion and terminates the $800\u00a0million term loan.  The credit agreement places certain restrictions on allowable additional indebtedness. Recent Events and Market Conditions Recent events and market conditions impacting our business include the inflationary cost environment, rising interest rates, supply chain constraints,  the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.  As a result of these events and conditions, we anticipate the challenging global economic environment to continue into 2023.  Beginning in 2021, we experienced heightened levels of inflation in material and transportation costs. We have taken steps to mitigate the impacts of material and transportation cost inflation by implementing pricing actions. We experienced additional pressure in our supply chain due to component shortages and strained transportation capacity, as well as the impact of continued elevated customer demand.  In response to these supply chain pressures, we have taken actions to build inventory and seek alternative sources of supply to support sales and backlog growth. The inflationary environment has also resulted in central banks raising short-term interest rates. We expect inflation to continue into 2023 and will continue to take actions to mitigate this inflationary pressure. 4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents There still remains uncertainty concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect on labor, government mandated lockdowns and other restrictive measures, and the pandemic's ultimate duration. Lockdowns in China during 2022 limited our ability to access customer sites, operate certain facilities, and placed additional constraints on our supply chain.  Depending on the course of the pandemic, additional lockdowns in China or elsewhere could impact our operations and results of operations.  The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the sanctions imposed in response to this conflict have increased global economic and political uncertainty. While we do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine and do not have significant exposure to customers and vendors in those countries, a significant expansion of the conflict's current scope could further complicate the economic environment.  While the ultimate impact of these events remains uncertain, we will continue to evaluate the extent to which these factors will impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
