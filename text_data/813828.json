Miramax.\u00a0\u00a0Miramax, a joint venture with beIN Media Group, is a global film and television studio with an extensive library of content. We have exclusive, long-term rights to distribute Miramax\u2019s library, as well as certain rights to co-produce, co-finance and/or distribute new film and television projects. Filmed Entertainment produces most of the films we release and also acquires films for distribution from third parties. In some cases, we co-finance and/or co-distribute films with third parties, including other studios. We also enter into film-specific and multipicture financing arrangements from time to time under which third parties participate in the financing of the costs of a film or group of films in exchange for an economic participation and a partial copyright interest.  We distribute films in various media worldwide or in select territories and may engage third-party distributors for certain films in certain territories. Domestically, we generally market and distribute our own theatrical and home entertainment releases. Internationally, we distribute theatrical releases through our international affiliates or, in territories where we have no operating presence, through United International Pictures, our joint venture with Universal Studios, or other third-party distributors. For home entertainment releases, DVD and Blu-ray discs are distributed internationally by local licensees. We also license films and television shows domestically and/or internationally to a variety of platforms. Competition We operate in highly competitive environments and compete for creative talent and intellectual property, as well as for audiences and distribution of our content. We compete with a variety of media, technology and entertainment companies with substantial resources to produce, acquire and distribute content around the world, including broadcast and cable networks, streaming services, film and television studios, production groups, independent producers and syndicators, television stations and television station groups. We compete with other content creators for creative talent, including producers, directors, actors and writers, as well as for new content ideas and intellectual property and for the acquisition of popular programming. We compete for audiences for our content with releases from other film studios, television producers and streaming services, as well as with other forms of entertainment and consumer spending outlets. We compete for audiences and advertising revenues primarily with other television networks; streaming services; social media; websites, apps and other online experiences; radio programming; and print media. Our businesses also face competition from the many other entertainment options available to consumers, including video games, sports, travel and outdoor recreation. We face competition for distribution of our content. Our TV Media businesses compete for distribution of our program services (and receipt of related fees) with other television networks and programmers. We also compete with other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations to ensure the effective distribution of network programming in the U.S. We also compete with studios and other producers of entertainment content for distribution on third-party platforms.

We organize our ESG work into three focus areas: (1) On-Screen Content & Social Impact, (2) Workforce & Culture and (3) Sustainable Production & Operations. On-Screen Content & Social Impact encompasses the opportunities and responsibilities we have to represent, inform and influence through our content and brands. Workforce & Culture includes our efforts to recruit and retain the best employees; treat employees, contractors and partners well; and foster an environment where everyone feels welcome and safe. Sustainable Production & Operations aims to address the environmental and social impacts of our operations and facilities. In 2022, we released our third ESG Report, which is available on our website and includes an update on the progress we have made in each focus area. ESG Governance Our ESG team oversees the day-to-day strategy and implementation of our ESG efforts under the leadership of a steering committee, comprised of senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. We also have multiple working groups dedicated to specific ESG topics made up of subject matter experts from across our brands and functional teams, which together with the steering committee constitute our ESG Council. Our ESG Council actively reviews and refines our ESG strategies and the ESG team regularly updates senior management, our Board of Directors and its Nominating and Governance Committee, which, pursuant to its charter, oversees and monitors significant issues impacting our culture and reputation, as well as our handling of ESG matters. Human Capital Management We work to create a culture that is welcoming and nurturing to all, and a workplace where our employees and talent feel supported, heard and understood, and have the opportunity to thrive. Our human capital management strategy is intended to address the areas described below, and additional information can be found in our ESG Report. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 24,500 full- and part-time employees in 37 countries worldwide and had approximately 5,800 project-based staff on our payroll. We also use temporary employees in the ordinary course of business. A Culture of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion We continue to cultivate a culture that reflects to our core values and is rooted in our dynamic and proactive approach to DEI through a range of partnerships, collaborations, programs and initiatives. \u2022Senior leaders from across the Company serve on a cross-functional council focused on inclusion, and many of our brands and functional teams maintain internal inclusivity councils to address DEI activities and challenges, including workforce pipeline development, external DEI-focused partnerships, and sponsorship and mentoring initiatives targeting underrepresented groups. \u2022We partner with diversity-focused institutions and professional associations both domestically and internationally that are committed to supporting, and post positions to diversity-centric job boards with organizations that support, women, BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals, military personnel and veterans and/or persons with disabilities to help attract, engage and retain diverse talent at all levels. \u2022We introduced a dedicated talent sourcing team focused on building diverse talent pipelines. We sponsor internal and external professional development programs and campus-to-career initiatives aimed at underrepresented groups.

Preventing Harassment and Discrimination We remain committed to building a work environment free of harassment and discrimination and have taken significant actions as part of this commitment. \u2022Our Global Business Conduct Statement guides our approach to preventing harassment, discrimination, and any other behavior that creates a hostile workplace. It provides employees with clear examples of harassment and discrimination and guidance on how to create a safe and inclusive environment for all employees. We make annual trainings on sexual harassment, discrimination, and retaliation prevention available to all employees, as well as unconscious bias training and inclusive recruitment training for hiring managers. \u2022We require that employees report any incidents of harassment and discrimination and provide multiple reporting options, including an anonymous third-party-managed complaint and reporting hotline. \u2022Our centralized Employee Relations team oversees all investigations of complaints of discrimination, harassment and retaliation in all areas of the organization, including our own productions. \u2022We monitor employee diversity data trends by gender, ethnicity, and level, as well as self-reported metrics such as sexual orientation and disability inclusion, including to track the promotion rates of women and ethnically diverse employees and identify and address any patterns that might suggest discrimination or unconscious bias. Employee Attraction, Retention and Training We strive to create a high-performance culture, including investing in building outstanding managers and teams, strengthening employee development, and helping every team member live up to that team member\u2019s full potential. Our training, mentoring and career mobility programs embody our culture of DEI as we recruit, retain and engage our employees. \u2022We offer a diverse and flexible range of learning opportunities for our employees, including expanded skill-building offerings, weekly courses for managers, multi-month leadership cohort experiences and customized team workshops. \u2022We provide tuition support programs for employees pursuing education and encourage employees to learn, develop and collaborate through mentoring programs. \u2022We offer comprehensive compensation and benefits, including health, life and disability insurance; matching retirement contributions; flexible paid time off; paid volunteer time; financial planning assistance; multiple wellness programs; bicycle commuter reimbursement; and parental, caregiving, bereavement and military leave benefits. In addition, we support families with a range of resources, including enhanced fertility, adoption and surrogacy benefits, along with childcare and eldercare resources, and flexible work hours. \u2022In 2022, we launched our second global employee engagement survey to assess our efforts around employee engagement, inclusion and well-being. Senior leaders reviewed the survey results and instituted action plans to address feedback and opportunity areas.

We strive to take a proactive and targeted approach to identifying and mitigating health, safety and security risks. \u2022Our cross-functional return-to-office task force created and executed a hybrid work plan focused on collaboration and flexibility. We also established new health offerings for certain locations to facilitate the transition, including the return of our Wellness Studio, offering exercise and training options.  \u2022Production team members are required to attend daily safety meetings that serve as an overview of potential on-set safety hazards that day. We also require job- and event-specific safety training for employees where relevant. \u2022We strive to track and report safety, health and security incident data across the Company, implementing process changes and training as relevant. \u2022Our global security command center oversees security and emergency response efforts and undertakes risk scans to identify potential safety threats. \u2022We offer confidential mental health resources to support our employees and their families year-round and accessible mental health care and meditation programs to facilitate employee self-care.  Social Impact and Corporate Social Responsibility We use our content and platforms to represent, explore and champion issues that align with our values and impact our viewers, including by exploring and raising awareness of issues such as social justice, climate change, mental health, and civic engagement. We drive our social impact through our content and with our partners in communities globally. Our commitment to social impact is not only exemplified by the content we produce, but also our community service projects, philanthropy and employee engagement efforts. Content for Change Content for Change, first launched by BET and then rolled out across the Company, is an initiative to use the power of storytelling to transform how we see ourselves and one another, and to counteract bias, stereotypes and hate in our society. The initiative is grounded in data-driven research in partnership with the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and centered across three pillars \u2014 the content we produce, the creative supply chain that powers it and our culture.  SpongeBob SquarePants: Operation Sea Change In 2022, we launched SpongeBob SquarePants: Operation Sea Change, a multi-year global ocean conservation and sustainability initiative. Through partnerships with several non-profit organizations, Operation Sea Change aims to help remove and divert ocean plastic by funding global clean-up work, promoting sustainable products, and educating fans on how they can help protect the ocean. Regulation Our businesses and the intellectual property they create or acquire are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as laws and regulations of countries other than the U.S. and pan-national bodies such as the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d). The laws and regulations affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change, as are the protections that those laws and regulations afford us. The discussion below describes certain, but not all, laws and regulations affecting our businesses.

Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, the imposition of reporting obligations, limited renewals of broadcast station licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. License Renewals and Transfers Each of our owned television stations in the U.S. must be licensed by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are typically granted for eight-year terms, and we must obtain renewals as they expire to continue operating our stations. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that (1) the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (2) with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or FCC regulations; and (3) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. A station remains authorized to operate while its license renewal application is pending. In addition, the Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee. Broadcast Ownership Regulation The Communications Act and FCC rules impose limits on local and national broadcast television station ownership in the U.S. The broadcast ownership rules discussed below are the most relevant to our U.S. operations. Local Television Ownership The FCC\u2019s local television ownership rule generally prohibits common ownership of two full-power stations in a market unless at least one of the stations is not a top-four ranked station in the market based on audience share at the time of acquisition of the second station. However, the FCC may permit such common ownership if it finds such ownership would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. Dual Network Rule The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major U.S. broadcast networks \u2014 ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC \u2014 from combining or being under common control. Television National Audience Reach Limitation Under the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations that reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. For purposes of this rule, a UHF station is afforded a \u201cdiscount\u201d and is therefore attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market. We currently own and operate television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households, but we are attributed with reaching approximately 24% of all such households for purposes of the national ownership rule because of the discount. Foreign Ownership The Communications Act generally restricts foreign individuals or entities from collectively owning more than 25% of our voting power or equity. FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold. The FCC has approved foreign ownership levels of up to 100% in certain instances, following its review and approval of specific, named foreign individuals.

The Communications Act and FCC regulations require that broadcasters and some categories of MVPDs negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent. Some MVPDs have sought changes to federal law that would eliminate or otherwise limit the ability of broadcasters to obtain fair compensation for the grant of retransmission consent. Program Regulation The FCC also regulates the content of broadcast, cable network, and other video programming. The FCC prohibits broadcasters from airing obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. The FCC\u2019s maximum forfeiture penalty per station for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is $479,945 per indecent or profane utterance or image, with a maximum forfeiture exposure of approximately $4.3 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The FCC also monitors compliance with requirements that apply to broadcasters and cable networks relating to political advertising, identification of program sponsors, and the use and integrity of the Emergency Alert System. In addition, FCC regulations require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming, as well as certain programming in the U.S. delivered by internet protocol. Broadcast television stations in certain markets that are affiliated with one of the four major U.S. broadcast networks must also provide a certain amount of programming every quarter that includes audio-narrated description of a program\u2019s key visual elements that make the program accessible to blind and low-vision viewers. Children\u2019s Programming Our business is subject to various regulations in the U.S. and abroad applicable to children\u2019s programming. U.S. federal law and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast television stations and cable networks during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and the FCC also limits the display of certain commercial website addresses during children\u2019s programming. Moreover, each of our broadcast television stations in the U.S. is required to air, in general, three hours per week of programming specifically designed to meet the educational and informational programming needs of children 16 years of age and younger. In addition, some policymakers have sought limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. For example, restrictions on the television advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (\u201cHFSS\u201d) to children aged 15 and under have been in place in the U.K. since 2007. The U.K. government has announced its intention to impose a ban, effective in October 2025, on all HFSS advertising before 9:00 p.m. on television and a total ban online. Various laws with similar objectives have also been enacted in a number of jurisdictions, and pressure for their introduction elsewhere continues to be felt globally.  Broadcast Transmission Standard FCC rules permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the \u201cNext Generation\u201d broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also called \u201cATSC 3.0.\u201d Full-service television stations using the standard are subject to certain requirements, including the obligation to continue broadcasting a generally identical program stream in the current ATSC 1.0 broadcast standard. The ATSC 3.0 standard can be used to offer better picture quality and improved mobile broadcast viewing. A television station converting to ATSC 3.0 operation will incur significant costs in equipment purchases and upgrades. In addition, consumers may be required to obtain new television sets or other equipment that are capable of receiving ATSC 3.0 broadcasts. We are participating in ATSC 3.0 partnerships with other broadcasters and may enter into additional partnerships in the future.
