We strive to cultivate a better world by serving responsibly sourced, classically cooked, real food with wholesome ingredients and without artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. We are passionate about providing a great guest experience and making our food more accessible to everyone while continuing to be a brand with a demonstrated purpose. Our first Chipotle restaurant opened in Denver, Colorado in 1993. Nearly 30 years later, our devotion to seeking out high-quality ingredients, raised with respect for animals, farmers, and the environment, remains at the core of our commitment to Food With Integrity.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we owned and operated 3,129 Chipotle restaurants throughout the United States, 53 international Chipotle restaurants, and five non-Chipotle restaurants. We manage our operations based on eight regions and have aggregated our operations to one reportable segment. Our revenue is derived from sales by our restaurants. \u00a03Table of Contents\u00a0 \u00a03 \u00a0 3 Table of Contents\u00a0 Table of Contents \u00a0  Business StrategyWe are a brand with a demonstrated purpose of Cultivating a Better World.\u00a0Our mission is to win today while creating a bright future by focusing on five key fundamental strategies: \uf0b7Running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great Food With Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; \uf0b7Sustaining world class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level;\uf0b7Amplifying technology and innovation to drive digital growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers;\uf0b7Making the brand visible, relevant, and loved to improve overall guest engagement;\uf0b7And expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings.Food With IntegrityServing high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to ensuring guests enjoy wholesome food at a great value. In our Chipotle restaurants, we strive to serve only meats that are raised in accordance with criteria we have established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare, and without the use of non-therapeutic antibiotics or added growth hormones. We brand these meats as \u201cResponsibly Raised\u00ae.\u201d We also seek to use responsibly grown produce, by which we mean produce grown by suppliers whose practices conform to our Food With Integrity standards and our priorities with respect to environmental considerations and employee welfare. For more information about our sustainability and animal welfare initiatives, see our biennial Sustainability Report and interim Update Report on our website www.chipotle.com/about-us/sustainability. PurchasingMaintaining the high levels of quality and safety we demand in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire high-quality, fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. Our 26 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality, price, availability, and the suppliers\u2019 understanding of and adherence to our mission and Food With Integrity standards.\u00a0We\u2019ve also sought to increase, where practical, the number of suppliers for our ingredients to help mitigate pricing volatility and reduce our reliance on one or several suppliers, which could create supply shortages. In addition, we closely monitor industry news, trade tariffs, weather, exchange rates, foreign demand, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. Certain key ingredients (certain cuts of beef, tomatoes, tortillas and adobo) are purchased from a small number of suppliers. Quality Assurance and Food SafetyWe are committed to serving\u00a0only safe, high quality food.\u00a0Our food safety and quality assurance teams work to ensure compliance with our food safety programs and practices, components of which include:\uf0b7natural inhibitors (to prevent microbial growth in ingredients);\uf0b7advanced technologies (tools that reduce or eliminate pathogens while maintaining food quality);\uf0b7small grower support;\uf0b7enhanced restaurant procedures (protocols for handling ingredients and sanitizing surfaces in our restaurants);\uf0b7food safety certifications; \uf0b7internal and third-party restaurant inspections; \uf0b7supplier interventions (steps to mitigate food safety risks before ingredients reach Chipotle); and\uf0b7ingredient traceability.These and other food safety practices underscore our commitment to be a leader in food safety while continuing to serve high quality food that our guests love. Our food safety and quality assurance teams establish and monitor our quality and food safety programs and work closely with suppliers to ensure our high standards are met throughout the supply chain. We maintain a limited list of approved suppliers, many of whom are among the top suppliers in the industry. In addition, we have a team approach where our\u00a0training, operations, culinary, legal and restaurant food safety and quality assurance departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality, food preparation, restaurant cleanliness, employee health protocols, and safety in the restaurants. Our food safety programs are also intended to ensure that we not only continue to comply with applicable federal, state and local food safety regulations, but also establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. To help achieve this goal, we have a Food Safety Advisory Council comprised of some of the nation\u2019s foremost food safety authorities. The Food Safety Advisory Council is charged with evaluating our programs and advising us on ways to elevate our already high standards for food safety. Our food safety and quality assurance team members hold board seats and participate in technical working groups with several associations. This gives us the opportunity to learn and share our knowledge and expertise with other food safety professionals and regulatory agencies.

In recent years we have significantly upgraded our capabilities by digitizing our restaurant kitchens, expanding our partnerships with third-party delivery services and building more Chipotlanes, which is our drive through format for customer pick-up of digital orders. Digital sales, which represent food and beverage revenue generated through the Chipotle website, Chipotle app or third-party delivery aggregators includes revenue deferrals associated with Chipotle Rewards, represented 39.4% of food and beverage revenue in 2022, compared to 45.0% of food and beverage revenue in 2021. Our strong digital platform gave us a competitive advantage during the peaks of the COVID-19 pandemic, as more guests preferred to eat their meals at home and in-restaurant dining was prohibited or restricted. We have made digital ordering convenient with enhancements to the Chipotle app and website, such as unlimited customization, contactless delivery, and group ordering. Human CapitalAs of December\u00a031, 2022, Chipotle employed 104,958 people worldwide, of which 103,345 individuals are employed in the U.S. and 1,613 are employed in Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. In the United States, we employed 102,219 people in our restaurants and 1,126 people in our Restaurant Support Centers and field support organizations. In 2022 only one restaurant voted to form a union, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good. We also believe our efforts to manage our workforce have been effective, as evidenced by a strong culture and our employees\u2019 demonstrated commitment to living our purpose and values.Diversity, Equity & InclusionAs a people-first company rooted in values, our purpose of Cultivating a Better World extends beyond serving nutritious food using real ingredients. It means hiring world-class individuals dedicated to investing in their future and partnering together to positively impact the communities they serve. Most notably, our diversity and inclusion strategy is to foster a culture that values and champions diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business and Cultivate a Better World.As of December\u00a031, 2022, approximately 50% of our U.S.-based employee population was female and approximately 70% of our U.S.-based employee population was comprised of racial and ethnic minorities. U.S. diversity statistics were as follows:Our most recent EEO-1 consolidated report is posted on the Investors page of our website at www.ir.chipotle.com under Corporate Governance \u2013 Human Capital Information and additional details about the demographics of our employee population is included there and in our biennial Sustainability Report and interim Update Report on our website www.chipotle.com/about-us/sustainability. Maintaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment is critical to our business success. Therefore, we have undertaken several actions to ensure that our diversity strategy is effective. Since December 2021, we have been participating in Management Leadership for Tomorrow\u2019s Black Equity at Work Certification Program, which establishes a comprehensive aggregate measurement system and provides a rigorous, results-oriented approach that accelerates progress toward Black equity internally, amongst our employees, and externally by supporting Black equity within our business partners and in the communities where we operate. In addition to the Black Equity at Work Certification Program, in early 2023 we engaged an independent third-party consultant to conduct a Talent Management Equity Audit, which aims to identify where in the talent management cycle we may need to debias or create more equitable policies, practices, and procedures, identify potential blockers and new opportunities to creating and sustaining equity in talent management, and identify key strengths and pockets of risk. We plan to disclose key results and action plans from these initiatives in our Sustainability Report.    Digital Business  Our digital platform continues to be a strategic driver of our growth.

In 2022, our review included 99% of our U.S. employee population, excluding only approximately 50 of our most senior management employees, and the results did not identify preferential treatment to any class of employee; however, we identified several isolated discrepancies between actual compensation and our policies and we quickly made pay adjustments to close all identified gaps.   Talent DevelopmentWe believe that our people and culture give us a competitive advantage in our business. In 2022, we had approximately 22,000 internal promotions.

Although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property, we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business.  \u00a07Table of Contents\u00a0 \u00a07 \u00a0 7 Table of Contents\u00a0 Table of Contents \u00a0  Available Information We maintain a website at www.chipotle.com, including an investor relations section at ir.chipotle.com, on which we routinely post important information, such as webcasts of quarterly earnings calls and other investor events in which we participate or host, and any related materials.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the risks and uncertainties described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including, but not limited to, overall economic and industry conditions. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may arise or become material and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock.Risks Related to the Nature of our Business and the Restaurant IndustryFood safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business by decreasing sales and increasing costs.Food safety is our top priority, and we dedicate significant resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe, high-quality food products. However, even with strong preventative controls and interventions, food safety risks cannot be completely eliminated in every restaurant. Incidents of food-borne illnesses continue to occur in the restaurant industry and may result from the failure of restaurant employees or suppliers to follow our food safety policies and procedures, or from employees or guests entering our restaurant while ill and contaminating ingredients or surfaces. Although we monitor and audit compliance with our program, we cannot guarantee that each and every food item is safely and properly maintained from the start of the supply chain through guest consumption. Any report, legitimate or rumored, of food-borne illness such as E. coli, hepatitis A, norovirus or salmonella, or other food safety issue, such as food tampering or contamination, at one of our restaurants could adversely affect our reputation and have a negative impact on our sales. In addition, instances of food-borne illness or food safety issues that occur solely at competitors\u2019 restaurants could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry and adversely impact our sales. Social media has dramatically increased the speed with which negative publicity, including actual or perceived food safety incidents, is disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to investigate, respond to and address an issue. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.We may be more susceptible than our competitors to significant negative consequences from food safety incidents due to several highly publicized food safety incidents involving E. coli, C. perfringens bacteria and norovirus that were connected to a number of our restaurants between 2015 to 2018. These incidents and the related negative publicity had a significant negative impact on our sales and profitability for those years. Because of consumer perceptions of our restaurants in the wake of these incidents, any future food safety incidents associated with our restaurants\u2014even incidents that would be considered minor at our competitors\u2014may have a more significant negative impact on our sales and our ability to retain guests. In addition, we may be at a higher risk for food safety incidents than some competitors due to our greater use of fresh, unprocessed produce, handling of raw chicken in our restaurants, our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation, and our avoidance of frozen ingredients. The risk of illnesses associated with our food also may increase due to our delivery or catering businesses, in which our food is transported, stored and/or served in conditions that are not under our control. All of these factors could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain guests, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability.Our digital business, which accounted for a significant portion of our 2022 total revenue, is subject to risks.In 2022, 39.4% of our food and beverage revenue was derived from digital orders, which includes third-party delivery and customer pickup in-restaurant and through our Chipotlanes. Approximately 19% of our 2022 food and beverage revenue consisted of delivery orders for which we are reliant on third-party delivery companies. Depending on which ordering platform a guest uses \u2013 our platform or the platform of a third-party delivery service \u2013 the delivery fee we collect from the guest may be less than the actual delivery cost, which has a negative impact on our profitability. In 2022, we implemented several menu price increases to partially offset the increases in delivery, labor and other costs; however, our higher menu prices may cause some guests to shift their purchases to other restaurants offered on the platform. These delivery companies maintain control over data regarding our guests who use their platform and over the guest experience. If a third-party delivery driver fails to make timely deliveries or fails to deliver the complete order, our guests may attribute the bad customer experience to Chipotle and could stop ordering from us. The ordering and payment platforms used by these third parties, our mobile app or our online ordering site has been and could again be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our overall sales and reputation. If the third-party delivery companies we utilize increase their fees or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to other restaurants, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted. The delivery business has been consolidating and may continue to consolidate, which may give third-party delivery companies more leverage in negotiating the terms and pricing of contracts, which in turn could negatively impact our profits from this channel.
