{"cik": 859737, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01. Business Overview We are a developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products, medical imaging systems, and surgical products focused on women's health and well-being through early detection and treatment. We sell and service our products through a combination of direct sales and service personnel and a network of independent distributors and sales representatives. We operate in four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health.   Through our Diagnostics segment, we offer a wide range of diagnostic products, which are used primarily to aid in the screening and diagnosis of human diseases. Our primary Diagnostics products include our molecular diagnostic assays, which run on our advanced instrumentation systems (Panther, Panther Fusion and Tigris), our ThinPrep cytology system, and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test. Our Aptima family of molecular diagnostic assays is used to detect, among other things, the infectious microorganisms that cause common sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, or CT/NG; certain high-risk strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV; Trichomonas vaginalis, the parasite that causes trichomoniasis; Mycoplasma genitalium; and Herpes Simplex viruses 1 and 2. We also offer viral load tests for the quantitation of Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV-1, and human cytomegalo virus, or CMV, for use on our Panther instrument system. In addition, we offer bacterial vaginosis and candida vaginitis assays for the diagnosis of vaginitis, a common and complex ailment affecting millions of women a year. Our assay portfolio also includes diagnostic tests for a range of acute respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2, various strains of influenza and parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as a test for the detection of Group B Streptococcus, or GBS, that are run on the Panther Fusion system, a field upgradeable instrument addition to the base Panther system. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and launched the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay and the Aptima SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay (each of which runs on our standard Panther system) and the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (which runs on our Panther Fusion system). In May 2022, we CE-marked two new molecular assays, Panther Fusion EBV Quant assay for quantitation of Epstein-Barr virus, and the Panther Fusion BKV Quant assay for quantitation of the BK virus. These two new assays are the first quantitative real-time PCR assays on the Panther Fusion system. These assays, along with the Aptima CMV Quant assay already available in Europe, expand our menu of transplant monitoring assays. The ThinPrep System is primarily used in cytology applications, such as cervical cancer screening, and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth. We also generate service revenues from our CLIA-certified laboratory for testing related to breast cancer and all metastatic cancers.   Our Breast Health segment offers a broad portfolio of solutions for breast cancer care primarily in the areas of radiology, breast surgery, pathology and treatment. These solutions include 3D digital mammography systems, image analytics software utilizing artificial intelligence, reading workstations, minimally invasive breast biopsy guidance systems, breast biopsy site markers, localization, specimen radiology, connectivity solutions and breast conserving surgery products. Our most advanced breast imaging platforms, Selenia 3D Dimensions and 3Dimensions systems, utilize tomosynthesis to produce 3D images that show multiple contiguous slice images of the breast, which we refer to as the Genius 3D Mammography exam.   Our GYN Surgical products include our MyoSure hysteroscopic tissue removal system, or MyoSure, our NovaSure endometrial ablation system, or NovaSure, our Fluent fluid management system, or Fluent, our Acessa ProVu laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation system, or Acessa ProVu, as well as our CoolSeal vessel sealing portfolio and our JustRight surgical stapler. The MyoSure suite of devices offers four options to provide incision-less removal of fibroids, polyps, and other pathology within the uterus. The NovaSure portfolio is comprised of the NovaSure CLASSIC device, NovaSure ADVANCED device and the NovaSure V5 device for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. The Fluent system is a fluid management system that provides liquid distention during diagnostic and operative hysteroscopic procedures. The Acessa ProVu system is a fully integrated system that uses laparoscopic ultrasound, guidance mapping and radiofrequency ablation to treat nearly all types of fibroids. The CoolSeal portfolio includes the Trinity, Reveal, and Mini advanced bipolar vessel sealing devices. The JustRight 5 mm stapler features a smaller instrument profile and is used for laparoscopic general and pediatric surgery. Our Skeletal Health segment's products include the Horizon DXA, a dual energy x-ray system, which evaluates bone density and performs body composition assessments, and the Fluoroscan Insight FD mini C-arm, which assists in performing minimally invasive orthopedic surgical procedures on a patient's extremities, such as the hand, wrist, knee, foot, and ankle.

Products \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We view our operations and manage our current business in four principal reporting segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health. Financial information concerning these segments is provided in Note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report. The following describes our principal products in each of our segments. Diagnostics Product Offerings Molecular Diagnostic Instrumentation We have developed and continue to develop instrumentation and software designed specifically for use with certain of our molecular diagnostic assays. We also provide technical support and service to maintain these instrument systems in the field. By placing our proprietary instrumentation in laboratories and hospitals, we can establish a platform for future sales of our assays. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our instrumentation includes the Tigris system, an integrated, fully automated testing instrument for high-volume laboratories which is approved for use with certain of our Aptima assays; and the Panther instrument system, an integrated, fully automated testing instrument capable of serving high-, medium- and low-volume laboratories. Our Panther Fusion system, including the related Fusion assays for flu, respiratory and transplant testing, extends the capabilities of our Panther system by adding the flexibility of polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, functionality to our existing Transcription Mediated Amplification, or TMA, based technology. The Panther Fusion system is available as a modular in-lab upgrade to our base Panther system. In addition, our instrumentation also includes the Tomcat instrument, a fully automated general-purpose instrument designed to improve pre-analytical sample processing by eliminating the inefficient and error-prone activities associated with manually transferring samples from one tube to another.  Molecular Diagnostic Assay Portfolio  We have a broad menu of assays available for sale in our primary markets that can be performed on the base Panther System or on the combined Panther Fusion System as indicated in the table below. Our Aptima family of molecular diagnostic assays integrate a number of proprietary core technologies, including our target capture technology, our TMA technology, and our hybridization protection assay, or HPA, and dual kinetic assay, or DKA, technologies, to produce highly sensitive amplification assays. Each of these technologies is described in greater detail below under the heading \u201cProprietary Core Technologies\u201d. Our Panther Fusion family of molecular diagnostic assays are performed on the Panther Fusion System and utilize PCR technology to amplify target nucleic acid sequences for easier detection.  6 6 6  Table of Contents Table of Contents   Unless otherwise noted the assays shown in the table below have been approved or cleared for sale in the U.S. and are available for sale in countries recognizing the CE-mark.

Proprietary Core Technologies  Target Capture/Nucleic Acid Extraction Technology. The detection of target organisms that are present in small numbers in a large-volume clinical sample requires that target organisms be concentrated to a detectable level. One way to accomplish this is to isolate the particular nucleic acid of interest by binding it to a solid support. This support, with the target bound to it, can then be separated from the original sample. We refer to such techniques as \u201ctarget capture.\u201d We have developed target capture techniques to immobilize nucleic acids on magnetic beads by using a \u201ccapture probe\u201d that binds to the bead and to the target nucleic acid. We use magnetic separation to concentrate the target by drawing the magnetic beads to the sides of a sample tube, while the remainder of the sample is removed from the tube. When used in conjunction with our amplification procedures, target capture techniques concentrate the nucleic acid target(s) and also remove materials in the sample that might otherwise interfere with amplification.  Transcription-Mediated Amplification (TMA) Technology. The goal of amplification technologies is to increase the copy number of a target nucleic acid sequences that may be present in samples in small numbers. These copies can then be detected using nucleic acid probes. Amplification technologies can yield results in only a few hours versus the several days or weeks required for traditional culture methods. TMA is a transcription-based amplification system that uses two different enzymes to drive the process. The first enzyme is a reverse transcriptase that creates a double-stranded DNA copy from an RNA or DNA template. The second enzyme, an RNA polymerase, makes thousands of copies of the complementary RNA sequence, known as the \u201cRNA amplicon,\u201d from the double-stranded DNA template. Each RNA amplicon serves as a new target for the reverse transcriptase and the process repeats automatically, resulting in an exponential amplification of the original target that can produce over a billion copies of the RNA amplicon in less than thirty minutes.  Hybridization Protection Assay (HPA) and Dual Kinetic Assay (DKA) Technologies. With our HPA technology, we have simplified testing, further increased test sensitivity and specificity, and increased convenience. In the HPA process, the acridinium ester, or AE, molecule is protected within the double-stranded helix that is formed when the probe binds to its specific target. Prior to activating the AE molecule, known as \u201clighting off,\u201d a chemical is added that destroys the AE molecule on any unhybridized probes, leaving the label on the hybridized probes largely unaffected. When the \u201clighting off\u201d or detection  7 7 7  Table of Contents Table of Contents   reagent is added to the specimen, only the label attached to the hybridized probe is left to produce a signal indicating that the target organism\u2019s DNA or RNA is present. All of these steps occur in a single tube and without any wash steps, which were required as part of conventional probe tests. Our DKA technology uses two types of AE molecules that can be differentiated from each other \u2014 one that \u201cflashes\u201d and another one that \u201cglows.\u201d By using DKA technology, we have created nucleic acid test, or NAT, assays that can detect two separate targets simultaneously. ThinPrep System \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ThinPrep System is the most widely used method for cervical cancer screening in the U.S. The ThinPrep System has multiple configurations, including one or more of the following: the ThinPrep 2000 Processor, ThinPrep 5000 Processor, ThinPrep 5000 Processor with Autoloader, ThinPrep Genesis Processor, ThinPrep Imaging System, ThinPrep Integrated Imager, and related reagents, filters and other supplies, such as the ThinPrep Pap Test and our ThinPrep PreservCyt Solution. The ThinPrep Process.\u00a0The ThinPrep process begins with the patient\u2019s cervical sample being obtained by the physician using a cervical sampling device that, rather than being smeared on a microscope slide as in a conventional Pap smear, is inserted into a vial filled with our proprietary ThinPrep PreservCyt Solution. This enables most of the patient\u2019s cell samples to be preserved before the cells can be damaged by air drying. The ThinPrep specimen vial is then labeled and sent to a laboratory equipped with a ThinPrep Processor for slide preparation. At the laboratory, the ThinPrep specimen vial is inserted into a ThinPrep Processor, a proprietary sample preparation device, which automates the process of preparing cervical slides for staining and microscopic examination. Additionally, an aliquot used for subsequent molecular testing can be produced using the ThinPrep Genesis Processor. In the case of manual screening, the cytotechnologist screens each Pap test slide with a microscope to first determine the adequacy of the slide and then to examine the entire slide to differentiate diseased or abnormal cells from normal cells. With the ThinPrep Imaging Systems, the screening process has been automated to combine the power of computer imaging technology with human interpretive skills. Prior to human review, the ThinPrep Imaging Systems rapidly scan, locate and highlight areas of interest for review. By directing the cytotechnologist to areas of interest on a slide, these systems may increase a cytology laboratory\u2019s screening productivity and diagnostic accuracy.  Additional Applications.\u00a0In addition to serving as a replacement for the conventional Pap smear, the ThinPrep System can also be used for non-gynecological cytology screening applications including fine-needle aspiration specimens (e.g., breast, thyroid, lung or liver), body fluids (e.g., urine, pleural fluid, ascitic fluid or pericardial fluid), respiratory specimens (e.g., sputum or brushing of respiratory tracts) and ancillary testing (e.g., cell blocks, immunocytochemistry or special stains). Genius Digital Diagnostics The Genius Digital Diagnostics System is the first CE-marked digital cytology platform to combine a new artificial intelligence, or AI, algorithm with advanced volumetric imaging technology to help cytotechnologists and pathologists identify pre-cancerous lesions and cervical cancer cells in women. The Genius Digital Diagnostics System consists of an advanced digital imager featuring volumetric imaging technology, a secure image management server to store images, a deep learning-based AI algorithm that is designed to assist healthcare providers in detecting pre-cancerous lesions and cervical cancer cells, and a high-resolution review station for local or remote case review. The Genius Digital Diagnostics System can rapidly analyze all cells on a ThinPrep Pap test digital image, narrowing tens of thousands of cells down to an AI-generated gallery of images that have been selected as the most diagnostically relevant images, which gives healthcare providers additional critical information to help guide earlier detection and make better treatment decisions for patients. The Genius Digital Diagnostics System was CE-marked for diagnostic use in November 2020, and we have submitted a De Novo request to the FDA to grant class II marketing authorization for the product in the U.S. Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test The Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test is a single-use disposable test used to determine a woman\u2019s risk of pre-term birth by detecting the presence of a specific protein, fetal fibronectin, in vaginal secretions during pregnancy. The test utilizes a single-use, disposable cassette and is analyzed on our instrument, the TLi IQ System. Oncology Product Offerings  Our Biotheranostics business offers two proprietary laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, that support physicians in the treatment of cancer: the Breast Cancer Index test and the CancerTYPE ID test. The Breast Cancer Index, or BCI, test is a PCR-based gene expression test used for determining which patients with early-stage, hormone-receptor positive, or HR+, breast cancer are likely to benefit from extended endocrine therapy. In January 2021, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network revised its clinical practice guidelines to include BCI as the only gene expression assay to predict benefit from extended endocrine therapy for patients with early-stage HR+ breast cancer. In addition, in April 2022 the American Society of Clinical  8 8 8  Table of Contents Table of Contents   Oncology updated its clinical practice guidelines, which now include BCI as the only genomic test to help guide extended endocrine therapy decisions in early-stage, HR+ breast cancer patients. The CancerTYPE ID test is a PCR-based gene expression test that is designed to identify the source of metastatic cancer in order to improve diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment decisions. Both of these LDTs are offered as a service solely out of Biotheranostics' licensed, CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory in San Diego, California.  Mobidiag Product Offerings Our Mobidiag business develops and markets PCR-based tests for acute care conditions such as gastrointestinal and respiratory infections (including SARS-CoV-2), antimicrobial resistance management, and healthcare associated infections. The Amplidiag and Novodiag platforms are automated instruments that deliver rapid turnaround times ranging from 50 minutes to two hours. The Novodiag instrument combines real-time PCR and microarray capabilities to provide high level multiplexing, assisting clinicians in efficiently identifying which organism is responsible for an infection. Although Mobidiag currently does not offer any of its products in the U.S., we intend to invest in assay development to drive growth of the Novodiag instrument, including seeking clearance for the Novodiag instrument and related assays in the U.S. Breast Health Products Mammography Solutions \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Dimensions platform includes the Selenia Dimensions and 3Dimensions systems capable of performing full field digital mammography (2D) and digital breast tomosynthesis (3D) exams. When performing a 3D exam, each system acquires a series of low dose x-ray images taken in a scanning motion at various angles. The images are mathematically reconstructed into a series of small contiguous slices, allowing for visualization of the breast tissue through multiple layers. Our clinical results for FDA approval demonstrate that conventional 2D digital mammography with the addition of our Genius 3D Mammography is superior to 2D digital mammography alone for both screening and diagnostics. Hologic Clarity HD technology provides our highest resolution imaging, and our C-View and Intelligent 2D software products generate 2D images that are mathematically synthesized from the tomosynthesis data. These software products are FDA approved to replace conventional 2D images within a 3D exam. Synthesized 2D images eliminate the need for additional 2D exposure, reducing breast compression time and patient dose compared to a \u201ccombo\u201d exam, which includes a tomosynthesis exam and a conventional digital 2D exam.   Our 3DQuorum technology is an artificial intelligence, or AI, powered algorithm that expedites mammography exam reading time without compromising image quality, sensitivity or accuracy. The 3DQuorum technology uniquely reconstructs Hologic Clarity HD 3D data to produce 6 mm \u201cSmartSlices.\u201d By utilizing 3DQuorum technology the number of 3D images to review is reduced by two-thirds, saving an estimated average of one hour per eight hours of daily image interpretation time. The 3DQuorum technology also reduces the typical Hologic Clarity HD and Intelligent 2D study size by approximately 50%, bringing the storage space and network impact back down to that of standard resolution 3D imaging.   The images captured by digital mammography systems are typically transmitted electronically for review by a radiologist at a reading workstation. To address this process, we offer the SecurViewDX workstation approved for interpretation of mammograms as well as images from other diagnostic breast modalities including breast ultrasound and breast MRI. We also offer image analytic products such as the Genius AI Detection solution (Hologic\u2019s first artificial intelligence cancer detection algorithm utilizing deep-learning technology for tomosynthesis), ImageChecker CAD-solution (provides markings of suspicious areas of the breast that may be cancerous), and Quantra software (automates breast density measurement for our mammography systems). These technologies provide reviewers with the potential to focus on key patients that might otherwise be overlooked during the review process for additional diagnostic workups, thus potentially increasing cancer detection. Stereotactic Breast Biopsy Systems \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We provide clinicians flexibility by offering two minimally invasive stereotactic breast biopsy guidance systems: the Affirm prone and the Affirm upright breast biopsy guidance systems. The Affirm upright biopsy system is an attachment designed to integrate with our Dimensions systems, transforming it into a versatile tool for both screening and tomosynthesis biopsy. The Affirm prone biopsy system is a dedicated prone stereotactic biopsy system capable of both 2D and tomosynthesis-guided procedures. These systems provide an alternative to open surgical biopsy and can be performed as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, allowing shorter recovery times. The Affirm tomosynthesis option provides faster lesion targeting and reduced patient procedure time compared to traditional stereotactic biopsy procedures. The Affirm system is pre-programmed for use with our Brevera, Eviva and ATEC vacuum-assisted breast biopsy devices. Breast Biopsy and Surgery Products \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9 9 9  Table of Contents Table of Contents   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We offer a wide range of minimally invasive products for breast biopsy and breast surgery. Our breast biopsy portfolio includes three types of tethered vacuum-assisted breast biopsy products: the Brevera, ATEC, and Eviva devices. Each tethered device is powered by a console and utilizes our fluid management system. The ATEC device can be used under all standard imaging guidance modalities (stereotactic x-ray, ultrasound, MRI and molecular breast imaging) whereas our Brevera and Eviva devices are used exclusively under stereotactic x-ray guidance. We also offer the Celero and Sertera biopsy devices, both of which are non-tethered (no separate console), spring-loaded, disposable core biopsy devices, which are used exclusively under ultrasound-guidance. We also have products for marking, localizing and filling the void after surgery in addition to specimen imaging products for radiology, surgery and pathology. GYN Surgical Products MyoSure \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The MyoSure system is designed to provide efficient and effective hysteroscopic removal of tissue within the uterus, including fibroids and polyps. Removal of fibroids can provide effective relief from heavy menstrual bleeding commonly attributed to such pathology. Unlike other methods of tissue removal, the excavated tissue samples remain intact, which allows them to be tested for abnormalities. The MyoSure system consists of a tissue removal device, control unit, and hysteroscope. The MyoSure tissue removal device is single-use and features simultaneous tissue cutting and removal. The device incorporates a rapidly rotating and reciprocating cutting blade. During the procedure, the tissue removal device is inserted through the MyoSure hysteroscope. This tissue removal device is powered by a control unit, which features a simple user interface and is foot pedal activated. We offer multiple handpiece devices that differ in size and are focused on addressing different pathology types. NovaSure \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The NovaSure CLASSIC endometrial ablation system allows physicians to treat women suffering from abnormal uterine bleeding. The system features Smart-Depth technology that continuously monitors and measures tissue impedance to provide a more customized, reliable and reproducible depth of ablation for every patient. The NovaSure system consists of a disposable device and a controller that delivers Radio Frequency (RF) energy to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in order to eliminate or reduce the patient\u2019s abnormal bleeding. The NovaSure disposable device is a hand-held, single-use device that incorporates a flexible gold-plated mesh electrode used to deliver the RF energy to the endometrial tissue. The NovaSure RF Controller generates and delivers RF energy customized for each patient, monitors several critical treatment and safety parameters, and automatically controls the endpoint of the procedure. We also offer the NovaSure ADVANCED and NovaSure V5 devices, which have a slimmer diameter. These devices are designed to improve patient comfort and physician ease-of-use while maintaining the clinical efficacy of the NovaSure system. Fluent Fluid Management System \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Fluent Fluid Management System can be utilized for diagnostic and operative hysteroscopic procedures, including MyoSure tissue removal. Fluent features an intuitive touch screen design, innovative FloPak design, and a single waste bag design that eliminates the need for multiple canisters. Therefore, Fluent is designed for simplified setup and operation, and streamlined workflow for the operating room team. Acessa ProVu System \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Acessa ProVu system is used by laparoscopic surgeons to treat fibroids using controlled radiofrequency energy (heat) to cause coagulative necrosis. The treated tissue softens and shrinks over time, allowing fibroid symptoms to resolve without more invasive treatment. The Acessa system includes an ultrasound probe to locate the fibroids, guidance mapping that provides visual cues, and a percutaneous handpiece that deploys radiofrequency energy. Advanced Energy and Surgical Stapling The CoolSeal vessel sealing suite and JustRight surgical stapler bolster our laparoscopic surgical offerings with the advanced vessel sealing, dividing, dissection, and stapling tools. The CoolSeal device allows for dissection, vessel sealing and dividing all in one tool. The ability to use a combination device improves surgical efficiency by reducing the need for instrument exchanges. In addition, the CoolSeal Mini 3 mm sealer and the JustRight 5 mm stapler are designed for small surgical spaces such as in pediatric cases, which can help reduce the need for larger, overpowered instruments.  Skeletal Health Products Horizon DXA Systems Bone densitometry is the measurement of bone density to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis and other  10 10 10  Table of Contents Table of Contents   metabolic bone diseases that can lead to frailty and debilitating bone fractures. Osteoporosis is a disease that is most prevalent in post-menopausal women. Our Horizon line of x-ray bone densitometers incorporates advanced features designed for bone health screening and body composition assessment. Body composition assessment is the precise measurement of bone, lean mass, and fat mass within the body. These measurements are valued within the health and wellness and human performance categories, informing nutrition and exercise programming decisions.  Fluoroscan Insight FD Our Fluoroscan Insight FD is a mini C-arm imaging system that provides low intensity, real-time x-ray imaging, with high-resolution images at radiation levels and at a cost below those of conventional x-ray and standard sized fluoroscopic equipment. Mini C-arm systems are used primarily by orthopedic surgeons to assist in performing minimally invasive surgical procedures on a patient\u2019s extremities, such as the hand, wrist, knee, foot and ankle. Marketing, Sales and Service We sell and service our products through a combination of direct sales and service forces and a network of independent distributors and sales representatives. In fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. Our U.S. sales force is structured to specifically target the customers in each of our business segments. We maintain distinct teams focused on the Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical, and Skeletal Health markets. Our end customers include clinical laboratories, hospitals, healthcare providers and surgeons in both hospital and office settings, and we target various specialists at healthcare entities who use our products, such as ob-gyns, radiologists and breast surgeons.  A critical element of our strategy in the U.S. for our Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical, and Skeletal Health divisions has been to utilize the results of our clinical trials and expanded FDA labeling to demonstrate safety, efficacy and productivity improvements to our target customers. Our U.S. sales efforts also include the use of national account managers focused on obtaining purchasing contracts from large purchasing entities, such as managed care organizations, integrated delivery networks and government healthcare facilities. In addition, in certain regions of the U.S., we use a limited number of independent dealers or distributors to sell and service certain of our products. Internationally, our products in all divisions are marketed and sold through a combination of our direct sales force and a network of distributors. Our service organization is responsible for installing our products and providing warranty and repair services, applications training and biomedical training. Products sold by our direct sales force typically carry limited warranties covering parts and labor for twelve months. Products sold through dealers also carry limited warranties that are typically for twelve months and cover only parts and components. We also offer service contracts that generally cover equipment and maintenance after the original warranty period from one to three years. We provide both repair services and routine maintenance services under these arrangements, and also offer repair and maintenance services on a time and materials basis to customers that do not have service contracts. Our Breast Health business generates a majority of our service revenue from service contracts for our digital mammography portfolio. Internationally, we primarily use distributors, sales representatives and third parties to provide maintenance service for our products, however we do provide direct service in countries where we have a subsidiary (Germany, UK, France, Spain, Japan, China, and Australia). Competition The healthcare industry is highly competitive and characterized by continual change and improvements in technology. This is particularly the case in the market segments in which we operate. A number of companies have developed or are expected to develop products that compete or will compete with our products. Many of these competitors offer a broader product portfolio and have greater brand recognition than we do, which may make these competitors more attractive to hospitals, radiology clients, group purchasing organizations, laboratories, physicians and other potential customers. Competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality for sale at the same or lower prices. Moreover, our products could be rendered obsolete by changes to industry standards or guidelines or advances in technology. We can give no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors. 11 11 11  Table of Contents Table of Contents   In the current environment of managed care, economically motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures are putting additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and market sizes. We believe that the success of our products depends on our ability to differentiate ourselves and to demonstrate that our products deliver the clinical and operational attributes that are most important and cost-effective to customers. These attributes include, but are not limited to, superiority in efficacy, ease of use, reliability, accuracy, quality and cost. We believe our continued success depends in large part upon our ability to invest in product enhancements and technologies that will help us distinguish ourselves from our competitors. Diagnostics.\u00a0Our ThinPrep liquid-based cytology product faces direct competition in the U.S. primarily from Becton, Dickinson and Company, or BD, which manufactures a competitive offering. We also compete with the conventional Pap smear and other alternative methods for detecting cervical cancer and/or its precursors. Internationally, our ThinPrep product competes with a variety of companies and other non-FDA approved tests, since the devices often have lower risk classification with fewer regulatory barriers in many international markets as compared to the U.S. Additionally, testing volume in this category is also under pressure due to clinical guideline changes, which lengthen the interval between screenings and increasingly afford the option of HPV testing as the primary means of detection. We believe that our Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test is currently the only available in vitro diagnostic test for predicting the risk of pre-term birth in the U.S. Internationally, our Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test competes with Actim Partus manufactured by Medix Biochemica and PartoSure manufactured by Qiagen GmbH, or Qiagen. However, our Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test could also experience competition from companies that manufacture and market pregnancy-related diagnostic products and services. In addition, healthcare providers use diagnostic techniques such as clinical examination and transvaginal ultrasound to help diagnose the likelihood of pre-term birth and may use these techniques together with the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test or instead of using the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test.  In the molecular diagnostics market, our products compete with many companies in the U.S. and abroad engaged in the development, commercialization and distribution of similar products intended for clinical molecular diagnostic applications. Clinical laboratories also may offer testing services that are competitive with our products and may use reagents purchased from us or others to develop their own laboratory developed tests. The market for our COVID-19 assays is rapidly evolving both in the United States and in the rest of the world. For example, in the United States over 400 assays have received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, and we compete with the providers of all of these tests, including manufacturers of molecular diagnostic tests (including so-called high throughput nucleic acid tests, rapid antigen tests and at-home testing solutions), and antibody tests, as well clinical laboratories making their own laboratory developed tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. In the global clinical diagnostics market, we compete with several companies offering alternative technologies to our diagnostic products. For example, in the U.S., our Aptima Combo 2 test competes against Abbott Laboratories, BD, Danaher Corporation (through its acquisition of Cepheid), and Roche Diagnostics Corporation, or Roche, and our Aptima HPV test competes with tests marketed by BD, Qiagen and Roche. Breast Health.\u00a0Our mammography and related products and subsystems compete on a worldwide basis with products offered by a number of competitors, including General Electric Company, or GE, Siemens AG, or Siemens, Koninklijke Philips NV, or Philips, Planmed Oy, or Planmed, Carestream Health, Inc., or Carestream, FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, or Fuji, Internazionale Medico Scientifica Srl, or I.M.S., and Toshiba Corporation. In the U.S., our digital mammography systems compete with digital mammography systems from GE, Siemens, Fuji, and Philips. Our digital mammography systems also compete with Fuji\u2019s and Carestream's Computed Radiography, or CR mammography systems, and other lower-priced alternatives to 2D digital mammography and analog mammography systems. In the U.S., GE, Siemens and Fuji have received FDA approval for their breast tomosynthesis systems, and we believe that other competitors are developing tomosynthesis systems for commercial use in the U.S. Our Dimensions tomosynthesis systems also compete in certain countries outside of the U.S. with tomosynthesis systems developed by GE, Siemens, Fuji, and I.M.S. The primary competitor for our breast biopsy product line is Devicor Medical Products, Inc., part of Danaher Corporation's Leica Biosystems division. In addition, other competitors include CareFusion, a BD company and Intact Medical Corporation. GYN Surgical.\u00a0Our MyoSure product competes directly with hysteroscopic loop resection, as well as hysteroscopic tissue removal systems such as Medtronic plc\u2019s TruClear device and Minerva's Symphion device. The MyoSure product also competes with alternative therapeutic techniques such as hysteroscopic resection with a monopolar or bipolar loop, which is currently the most common technique for removing intrauterine fibroids and polyps. 12 12 12  Table of Contents Table of Contents   Our NovaSure system currently faces direct competition from The Cooper Companies, Inc., or CooperSurgical, and Minerva Surgical, Inc., or Minerva, each of which currently markets an FDA-approved endometrial ablation device for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. In addition to these devices, we also compete with alternative treatments to our NovaSure system, such as drug therapy, intrauterine devices, hysterectomy, dilation and curettage and rollerball ablation. Because drug therapy is an alternative to our NovaSure procedure, NovaSure\u2019s competitors also include many major pharmaceutical companies that manufacture hormonal drugs for women. Our Acessa ProVu system competes directly with Gynesonics, Inc., which currently markets a radiofrequency ablation device for treating uterine fibroids. The Acessa ProVu system also competes with alternative fibroid treatment options such as hysterectomy, laparoscopic myomectomy, and uterine artery embolization. Our CoolSeal vessel sealing suite competes directly with Applied Medical's Voyant vessel sealing, Medtronic's LigaSure vessel sealing, Ethicon's ENSEAL vessel sealing and Olympus' THUNDERBEAT and POWERSEAL vessel sealing devices. CoolSeal also competes with ultrasonic energy sealing procedures done by Medtronic's Sonicision and Ethicon's HARMONIC sealing devices. Skeletal Health.\u00a0GE is our primary competitor in the bone densitometry market, and we also compete with Orthoscan Inc. in the mini C-arm market. Manufacturing We purchase many of the components, subassemblies, and raw materials used in our products from numerous suppliers worldwide. For reasons of quality assurance, scarcity and/or cost effectiveness, certain components, subassemblies, and raw materials used in our products are available only from one or a limited number of suppliers. We work closely with our suppliers to develop contingency plans to ensure continuity of quality and reliable supply. We have established long-term supply contracts with many of our suppliers, and in other instances, we developed in-house capability to offset potential shortages caused by sole source suppliers. Due to the high standards and FDA requirements applicable to manufacturing our products, such as the FDA's Quality System Regulation and Good Manufacturing Practices, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions have had an adverse impact on our supply chains. Moreover, we use certain components in our products, including semiconductor chips, which have been the subject of recent global supply chain shortages and disruptions. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or components or subassemblies on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information about supply chain shortages and disruptions to which our business is subject, see the disclosures under the caption \u201cSupply Chain Considerations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report.  Our current supplier of certain key raw materials for certain of our amplified NAT diagnostic assays is Roche, a direct competitor of our Diagnostics business.  We have sole source third-party contract manufacturers for each of our molecular diagnostics instrument product lines and for our Skeletal Health products. Stratec SE, or Stratec, is the only manufacturer of the Panther and Panther Fusion instruments; and Flextronics Medical Sales and Marketing, LTD, or Flextronics, is the only manufacturer of our Skeletal Health finished goods products. We are dependent on these sole source third-party manufacturers, and this dependence exposes us to increased risks associated with production delays, delivery schedules, manufacturing capability, quality control, quality assurance and costs. We have no firm long-term volume commitments with either Stratec or Flextronics. If Stratec, Flextronics or any of our other third-party manufacturers experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in its development or manufacturing operations, curtails operations or otherwise fails to supply us with products in sufficient quantities, instrument and equipment shipments to our customers could be delayed or cancelled, which would decrease our revenues and may harm our competitive position and reputation. Further, because we place orders with our manufacturers based on forecasts of expected demand for our instruments and Skeletal Health products, if we inaccurately forecast demand, we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity or adequate quantities of components to meet our customers' delivery requirements.  We, and our contract manufacturers, manufacture our products at a limited number of different facilities located in the U.S. and throughout the world. In most cases, the manufacturing of each of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Some of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the U.S., including in Costa Rica and the United Kingdom. Those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations described under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report. 13 13 13  Table of Contents Table of Contents    From time-to-time new regulations are enacted that can affect the content and manufacturing of our products. We evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. In August 2012, the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, which are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The conflict minerals rule requires companies annually to disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The conflict minerals rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.  Other regulations which affect the content and manufacturing of our products include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances, or REACH, the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or RoHS, and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or WEEE, enacted in the European Union which require the registration of and regulate the use of certain hazardous substances and chemicals in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture. Similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan and China and various states of the U.S. may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials. These redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions, result in additional costs or have other similar negative effects. Research and Development The markets in which we participate are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. Investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. Our research and development efforts are focused on the further development and improvement of our existing products, the design and development of new innovative medical technologies and regulatory compliance across all our business segments. In addition to product development, our research and development personnel play an active role in the review of product specifications, clinical protocols and FDA submissions, as well as ensuring that certain of our products conform to European health, safety and environmental requirements, or CE-marking.  Patents and Proprietary Rights We rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and confidentiality procedures to protect our products and technology. Due to the rapid technological changes that characterize the markets we operate in, we believe that trade secrets and other unpatented know-how relied upon in connection with the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are generally as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Nevertheless, we have obtained patents and will continue to make efforts to obtain patents, when available, in connection with our product development programs. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. We own numerous U.S. patents and have applied for numerous additional U.S. patents relating to our technologies. We also own or have applied for corresponding patents in selected foreign countries. These patents relate to various aspects of most of our products. We do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the full scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated. There is a risk that our patent applications will not result in granted patents or that granted patents will not provide significant protection for our products and technology. Third parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights, or copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. Our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology that our patents do not cover. In addition, because patent applications in the U.S. are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, unpublished applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to our technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as intellectual property laws in the U.S. The rights provided by a patent are finite in time. Over the coming years, certain patents relating to current products will expire in the U.S. and abroad which may allow third parties to exploit those technologies. In the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology. 14 14 14  Table of Contents Table of Contents   In addition to the patents we have been issued or we have acquired, we license patents from others on a variety of terms and conditions. We are engaged in intellectual property litigation, and we may be notified in the future of claims that we may be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. In connection with any such claims, we may seek to enter into settlement and/or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. Alternatively, we may decide or be required to litigate such claims. A successful claim against us may require us to remove the alleged infringing product from the market or to design around the third party's patent, potentially resulting in less market demand for the product. Regulatory The manufacture, sale, lease and service of medical diagnostic and surgical devices intended for commercial use are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the FDA in the U.S. and by a variety of regulatory agencies in other countries. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, known as the FD&C Act, manufacturers of medical products and devices must comply with certain regulations governing the design, testing, manufacturing, packaging, servicing and marketing of medical products. Some of our products are also subject to the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, administered by the FDA, which imposes performance standards and record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements for devices that emit radiation, such as x-rays. FDA product approvals may be withdrawn or suspended if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing.   The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes based on risk. Regulatory control increases from Class I (lowest risk) to Class III (highest risk). The FDA generally must clear or approve the commercial sale of new medical devices in Classes II and III. Commercial sales of our Class II (except for Class II exempt devices) and Class III medical devices within the U.S. must be preceded by either a pre-market notification filing pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (Class II) or the granting of a pre-market approval, or PMA (Class III). Our Class I and Class II exempt medical devices must follow Hologic\u2019s internal Quality System processes prior to commercialization and throughout their product lifecycle. We must meet requirements under FDA's quality system regulation (QSR), establishment registration, medical device listing, labeling and medical device reporting (MDR) regulations. The FDA can authorize the emergency use of an unapproved medical product or an unapproved use of an approved medical product, referred to as Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, for certain emergency circumstances after the Health and Human Services Secretary has made a declaration of emergency justifying authorization of emergency use. An EUA allows use in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by emerging infectious disease threats when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The FDA may also waive otherwise-applicable current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements to accommodate emergency response needs. In March 2020, the FDA granted EUA for our Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay for testing for the COVID-19 virus. In May 2020, the FDA granted EUA for our Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay for use on our standard Panther instrument.  A 510(k) pre-market notification filing must contain information establishing that the device to be sold is substantially equivalent to a device commercially distributed prior to May 28, 1976 or to a device that has been determined by the FDA to be substantially equivalent. The PMA process involves a complex and lengthy testing process that is subject to review by the FDA and may require several years to obtain. We may need to first obtain an investigational device exemption (for significant risk devices), known as an IDE, in order to conduct extensive clinical testing of the device to obtain the necessary clinical data for submission to the FDA. The FDA will approve a PMA only if after evaluating the supporting technical data it finds that the PMA contains sufficient, valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). This approval may be granted with post-approval requirements including inspection of manufacturing facilities and/or additional patient follow-up for an indefinite period of time.  Our Biotheranostics laboratory in San Diego, California and the laboratories that purchase certain of our products, including the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 EUA, Aptima Flu Multiplex EUA, Fusion SARS-CoV-2 EUA, ThinPrep System, ThinPrep Imaging System, Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test, Aptima Combo 2, Aptima HPV tests and Aptima HIV-1 Quant, HCV Quant Dx, HBV Quant, Aptima Trichomonas Vaginalis (Trich), Aptima Mycoplasma Genitalium (MGen), Aptima HSV 1 & 2, Aptima BV, Aptima CV/TV, and Panther Fusion Assays are subject to extensive regulation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, which requires laboratories to meet specified standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Adverse interpretations of current CLIA regulations or future changes in CLIA regulations could have an adverse effect on sales of any affected products or services. These laboratories are also licensed by the appropriate state agencies in the states in which they operate, where such licensure is required. In addition, our laboratories hold state licenses or permits, as applicable, from various states to the extent that they accept specimens from one or more of these states, each of which requires out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure. If a laboratory is out of compliance with CLIA or with state laws or regulations governing  15 15 15  Table of Contents Table of Contents   licensed laboratories, penalties may include suspension, limitation or revocation of the license or CLIA certificate, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment. Loss of a laboratory's CLIA certificate or state license may also result in the inability to receive payments from state and federal health care programs as well as private third-party payors.   Certain analyte specific reagents, referred to as ASR products, as with other Class I products, may be sold without 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. However, ASR products are subject to significant restrictions. The manufacturer may not make clinical or analytical performance claims for the ASR product, may not promote their use with specific laboratory equipment and may only sell the ASR product to clinical laboratories that are qualified to run high complexity tests under CLIA. Each laboratory must validate the ASR product for use in diagnostic procedures as a laboratory developed test.   We are also subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws which broadly relate to our interactions with healthcare practitioners and other participants in the healthcare system, including, among others, the following:  \u2022anti-kickback and anti-bribery laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, the UK\u2019s Bribery Act 2010, or the UK Anti-Bribery Act; \u2022laws regulating the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released and/or collected, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR; and \u2022healthcare reform laws, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as PPACA, which include new regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs, as well as stringent new reporting requirements of financial relationships between device manufacturers and physicians and teaching hospitals.  In addition, we are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign and local laws relating to safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, data privacy and protection among others. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future and complying with these laws may result in a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Sales of medical devices outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign requirements that vary widely from country to country. For example, our ability to market our products outside of the U.S. is contingent upon maintaining our International Standards Organization, or ISO, Quality System certification, complying with European directives and in some cases receiving specific marketing authorization from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign registration is an ongoing process as we register additional products and/or product modifications.  The time required to obtain approval from a foreign country to market and sell our products may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ. In addition, we may be required to meet the FDA\u2019s export requirements or receive FDA export approval for the export of our products to foreign countries.  Our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies. For example, the EU has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the \u201cEU MDR\u201d) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the \u201cEU IVDR\u201d), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices had until May 2021 to meet the requirements of the EU MDR and had until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR. Complying with the requirements of these regulations has required us to, and may continue to require us to, incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. The recently rebranded National Medical Products Administration (formerly CFDA), or the NMPA, has historically been conservative leading to extended review times. However, more recently, the NMPA has been more interactive, which we attribute to its response to the long delays in getting lifesaving medical devices into China. If this continues, this could favorably affect our ability to introduce new products in the Chinese market.  The regulatory environment in China continues to evolve, and officials in the Chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations. It is possible that the Chinese government's current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our China operations, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties.  16 16 16  Table of Contents Table of Contents   We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize the healthcare industry closely and that changes in laws, regulations or policies by governmental authorities may cause increases in uncertainties and compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our business and operations. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for future products could delay or preclude realization of product revenues from new products or result in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability.  For additional information about the regulations to which our business is subject and the impact such regulations may have on our business, see the disclosures under the captions \u201cManufacturing\u201d and \u201cReimbursement\u201d in this Item 1, and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A below. Reimbursement Market acceptance of our medical products in the U.S. and other countries is dependent upon the purchasing and procurement practices of our customers and patient need for our products and procedures and, the coverage and reimbursement of patients\u2019 medical expenses by government healthcare programs, private insurers or other healthcare payors. In the U.S., the Centers for Medicare\u00a0& Medicaid Services, known as CMS, establishes coverage policies and payment rates for Medicare beneficiaries. CMS publishes payment rates for physician, hospital, laboratory and ambulatory surgical center services on an annual basis. Under current CMS policies and regulations, varying payment levels have been established for tests and procedures performed using our products. Coverage policies for Medicare patients may vary by regional Medicare contractor in the absence of a national coverage determination and payment rates for procedures may vary based on the geographic price index. Coverage policies and reimbursement rates for Medicaid patients are dependent on each state Medicaid plan and will vary. Coverage policies and reimbursement rates for patients with private insurance are dependent on state and federal requirements as well as individual private payor\u2019s decisions. Moreover, private insurance carriers may choose not to follow the CMS coverage policies or payment rates. The use of our products outside of the U.S. is similarly affected by reimbursement policies adopted by foreign regulatory authorities and insurance carriers. Healthcare policy and payment reform proposals and medical cost containment measures are being adopted in the U.S. and in many foreign countries. The ability of our customers to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products and services from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement and coverage vary by country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products and technologies. Even if we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval and coverage is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. Further, ongoing legislative or administrative reform to the reimbursement system in the U.S. and other countries may impact reimbursement for procedures using our medical products and/or limit coverage for those procedures facilitated by our products. This includes price regulation, competitive bidding and tendering, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements. These trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Human Capital We view human capital management and the strength of our employees as integral to the long-term success of our business and the strengthening of our communities. We understand that we rely on our employees worldwide to propel our organization forward with great ideas, innovations and leadership.  As of September\u00a030, 2023, we had 6,990 full-time employees, including 2,120 in manufacturing operations, 1,714 in sales and marketing, 1,485 in support services, 908 in research and development, and 763 in general administration. Approximately 3,998 of these employees are in the U.S. and approximately 2,992 were outside the U.S. In various countries outside the U.S., certain of our employees are unionized and, where local law requires, participate in works councils.  Employee Engagement and Development Our goal is to develop and maintain a talented, engaged and diverse workforce that has a positive impact on our performance, and on our customers and their patients. We have been conducting an annual engagement survey since 2015 in which most of our employees regularly participate. We believe our foundation of employee engagement, our commitment to our employees, and their commitment to each other fortifies our leaders and teams and improves their business performance. We also offer a range of programs to develop our managers and enhance our leadership across the Company. Our professional development efforts are aimed at increasing organizational talent and capabilities and identifying and developing potential successors for key leadership positions.  17 17 17  Table of Contents Table of Contents   Compensation and Benefits Our compensation philosophy aims to attract and retain top talent for today and the future. To this end, we invest in the physical, emotional and financial well-being of our employees through our robust compensation and benefit programs. These programs (which vary by country/region) include a variety of health plan options, tax-favorable savings accounts and other wellness offerings.  Diversity Drives Performance We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment that promotes equal opportunity, dignity and respect, starting with our Board and our Leadership team. Of our ten directors, five, representing 50% of the Board, are women, two of our directors self-identify as Asian and another self-identifies as African American. For each of the past 11 years, women have comprised over 30% of our Board. Also, four of our directors were born outside of the United States, and three were predominantly educated outside of the United States, which we believe promotes global diversity for our Board. We believe that our focus on the lives of women has helped us to attract a diverse workforce and build an inclusive ethos where different perspectives are valued and respected. Building a diverse workforce begins with our hiring practices and extends to our access to opportunities, strategic development and promotion of internal talent. We seek to identify and develop high-potential women and other diverse individuals within the Company. In addition to women holding several key roles within the Company (Chief Financial Officer; President, Diagnostic Solutions; Vice President, Global Tax and Treasury; Vice President of Finance, Breast and Skeletal Health; Vice President of Internal Audit; and Chief of Staff), African American leaders have assumed important leadership roles as Division President, GYN Surgical, Vice President of Sales, Breast and Skeletal Health and Corporate Secretary. Additionally, given that our commercial teams are an important pipeline for senior management, we are pleased that a significant number of our commercial team members below the level of vice president are women and/or people of color.  We strive to hire the most qualified person for the job and believe that, over time, this will lead to an increasingly diverse workforce. As a part of finding the most qualified people, we are committed to ensuring that diverse slates of candidates are identified and considered for all roles, from the boardroom and c-suite to all levels of the workforce. We believe our focus on talent identification, development, engagement and succession planning has been particularly successful in developing a deep and diverse talent pipeline.  Health and Safety We seek to comply in letter and in spirit with applicable health and safety laws and regulations and implement programs, policies and procedures to achieve compliance throughout the Company. We also establish our own environmental health and safety standards in addition to those that are legally required. We employ management systems and procedures designed to protect human safety, health, and the environment. In fact, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we took additional health and safety measures. We seek to reduce risk and protect our employees and communities by employing safe technologies and operating procedures, and by maintaining a business continuity program to stay prepared for emergencies. We have also developed safety rules and procedures to address behaviors and work practices that can lead to accidents and injuries. Safety performance is assessed throughout the year by management and during annual performance reviews.  In addition, we have developed several employee-focused initiatives to support the physical, mental, and financial well-being of our employees. These initiatives include providing enhanced accident and critical illness insurance, access to telehealth services, developing an employee assistance program that provides mental health therapy, wellness coaching, and medication management, and offering subscriptions to self-care mobile apps. Community Engagement and Volunteerism We take the role we play as leaders in the communities where we live and work seriously. Our philanthropic and charitable efforts are an important part of our culture. We center our giving efforts in three specific areas to maximize our impact in ways that align with the values of our employees and customers: (i) women's health, and other healthcare fields in which Hologic operates; (ii) science, technology, engineering, and math education (STEM), especially for underprivileged groups; and (iii) social and racial equality, especially in healthcare. In fiscal 2022, we announced an expansion of our philanthropic activities, pledging to donate $5 million from our charitable fund over the year to further support the communities where our employees live and work. In fiscal 2023, we continued to support a variety of philanthropic activities. We also support employees in giving back to community organizations through volunteering and matching donations. To that end, we further expanded our support for local non-profit groups, by providing our U.S. colleagues an additional paid day off to engage in community service. We also have continued to strengthen our scholarship funds. The Hologic Scholarship Fund awards scholarships of $2,500 to $5,000 for employees' children and grandchildren. We also support students near our largest U.S. facilities by providing scholarship funding to three non-profit organizations that help students from underserved communities become the first in their family to attend college. 18 18 18  Table of Contents Table of Contents   Seasonality Worldwide sales, including U.S. sales, do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, customer purchases of our GYN Surgical products have been historically lower in our second fiscal quarter compared to our other fiscal quarters. Our respiratory infectious disease product line (including our assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2) within our Diagnostics segment is also subject to significant seasonal and year-over-year fluctuations. In addition, the summer months, which occur during our fourth fiscal quarter, typically have had lower order rates internationally for most of our products.  ", "time": "00:00:05"}
