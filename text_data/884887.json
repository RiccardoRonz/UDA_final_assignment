{"cik": 884887, "item_1A": " Item 1. Business.   General We are one of the leading cruise companies in the world. We own and operate three global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our \"Global Brands\"). We also own a 50% joint venture interest in TUI Cruises GmbH (\"TUIC\"), which operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). We account for our investments in our Partner Brands under the equity method of accounting. Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands have a combined fleet of 64 ships in the cruise vacation industry with an aggregate capacity of approximately 150,005 berths as of December\u00a031, 2022. Our ships offer a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations on all seven continents. In addition to our headquarters in Miami, Florida, we have offices and a network of international representatives around the world, which primarily focus on sales and market development. We compete principally by operating valued brands that offer exceptional service provided by our crew and on the basis of innovation and quality of ships, variety of itineraries, choice of destinations and price. We believe that our commitment to build state-of-the-art ships and to invest in the maintenance and upgrade of our fleet to, among other things, incorporate many of our latest signature innovations, allows us to continue to attract new and loyal repeat guests. Royal Caribbean was founded in 1968 as a partnership. Its corporate structure has evolved over the years and, the current parent corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., was incorporated on July 23, 1985 in the Republic of Liberia under the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. As a result of the global pandemic impact of COVID-19, we paused our guest cruise operations in March 2020 and began resuming guest cruise operations in 2021, with our full fleet in service by June 2022. We continue to prioritize our financial recovery and the further enhancement of our financial results and liquidity.  Our Global Brands Our Global Brands include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises. We believe our Global Brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our Global Brands has its own marketing style, as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our Global Brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our Global Brands also offer similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our Global Brands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, we strategically manage our Global Brands as a single business with the ultimate objective of maximizing long-term shareholder value.  Royal Caribbean International Royal Caribbean International is the world's largest cruise brand. The brand competes in both the contemporary and premium segments of the cruise vacation industry and appeals to families with children of all ages, as well as both older and younger couples. Royal Caribbean International offers cruises and land destinations that generally feature a casual ambiance, as well as a variety of activities and entertainment venues. We believe that the quality of the Royal Caribbean International brand allows it to achieve market coverage that is among the broadest of any of the major cruise brands in the cruise vacation industry. Royal Caribbean International\u2019s strategy is to attract an array of vacationing guests by offering a wide variety of itineraries to destinations worldwide, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Panama Canal and New Zealand, with cruise lengths generally ranging from two to 19 nights. Royal Caribbean International offers multiple innovative options for onboard dining, entertainment and other onboard activities. Because of the brand\u2019s ability to deliver extensive and innovative product offerings at an excellent value to consumers, we believe Royal Caribbean International is well positioned to attract new consumers to cruising and to continue to bring loyal repeat guests back for their next vacation. Royal Caribbean International operates 26 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 94,100 berths. Additionally, as of December\u00a031, 2022, Royal Caribbean International had four ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 22,500 berths. The ships on order include the first three ships of a new generation of vessels, known as the Icon-class, and our sixth Oasis-class ship, Utopia of the Seas. The first Icon-class ship, Icon of the Seas, is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2023 and enter service in the first quarter of 2024, and the second and third Icon-class ships, are expected to be delivered in the second quarters of 2025 and 2026, respectively. Utopia of the Seas is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024. 2 2  2   Celebrity Cruises  Celebrity Cruises is positioned within the luxury segment of the cruise vacation industry. Celebrity Cruises\u2019 strategy is to target affluent consumers by delivering a destination-rich experience on upscale ships that offer, among other things, culinary excellence, world-class service, luxurious spaces and accommodations, and holistic wellness experiences. Celebrity Cruises offers a range of itineraries to destinations, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, New Zealand, the Panama Canal and South America, with cruise lengths ranging from three to 18 nights. Celebrity Cruises operates 15 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 32,465 berths. Additionally, as of December\u00a031, 2022, Celebrity Cruises had one Edge-class ship on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 3,250 berths. This ship, Celebrity Ascent, is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l\u2019Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship with capacity of approximately 3,250 berths, estimated for delivery in 2025, if certain conditions are met. Silversea Cruises Silversea Cruises is an ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line with smaller ships, high standards of accommodations, fine dining, personalized service and exotic itineraries. Silversea Cruises delivers distinctive destination experiences by visiting unique and remote destinations, including the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica and the Arctic with cruise itineraries generally ranging from five to 24 nights.  Silversea Cruises operates 11 ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 4,150 berths, including the brand's newest ship, Silver Endeavour, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2022 and commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, as of December\u00a031, 2022, Silversea Cruises had on order two ships of a new generation, known as the Evolution-class, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,460 berths, which are expected to be delivered in the second quarters of 2023 and 2024, respectively. The expected delivery dates for all of our ships on order are subject to change in the event of shipyard construction delays or in the event we agree to scope changes which impact the delivery timelines. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on shipyard operations.  Our Partner Brands Our Global Brands are complemented by our interest in TUIC, our 50%-owned joint venture that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). TUIC is a joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by TUI AG, a German tourism company, which is designed to serve the contemporary and premium segments of the German cruise market by offering products tailored for German guests. All onboard activities, services, shore excursions and menu offerings are designed to suit the preferences of this target market.  TUI Cruises operates seven ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 17,700 berths. Additionally, as of December\u00a031, 2022, TUI Cruises had three ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 11,100 berths, that are expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024, the fourth quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2026, respectively. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises operates two luxury liners and three smaller expedition ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,590 berths. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises did not have any ships on order as of December\u00a031, 2022.  Refer to Note 7. Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details.  Industry  The cruising industry has been considered a well-established vacation sector in the North American, European and Australian markets and a developing sector in several other emerging markets. We believe that cruising will continue to be a popular vacation choice due to its inherent value, extensive itineraries and variety of shipboard and shoreside activities. The Company and other industry participants voluntarily suspended operations in March of 2020 and gradually resumed full operations starting in the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022. As a result, comparative information regarding market penetration and other indicators are not meaningful for 2020, 2021, and 2022. For the five year period prior to 2020, industry data indicated that market penetration rates were still low and that a significant portion of cruise  3 3  3   guests carried in those years were first-time cruisers. We believe this presents an opportunity for operational and financial recovery and long-term growth for the industry. During the five year period from 2015 through 2019, industry market penetration rates (computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population) grew from 3.36% to 3.89% for North America, from 1.25% to 1.41% for Europe, and from 0.08% to 0.20% for Asia/Pacific. The increased penetration shows the continued growth potential in the markets most served by the industry.  The global cruise fleet was served by a weighted average of approximately 634,000 berths during 2022 with approximately 359 ships at the end of 2022. As of December\u00a031, 2022, there were approximately 63 ships on order with an estimated 143,000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market through 2028, not taking into account ships taken out of service or ordered during these periods. Cruise ships in the industry were taken out of service at an accelerated rate and new ship orders were deferred due to global cruise operation restrictions in 2020 and limited sailings in 2021 and 2022 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The global cruise industry carried approximately 30 million cruise guests in 2019 and approximately 28.5 million in 2018. The following table details the growth in global weighted average berths and the percentage of North American, European and Asia/Pacific cruise guests for 2022 and for each of the five years from 2015 through 2019: Year (1)Weighted-AverageSupply ofBerthsMarketedGlobally(2)Royal Caribbean Group Total Berths(3)North American Cruise Guests(2)(4)European Cruise Guests(2)(5)Asia/Pacific Cruise Guests(2)(6)Other Cruise Guests(2)2015469,000112,70052%29%14%5%2016493,000123,27051%27%19%3%2017515,000124,07048%25%20%7%2018546,000135,52049%26%20%5%2019579,000141,57047%25%24%4%2022634,000150,00565%28%2%5% Year (1) Weighted-Average Supply of Berths Marketed Globally(2) Royal Caribbean Group Total Berths(3) North American Cruise Guests(2)(4) European Cruise Guests(2)(5) Asia/Pacific Cruise Guests(2)(6) Other Cruise Guests(2) ___________________________________________________________________ (1)Historically, we have reported annual information for comparability across periods. The 2020 suspension of global cruise operations as a result of COVID-19 and the gradual resumption of full operations starting in the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022 do not allow for a meaningful comparison to prior years' information and, as such, 2020 and 2021 data has been excluded from this table. (2)Source: The estimates of the number of global cruise guests and the weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally are based on a combination of data that we obtain from various publicly available cruise industry trade information sources. We use data obtained from Seatrade Insider, Cruise Industry News and company press releases to estimate weighted-average supply of berths and CLIA and G.P. Wild to estimate cruise guest information. For 2022, cruise guest information includes data through the third quarter of 2022. In addition, our estimates incorporate our own analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base.  (3)Total berths include our berths related to our Global Brands and Partner Brands. (4)Our estimates include the United States and Canada. (5)Our estimates include European countries relevant to the industry (most notably: the Nordics, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom).  (6)Our estimates include Southeast Asia (most notably: Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines), East Asia (pre-2022, most notably: China and Japan), South Asia (most notably: India) and Oceania (most notably: Australia and New Zealand) regions. The decrease in Asia/Pacific cruise guests from 2019 to 2022 is partly driven by China remaining closed given its continued COVID-19 restrictions.  Competition We compete with a number of cruise lines and other land-based vacations. Our principal competitors are Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns, among other brands, Aida Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn; Disney Cruise Line; MSC Cruises; Norwegian  4 4  4   Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, which owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises; and Virgin Voyages. Cruise lines also compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels, internet-based alternative lodging sites and sightseeing destinations for consumers\u2019 leisure time.  Operating Strategies Our mission is to deliver the best vacation experiences to our guests, responsibly. We continue to prioritize operating strategies that support this mission as well as operating strategies that support our financial recovery and the further enhancement of our financial results and liquidity. We strive to execute these strategies in a socially and environmentally responsible manner, working with our various business and community partners as we build toward a more sustainable cruise industry.  Our Company's operating strategies are as follows: \u2022deliver the best vacation experiences to our guests, responsibly; \u2022protect the health, safety and security of our guests and employees;  \u2022deepen our customer relationships in order to enhance our revenues;  \u2022focus on cost efficiency, adequate cash and liquidity, and strengthen our balance sheet, with the overall goals of maximizing our return on invested capital and shareholder value;  \u2022protect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate, with a focus on decarbonization;  \u2022invest in our workforce in order to better serve our global guest base and grow our business, and promote gender equality, diversity and inclusion; \u2022increase the awareness and market penetration of our brands globally; \u2022strategically invest in our fleet through the upgrade and maintenance of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations, while prudently expanding our fleet with new state-of-the-art cruise ships; \u2022capitalize on the portability and flexibility of our ships by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns, while continuing our focus on existing key markets; \u2022provide extraordinary destination experiences and state-of-the-art port facilities to our guests; \u2022continue to deploy technology capabilities and advanced uses of data and analytics to deliver innovative customer experiences as well as to create operational efficiencies that enhance employee satisfaction; and \u2022maintain strong relationships with travel advisors, while enhancing our consumer outreach and e-commerce programs  Safety, security and health policies We are committed to protecting the health, safety and security of our guests, employees and others working on our behalf. Our efforts in these areas are managed by several departments within the Company that are responsible for maritime safety, global security, environmental stewardship and medical/public health activities. We also have a dedicated committee of our Board of Directors, the Safety, Environment, Sustainability and Health Committee, which is responsible for reviewing and monitoring our overall strategies, policies and programs that impact the safety and health of our guests and crew. Refer to the Regulation - Safety and Security Regulations section below for further information.  Consumer engagement We place a strong focus on identifying the needs of our guests and creating product features and innovations that our customers value. We are focused on targeting and acquiring high-value guests by better understanding consumer data and insights to create communication strategies that resonate with our target audiences.  We target customers at important consumer decision points and identify underlying needs for which guests are willing to pay a premium. We rely on various programs and technologies during the cruise-planning, cruising and after-cruise periods aimed at increasing ticket prices, onboard revenues and occupancy. We have and expect to strategically invest in projects on our ships that we believe drive marketability, profitability and improve the guest experience. 5 5  5   Focus on cost efficiency, capital allocation, adequate cash and liquidity and improving our balance sheet We are focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position and a balanced debt maturity profile, while making progress towards achieving an unsecured balance sheet, obtaining cost efficiencies including lowering interest expense, and reducing leverage. For example, in early 2023, we extended our revolving credit facility with our key relationship banks to ensure adequate liquidity on a going-forward basis. We believe these strategies enhance our ability to achieve our overall goal of maximizing our return on invested capital and long-term shareholder value. Protect the environment  We are focused on the environmental health of the marine environment and communities in which we operate. This includes our Destination Net Zero strategy, and our partnership with the World Wildlife Fund, which together aim to reduce our carbon footprint, raise awareness about ocean conservation among guests and crew, and support ocean conservation projects around the world.  Destination Net Zero is our decarbonization strategy that focuses on how to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and deliver a net zero capable ship by 2035. This strategy also includes achieving reductions on our carbon intensity by double digits by 2025, compared to 2019. Destination Net Zero\u2019s four-pronged approach includes the modernization of our global brands fleet through the introduction of new energy-efficient and alternatively fueled vessels, continued investment in energy efficiency programs, development of alternative fuel and alternative power solutions, and optimized deployment and integration of strategic shore-based supply chains. While we continue to develop our roadmap to Destination Net Zero, it is already clear that our strategy will require new fuels and technologies that are not available today. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - \u201cOur sustainability activities, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, could result in reputational risks, increased costs and other risks\u201d for a discussion of the risks associated with our environmental initiatives.  Our long-term partnership with the World Wildlife Fund focuses on greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") reduction strategies, sustainable sourcing of food supplies, waste management, sustainable destinations and guest education on ocean conservation issues, which supports onboard conservation efforts such as our reduced use of plastics. We are also committed to assessing and managing potential impacts related to our operations in the communities in which we operate.  To achieve our carbon intensity goals, we have invested and plan to continue investing in energy and carbon efficient technologies included in the design of our new vessels, our ongoing fleet energy management program and other technologies. These investments include installation costs related to advanced emissions purification systems (\"AEP\") and other technologies that are expected to reduce fuel consumption and carbon footprint. We believe in transparent reporting on our environmental and sustainability stewardship, as well as our social and governance efforts, and have annually published a Sustainability Report since 2008. This report, the current version of which is accessible on our corporate website, highlights our progress with regards to those environmental, social and governance aspects of our business that we believe are most significant to our organization and stakeholders. In addition to providing an overview on our sustainability efforts, the report references the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative and is aligned with the Sustainable Accounting Standards Boards Industry Standards for Cruise Lines. We continue to work on an initial report following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which we plan to file in 2023. Our corporate website also provides information about our environmental performance goals and sustainability initiatives. The foregoing information contained on our website is not part of any of these reports and is not incorporated by reference herein or in any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Refer to the Regulation - Environmental Regulations section below for further information. Investing in our workforce and promoting equality, diversity and inclusion We believe that our employees, both shipboard and shoreside, are a critical success factor for our business. We strive to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain the best employees, who provide our guests with extraordinary vacations. Our ability to attract, engage, and retain key employees has been and will remain critical to our success. Our Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the Company's human capital management strategies, including initiatives for talent diversity, equity and inclusion, talent management, and corporate culture. We focus on providing our employees with a competitive compensation structure, development opportunities, and other personal and professional growth opportunities in order to strengthen and support our human capital. We also select, develop and have strategies to retain high performing leaders to advance the enterprise now and in the future. To that end, we pay special attention to identifying high performing potential leaders and developing bench strength so these leaders can assume leadership roles throughout the organization. 6 6  6   We strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces collaboration, motivation and innovation, and believe that maintaining a strong employee-focused culture is beneficial to the growth and expansion of our business. We foster diversity and inclusion among our broad employee base. Refer to the Human Capital section below for further information. Global awareness and market penetration  We increase brand awareness and market penetration of our cruise brands in various ways, including the use of communication strategies and marketing campaigns designed to emphasize the qualities of each brand, especially among target groups. Our marketing strategies include the use of travel advisors, traditional media, mobile and digital media as well as social media, influencers and brand websites. Our brands engage past and potential guests by collaborating with travel partners and through call centers, international offices and international representatives. In addition, our Global Brands target repeat guests with exclusive benefits offered through their respective loyalty programs. We sell and market our Global Brands to guests outside of the United States and Canada through the combined efforts of internationally focused internal resources and a network of independent international representatives located throughout the world. While the majority of our guests for our Global Brands come from North America, we also sell and market our cruise brands to guests in countries outside of North America by tailoring itineraries and onboard product offerings to the cultural characteristics and preferences of our international guests. In addition, we explore opportunities that may arise to acquire or develop brands tailored to specific markets.   Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - \u201cConducting business globally results in increased costs and other risks\u201d for a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations. Delivery of state-of-the-art cruise ships, and fleet upgrade and maintenance We place a strong focus on innovation, which we seek to achieve by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our existing fleet, such as large-scale atriums, double hulls for increased safety, and advanced steel structures. We are expanding our innovation efforts to cover multiple fronts, including naval and architectural design, guest facing features, energy efficiency, sustainability, and safety.  We are committed to building state-of-the-art ships at a moderate growth rate and we believe our success in this area provides us with a competitive advantage. Our newer vessels traditionally generate higher revenue yield premiums and are more efficient and environmentally friendly to operate than older vessels. In 2023, we will introduce three new vessels to our fleet, including Royal Caribbean International\u2019s new flagship \u2013 Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Cruises \u2013 Celebrity Ascent, and Silversea Cruises \u2013 Silver Nova. Each of these vessels will represent the latest hardware for their respective brands and both Icon of the Seas and Silver Nova are the first vessels of a new class. For Royal Caribbean International, new features on Icon of the Seas include a dedicated family neighborhood called \u201cSurfside\u201d, a pool deck featuring the largest swimming pool and waterpark at sea, and the \u201cAquadome\u201d showcasing the tallest waterfall at sea in an 82-foot-tall dome. For Celebrity Cruises, Celebrity Ascent will represent an evolution of Celebrity Beyond and will build on the success that the Edge series of ships has brought to market. For Silversea, Silver Nova will be amongst our most environmentally friendly and energy efficient ships to date.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, our Global Brands and Partner Brands have 10 ships on order. Refer to the Operations section below for further information on our ships on order. As we further develop our Newbuild program, we continue to utilize each vessel as an opportunity to pilot new technology towards Destination Net Zero.  In addition, we regularly evaluate opportunities to order new ships, purchase existing ships or sell ships in our current fleet while ensuring that we remain focused on the returns we generate on invested capital and maintaining a high level of discipline on capital spending and operating leverage. Markets and itineraries In an effort to penetrate untapped markets, diversify our consumer base and respond to changing economic and geopolitical market conditions, we continue to seek opportunities to deploy ships to new, and stronger markets and itineraries throughout the world. The portability of our ships allows us to deploy our ships to meet demand within our existing and new cruise markets. We make deployment decisions generally 18 to 28 months in advance, with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio. Additionally, the infrastructure investments we have made to create a flexible global sourcing model have made our brands relevant in a number of markets around the world, which allows us to be opportunistic and source the highest yielding guests for our itineraries. Our ships offer a wide selection of itineraries that call on over 1,000 destinations in over 120 countries, spanning across all seven continents. We are focused on maximizing long-term shareholder returns by operating in established  7 7  7   markets while growing our presence in developing markets. New capacity has allowed our brands to expand into new markets and itineraries in an effort to address changes in market demand. Destination experiences and port facilities In order to provide unique destination experiences to our guests, we have and continue to invest in our private land destinations. In 2018, we announced our Perfect Day Island Collection, an initiative to develop a series of private island destinations around the world. The first island in the collection, Perfect Day at CocoCay, opened in Spring 2019 and includes a wide range of attractions, such as a full water park, zip line course, freshwater pools, helium balloon ride, splash pads and a beach club. In 2023, we plan to expand Perfect Day at CocoCay with the delivery of Hideaway Beach, an elevated, adults-only experience. Additionally, we are planning to introduce a new product, our Royal Beach Club offering, which will offer an exclusive and branded experience at high volume ports. As a result of the operational disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we delayed previously announced Perfect Day site openings and are reassessing their timing as well as the timing of our Royal Beach Club offering portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to develop additional destinations across the globe. In an effort to secure desirable berthing facilities for our ships, and to provide new or enhanced cruise destinations for our guests, we have actively assisted or invested in the development or enhancement of certain port facilities and infrastructure, including mixed-use commercial properties, located in strategic ports of call, and reduction of our environmental impacts. For instance, in November 2022, we opened in Galveston, Texas our new Net Zero homeport cruise terminal, the first cruise terminal facility to generate 100% of its needed energy through on-site solar panels. Generally, we collaborate with local, private or governmental entities by providing management and/or financial assistance and often enter into long-term port usage arrangements. Our participation in these efforts is most often accomplished via investments with the relevant government authority and/or various other strategic partnerships established to develop and/or operate the port facilities, by providing direct development and management expertise or in certain limited circumstances, by providing direct or indirect financial support. In exchange for our involvement, we generally secure preferential berthing rights for our ships.  Technological capabilities  Technology is a pervasive part of virtually every business process we use to support our operating strategies and provide a quality experience to our customers before, during and after their cruise. Technology also plays a critical role in the measures and protocols that we have developed and will continue operating on our cruise ships. For example, through the deployment of our innovative electronic safety drill (\"Muster 2.0\") program, we have added convenience, and improved our guests experience regarding the mandatory safety briefing.  We have continued to integrate digital capabilities into our operations and have increased our focus in bringing in data analytics and artificial intelligence into our processes to provide better insights on how to model our maintenance or operational actions. Also, we continue to develop tools to enhance our guests' digital experience and grow onboard revenue, by making it easier for our guests to plan and maximize their next vacation through our websites and apps. At the same time, we partnered with SpaceX to launch Starlink, the next generation in shipboard connectivity, unlocking an improved guest experience. In concert with our destination focus, our island technology solutions are now enabling our guests to remain connected with WiFi access, order food and beverages as well as take advantage of all the island based activities with the same ease as onboard our ships. Investments in our core platforms, as well as the trade and direct distribution channels, are delivering the benefit of more modernized solutions with scalability and faster self-service response times while also deploying new features such as flight packages and additional promotional offer capabilities. Cyber security and data privacy are an ongoing focus, and we have made and will continue to make investments to protect our customer data, intellectual property and global operations.  Travel advisor support, consumer outreach, and e-commerce  Travel advisors continue to be a significant sourcing channel of revenues for our ships. We believe in the value of this distribution channel and invest in maintaining strong relationships with our travel partners. To accomplish this goal, we seek to maintain competitive commission rates and incentive structures with the marketplace. We continuously work with travel advisors to sell upgrades and add-ons such as air and pre-cruise purchases to improve the retention and profitability  8 8  8   of the channel. We provide brand dedicated sales representatives who serve as consultants to our travel partners. We also provide trained customer service representatives, call centers and online training tools. We continue to operate our Consumer Outreach department, which provides consumers 24-hour access to our vacation planners and customer service agents in our call centers, as well as invest in our websites, including mobile applications and mobile websites. We enable our guests to communicate and book with us through various channels such as phone, web, chat, text message, and/or email. Additionally, we continue to advance our e-commerce capabilities and the vacation shopping experience for our guests. In addition to offering a simplified booking experience, we leverage the mobile application for onboard experiences such as WiFi, beverages, shore excursions, and specialty dining \u2013 enabling guests to book their vacation end-to-end.  Guest Services We offer to handle virtually all travel aspects related to guest reservations and transportation, including facilitating guest pre- and post-hotel stay arrangements and air transportation.  Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises offer recognition and status upgrades to their guests through their loyalty programs, Crown & Anchor Society, Captain\u2019s Club, and Venetian Society, respectively, to encourage repeat business. Crown & Anchor Society has approximately 17.8 million members worldwide. Captain\u2019s Club and Venetian Society have approximately 5.4 million members combined worldwide. Members are awarded points or credits in proportion to the number of cruise days and stateroom category. The loyalty programs provide tiers of membership benefits which entitle guests to upgraded experiences and recognition relative to the status achieved once the guests have accumulated the number of cruise points or credits specified for each tier. In addition, upon achieving a certain level of cruise points or credits, the Crown & Anchor Society and Captain\u2019s Club members benefit from reciprocal membership benefits between the loyalty programs. Examples of the benefits available under our loyalty programs include, but are not limited to, priority ship embarkation, priority waitlist for shore excursions, complimentary laundry service, complimentary internet, digital discount vouchers, upgraded bathroom amenities, private seating on the pool deck, ship tours and, in the case of our most loyal guests who have achieved the highest levels of cruise points or credits, complimentary cruises. We regularly work to enhance each of our loyalty programs by adding new features and amenities in order to reward our repeat guests.   Operations Cruise Ships and Itineraries  As of December\u00a031, 2022, our Global Brands and Partner Brands collectively operated 64 ships with a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations in over 120 countries.

Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal based on the demand for cruises. Demand is typically strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have focused on deployment in the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period. Passengers and Capacity Selected statistical information is shown in the following table (see Financial Presentation- Description of Certain Line Items and Selected Operational and Financial Metrics under Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for definitions). Passengers Carried, Passenger Cruise Days, Available Passenger Cruise Days and Occupancy reflect the impact of our suspension of operations during parts of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the gradual resumption of full operations starting the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022:  Year Ended December\u00a031, (3)20222021 (1)(3)2020 (2)2019 (2)2018 (2)Passengers Carried5,536,3351,030,4031,295,1446,553,8656,084,201Passenger Cruise Days35,051,9355,802,5828,697,89344,803,95341,853,052Available Passenger Cruise Days (APCD)41,197,65011,767,4418,539,90341,432,45138,425,304Occupancy85.1%49.3%101.9%108.1%108.9% ___________________________________________________________________ 12 12  12   (1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Due to the elimination of the Silversea Cruises three-month reporting lag in October of 2021, we include Silversea Cruises' metrics from October 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 and October 1 through December 31, 2021 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The year ended December 31, 2021 does not include July, August, and September 2021 statistics as Silversea Cruises' results of operations for those months are included within Other (expense) income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021.

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we include the full year of operations for Azamara Cruises. Cruise Pricing Our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities, including meals and entertainment. Prices vary depending on many factors including the destination, cruise length, stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place.  Although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the United States, our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the sailing. Our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often more than two years in advance of sailing. During the selling period of a cruise, we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand, with the objective of maximizing net yields.  As our business has grown globally, our sale arrangements with travel advisors may vary. For instance, although our direct business has historically grown at a rapid pace, sale arrangements through travel advisor charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the China market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales. We have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities, making it easier to do business with us. For example, we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world.  Passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 66%, 61% and 68% of total revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Onboard Activities and Other Revenues Our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services, amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship. While many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise, we realize additional revenues from, among other things, gaming, the sale of alcoholic and other beverages, internet and other telecommunication services, gift shop items, shore excursions, photography, spa/salon and fitness services, art auctions, retail shops and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options. Many of these services are available for pre-booking prior to embarkation. These activities are offered either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues. The all-inclusive pricing programs that we offer currently, add some of these onboard activity and other services to the base price of the cruise.  In conjunction with our cruise vacations, we offer pre- and post-cruise hotel packages to our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises guests. We also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets, which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation, medical protection and baggage protection. Onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 34%, 39%, and 32% of total revenues in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  Segment Reporting We believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our Global  13 13  13   Brands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics, types of consumers, regulatory environment, maintenance requirements, supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided. Our President and Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the Company as one segment. (For financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.)  Human Capital Our human capital strategy focuses on attracting, developing and retaining the best talent in the industry. Some key elements of these strategies include: assessing current and future talent needs; a diverse and inclusive workforce; robust opportunities for employee growth and development; support for health and well-being; and an active listening strategy to make sure voices are heard and continuous improvement occurs. We review our human capital metrics and our diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) program with the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2022, our three global cruise brands employed approximately 102,500 employees spanning across our shipboard fleet and shoreside locations. Our shoreside workforce, including private destinations, consisted of approximately 8,100 full time and 100 part-time employees. Our shipboard workforce consisted of 94,300 employees, and as of December 31, 2022, approximately 88% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The following table details the distribution of our workforce by employee type and region as of December 31, 2022: Employee TypeU.S. Based Employees International Employees Shoreside Operations(1)4,1003,000Shipboard Employees \u201494,300Private Destinations (2) \u20141,100 Shoreside Operations(1) Private Destinations (2)   (1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Includes full time and part-time employees.

As a global operation, we take great pride in the broad diversity of our workforce and the value it brings to our company. Our shoreside workforce is gender diverse with 58% female representation. Our shipboard workforce is comprised of employees from approximately 139 countries. The majority of our shipboard workforce comes from the Philippines (30%), Indonesia (18%) and India (14%). Our shoreside workforce is primarily based out of the U.S. (57%), Philippines (21%), Mexico (7%), and U.K. (5%).

We offer a variety of learning and development programs to our workforce, which includes a combination of instructor led (classroom and virtual) and web based (self-learning) courses. In 2022, our workforce invested approximately 2.5 million hours in learning programs across a variety of areas ranging from Ethics, Compliance, Data Analysis, Business Software and Tools, Finance/Accounting, Professional development, Project Management skills, Cyber Security, Leadership and Safety/Security. In total, our workforce completed approximately 1.2 million courses within our learning management systems.  We run our employee pulse surveys periodically to understand and positively impact our employees\u2019 experience. In 2022, our shoreside employee engagement scores remained high and above most global industry benchmarks.  Insurance  We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship. This coverage is maintained with reputable insurance underwriters from the British, Scandinavian, French, United States and other reputable international insurance markets. We are members of four Protection and Indemnity (\"P&I\") clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 12 P&I clubs, known as the International Group of P&I Clubs (the \u201cIG\u201d). Liabilities, costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew, guest injury, pollution and other third-party claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our P&I clubs, subject to the clubs\u2019 rules and the limits of coverage determined by the IG. P&I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 12 P&I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers. We maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, terrorism, rebellion, piracy and hijacking. Our primary war risk coverage is provided by a Norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our four P&I clubs. Consistent with most marine war risk policies, our coverage is subject to cancellation in the event of a change in risk. In the event of a war between major powers, our primary policies terminate after thirty days\u2019 notice and our excess policies terminate immediately. Our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk. These notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk. Insurance coverage for other exposures, such as shoreside property and casualty, passenger off-vessel, directors and officers and network security and privacy, are maintained with various global insurance companies. We do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place, as compared to the cost of insurance. All insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels. In addition, in certain circumstances, we either self-insure or co-insure a portion of these risks. Premiums charged by insurance carriers, including carriers in the maritime insurance industry, increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature. These cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets. We historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable. No assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future, particularly for war risk insurance.  15 15  15    Trademarks We own a number of registered trademarks related to the Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises cruise brands. The registered trademarks include the name \u201cRoyal Caribbean International\u201d and its crown and anchor logo, the name \u201cCelebrity Cruises\u201d and its \u201cX\u201d logo, the name \u201cSilversea Cruises\u201d and its logo, and the names of various cruise ships, ship venues and other marketing programs. We believe our largest brands' trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.  Regulation  Our ships are regulated by various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In addition, our ships are registered in the Bahamas, Cyprus, Malta or in the case of our ships operating in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry, including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships, guests and crew as well as environmental protection. Each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below. Ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations. Additionally, ships operating out of the United States ports are subject to inspection by the United States Coast Guard for compliance with international treaties and by the United States Public Health Service for sanitary and health conditions. Our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit.  We believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business. Health, safety, security, environmental and financial responsibility issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the United States and internationally. From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes may be implemented that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. Safety and Security Regulations Our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (\u201cSOLAS\u201d), which, among other things, establish requirements for ship design, structural features, materials, construction, lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships for guest and crew safety. The SOLAS standards are revised from time to time and incorporated in our ship design and operation, as applicable. The latest enhancements include the addition of the Polar Code which sets goal-based standards for ships operating in the polar region as well as damage stability requirements for new designs and operational measures for existing vessels. Compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs. SOLAS incorporates the International Safety Management Code (\u201cISM Code\u201d), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for all vessels, including passenger vessel operators.  All of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities, and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ISM Code. Additionally, we are required to meet, and we fully comply with, the provisions outlined in the Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). This convention sets the training and competency standards for all our crew who are responsible for operating the vessels or who have designated roles in ensuring the safety of our guests and crew during an emergency. Regulatory bodies routinely check that our crews\u2019 training credentials are up-to-date and assess competency by observing safety and emergency drills. As amendments are made to STCW, we ensure that our crew training is updated accordingly. Our ships are subject to various security requirements, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (\u201cISPS Code\u201d), which is part of SOLAS, and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (\u201cMTSA\u201d), which applies to ships that operate in U.S. ports. In order to satisfy these security requirements, we implement security measures, conduct vessel security assessments, and develop security plans. The security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the Recognized Security Organization on behalf of the ships' flag state and are in compliance with the ISPS Code and the MTSA.  The Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the United States, requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of  16 16  16   practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime. The cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires. Some provisions of the act call for regulations which have not been finalized. We do not expect the pending regulations to have a material impact to our operations. Environmental Regulations We are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under such laws and regulations, we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. From time to time, environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations, which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs. We believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and, accordingly, may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future, including the items described below. Our ships are subject to the International Maritime Organization\u2019s (\u2018\u2018IMO\u2019\u2019) regulations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the \u2018\u2018MARPOL Regulations\u2019\u2019) and the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (Ballast Water Management Convention), in addition to other regional and national regulations such as EU Directives and the US Vessel General Permit, which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil, sewage, garbage, air emissions and the transfer of non-native/non-indigenous species. We have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil, sewage, air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships.  Emissions The MARPOL Regulations imposed reduced global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 0.5% as of January 1, 2020, which was reduced from 3.5%. We do not expect for this increased limitation to have a material impact to our results of operations largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years, including equipping all of our new ships delivered since 2014 with Advanced Emissions Purification (\"AEP\") systems covering all engines and actively developing and installing AEP systems on the majority of our remaining fleet; resulting in 70% of our fleet being equipped with AEP systems. In addition, the majority of our ships on order are being delivered with Liquified Natural Gas (\"LNG\") technology that meet all sulfur requirements. These efforts will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility.  The MARPOL Regulations also establish special Emission Control Areas (\"ECAs\") with additional stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in certain geographical areas. There are four established ECAs and one additional ECA being established beginning in May of 2025 that restrict sulfur emissions: the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, certain waters surrounding the North American coast, and the waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the \"Caribbean ECA\") and the Mediterranean Sea. Ships operating in these sulfur ECAs are required to reduce their emissions sulfur content to 0.1%. This reduction has not, and with the addition of the new ECA will not, have a significant impact on our results of operations to date due to the mitigating steps described above.  Additionally, all new ships operating within the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA that began construction on or after January 1, 2016, and North and Baltic Sea ships constructed on or after January 1, 2021 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits. We comply with these rules for those relevant ships in service. As an added measure, all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with these rules. The rules have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact to our operations or costs.  Beginning in 2018 and 2019, respectively, the European Union (EU) and IMO both implemented requirements for ships to monitor and report their carbon emissions. Compliance with these regulations have not materially impacted our costs or results of operations. However, the legislations contemplate the enactment of further obligations and restrictions focused on reducing carbon emissions from ships. The EU has proposed a series of significant carbon reforms under its Fit for 55 package designed to meet its 2030 emission goals, which would require us, among other things, to increase the use of low carbon fuel onboard our vessels, connectivity to shore power, and to purchase carbon allowances. The Fit for 55 Package includes proposals for the EU Emission Trading System (ETS), and the FuelEU Maritime initiative. The ETS\u2019s current proposed structure will subject ship operators to the program, and will impose requirements to purchase carbon emission allowances beginning in 2024 for 40% of our emissions within Europe, growing to 70% in 2025, and to 100% by 2026. The FuelEU Maritime initiative, still under development, currently proposes requirements on fuel mix of 2-6% lower carbon fuels beginning in 2024 to 2026 and connecting to shore power by 2030. If enacted, the Fit for 55 proposals could individually and collectively have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to increased costs  17 17  17   associated with compliance and modified itineraries in the affected regions. The impact of the regulation is uncertain as elements of the proposals have not been finalized and the costs of ETS allowances will depend on future markets. In November of 2020, IMO approved amendments to the MARPOL convention that will require ships, beginning in 2023, to combine a technical and an operational approach (Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (\"EEXI\") and Carbon Intensity Indicator (\"CII\")) to reduce their carbon intensity in line with the ambition of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, which aims to reduce carbon intensity of international shipping by 40% by 2030 as compared to 2008. The approved framework for the EEXI and CII amendments are not expected to have a material impact on our operations, however IMO is expected to review the CII framework in 2026, which could result in further requirements which could lead to changes to our itinerary flexibility for some of our ships depending on the final operational measures needed to comply. Furthermore, the IMO is also considering various other measures, including a possible fuel standard or a global market-based measures, such as carbon taxes, that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions even further. While the exact impact is uncertain at this time as the proposals have yet to be finalized, the global nature of the regulation could result in increased compliance costs. We will continue to monitor and be engaged in the discussions.  Ballast Water The IMO Ballast Water Management Convention, which came into effect in 2017, requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing Ballast Water Treatment Systems by 2023. Compliance with this regulation has not had a material effect on our results of operations and we do not expect the continuing compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations.  Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Environmental, labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase costs\" for further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above.  Consumer Financial Responsibility Regulations  We are required to obtain certificates from the United States Federal Maritime Commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of non-performance of obligations to guests, as well as casualty and personal injury. As a condition to obtaining the required certificates, we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our ship-operating companies. The required amount of the surety bonds for non-performance of obligations to guests is currently $32 million per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments.  We are also required by the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the non-performance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom we are currently required by the Association of British Travel Agents to provide performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year, up to \u00a3154 million during the peak season. Additionally, we are required by the Civil Aviation Authority to provide performance bonds totaling \u00a335 million. We maintain with the Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Baltics. Certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the non-performance of our obligations; however, the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs.   Taxation of the Company The following is a summary of our principal taxes, exemptions and special regimes. In addition to or instead of income taxation, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee, or both, based on guest headcount, tonnage or some other measure. We also collect and remit value added tax (VAT) or sales tax in many jurisdictions where we operate. Our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation.  U.S. Income Taxation  The following is a discussion of the application of the U.S. federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, court decisions and the relevant state tax laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations. All of the foregoing is subject to change, and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion. 18 18  18   Application of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises, Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and many of our ship-owning subsidiaries, depending upon the itineraries of their ships, receive income from sources within the United States. Silversea Cruises Ltd. and our United Kingdom tonnage tax company are classified as disregarded entities, or divisions for U.S. federal income tax purposes that may earn U.S. source income. Under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income (and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits) U.S. source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, including income from the leasing of such ships.  A foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (1) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States; and (2) the stock of the corporation (or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof) is \u201cprimarily and regularly traded on an established securities market\u201d in the United States. In the opinion of our U.S. tax counsel, Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., including Silversea Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and relevant ship-owning subsidiaries with U.S. source shipping income qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in Liberia, which is a qualifying country, and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States (i.e., we are a \u201cpublicly traded\u201d corporation). If, in the future, (1) Liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction, and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption, or (2) we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation, we and all of our ship-owning or operating subsidiaries that rely on Section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their U.S. source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto.  We believe that most of our income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and, therefore, is exempt from taxation under Section 883.  Regulations under Section 883 list activities that are not considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation, shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise tours. Our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the United States will be subject to U.S. taxation. Taxation in the Absence of an Exemption Under Section 883  If Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the operator of our vessels, Celebrity Cruises Inc., or our ship-owning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, or if the provision was repealed, then, as explained below, such companies would be subject to U.S. income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships. Because Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Celebrity Cruises Inc. conduct a trade or business in the United States, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., including Silversea Cruises Ltd., and Celebrity Cruises Inc. would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income (i.e., without regard to the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries) on income which is effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business (generally only income from U.S. sources). In addition, if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business were withdrawn, or were deemed to have been withdrawn, from our U.S. trade or business, those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a \u201cbranch profits\u201d tax at the rate of 30%. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which includes Silversea Cruises Ltd. for tax purposes, and Celebrity Cruises Inc. would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30%. If Section 883 were not available to our ship-owning subsidiaries, each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4% tax on its U.S. source gross transportation income, if any, each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the United States and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship. Other United States Taxation Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which includes Silversea Cruises Ltd., and Celebrity Cruises Inc. earn U.S. source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping. The tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented.    19 19  19   State Taxation Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state\u2019s portion of the U.S. source income subject to federal income taxes. Additionally, the state of Alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in Alaska and certain other affiliated companies to Alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33% tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in Alaska waters. This did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented. United Kingdom Income Taxation During the year ended December 31, 2022, we operated 15 ships under the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime (\u201cU.K. tonnage tax\u201d). Companies subject to U.K. tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels. The requirements for a company to qualify for the U.K. tonnage tax regime include being subject to U.K. corporate income tax, operating qualifying ships, which are strategically and commercially managed in the United Kingdom, and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement. Relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities. Our U.K. income from non-shipping activities which do not qualify under the U.K. tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant, remain subject to regular U.K. corporate income tax.  Other Taxation We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to value-added and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable, zero-rated or exempt.  In December 2022, the European Union announced it would implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation Development\u2019s (OECD\u2019s) 15% Global Minimum Tax initiative (known as \u201cPillar 2\u201d). If enacted, these rules generally impose a 15% corporate minimum tax on large multi-national companies, and we expect to be in scope of the rules beginning in 2025. The OECD model rules provide an exclusion for \u201cInternational Shipping Income,\u201d and certain ancillary income, for which certain of our earnings may be eligible. We are still pending final guidance on several material open technical issues and assessing the impact on our financial statements.
