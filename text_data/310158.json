{"cik": 310158, "item_1A": "Item 1.Business. Merck\u00a0& Co., Inc. (Merck or the Company) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, including biologic therapies, vaccines and animal health products. The Company\u2019s operations are principally managed on a product basis and include two operating segments, Pharmaceutical and Animal Health, both of which are reportable segments. The Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. The Company sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. The Company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products. The Company sells its products to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.  On June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off (the Spin-Off) of products from its women\u2019s health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent, publicly traded company named Organon & Co. (Organon) through a distribution of Organon\u2019s publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. The established brands included in the transaction consisted of dermatology, non-opioid pain management, respiratory, select cardiovascular products, as well as the rest of Merck\u2019s diversified brands franchise.

Competition and the Health Care Environment Competition The markets in which the Company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. The Company\u2019s competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug manufacturers, and animal health care companies. The Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the Company\u2019s products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors\u2019 branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products. Pharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. The Company is active in acquiring and  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents marketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales for the Company\u2019s products in that therapeutic category. The highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company\u2019s products as well as competitors\u2019 products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors. Health Care Environment and Government Regulation Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform enacted in prior years, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company\u2019s sales performance in 2022 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. In the U.S., the Biden Administration and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect sales and profits. United States The Company faces increasing pricing pressure from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company\u2019s sales and profit margins, including, through (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (American Rescue Plan Act), and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Inflation Reduction Act). In the U.S., federal and state governments for many years have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal and state laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for medicines purchased by certain state and federal entities such as the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients. Additionally in the U.S., consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products. Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Merck\u2019s products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been increasing the cost-sharing required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payor has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. As the U.S. payor market concentrates further, the Company may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors. In order to provide information about the Company\u2019s pricing practices, the Company annually posts on its website its Pricing Transparency Report for the U.S. The report provides the Company\u2019s average annual list price, net price increases, and average discounts across the Company\u2019s U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010. In 2022, the Company\u2019s gross U.S. sales were reduced by 39.7% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns.  Legislative Changes In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the Medicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the Medicare Part D program to require manufacturers to bear more of  6 6 6 Table of Contents Table of Contents the liability for certain drug benefits, and government price-setting for certain Medicare Part D drugs, starting in 2026, and Medicare Part B drugs starting in 2028.  The long-term implications of the Inflation Reduction Act remain uncertain and subject to various factors, including the manner in which U.S. Department of Health and Human Services decides to implement the statute. Many experts and analysts, both within the industry and outside, have predicted that the law will harm innovation in the pharmaceutical industry and result in fewer new treatments being developed and approved over time. Merck is working to mitigate the potentially harmful effects that the law could have on innovation.  In addition, in 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which included a provision that eliminates the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. These rebates act as a discount off the list price and eliminating the cap means that manufacturer discounts paid to Medicaid can increase. Prior to this change, manufacturers have not been required to pay more than 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) in rebates to state Medicaid programs for Medicaid-covered drugs. As a result of this provision, beginning in 2024, it is possible that manufacturers may have to pay state Medicaid programs more in rebates than they received on sales of particular products. This change could present a risk to Merck in the future for drugs that have high Medicaid utilization and rebate exposure that is more than 100% of the AMP. The Company also faces increasing pricing pressure in the states, which are looking to exert greater influence over the price of prescription drugs. A number of states have passed pharmaceutical price and cost transparency laws. These laws typically require manufacturers to report certain product price information or other financial data to the state. Some laws also require manufacturers to provide advance notification of price increases. The Company expects that states will continue their focus on pharmaceutical pricing and will increasingly shift to more aggressive price control tools such as Prescription Drug Affordability Boards that have the authority to conduct affordability reviews and establish upper payment limits. Regulatory Changes In November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General issued a Final Rule that would have, effective January 1, 2023, eliminated the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to PBMs on behalf of such plans. Congress has delayed implementation of this Final Rule until January 1, 2026 and pending federal legislation would repeal it entirely. While the Company cannot anticipate the effects of this change to the way it currently contracts, this new framework could significantly alter the way it does business with Part D Plan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans. This rulemaking also established, effective January 1, 2021, a new safe harbor for point of sale discounts at the pharmacy counter and a new safe harbor for certain service arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs.  The pharmaceutical industry also could be considered a potential source of savings via other legislative and administrative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls.  European Union Efforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in the European Union (EU). The Company faces competitive pricing pressure resulting from generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, a majority of countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs. Reference pricing may either compare a product\u2019s prices in other markets (external reference pricing), or compare a product\u2019s price with those of other products in a national class (internal reference pricing). The authorities then use the price data to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including the Company\u2019s drugs. Guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations. Some EU Member States have established free-pricing systems, but regulate the pricing for drugs through profit control plans. Others seek to negotiate or set prices based on the cost-effectiveness of a product or an assessment of whether it offers a therapeutic benefit over other products in the relevant class. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In some EU Member States, cross-border imports from low-priced markets also exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within an EU Member State. Additionally, EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement plans vary widely from Member State to Member State. Some EU Member States provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some EU Member States may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to already available therapies or so-called health technology assessments (HTA), in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The HTA of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents most EU Member States. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, involves the assessment of the cost-effectiveness, public health impact, therapeutic impact and/or the economic and social impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national health care system of the individual country in which it is conducted. Ultimately, HTA measures the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones. The outcome of HTAs regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of the Company\u2019s products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or may force the Company to reduce its reimbursement price or offer discounts or rebates.  A negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body could also undermine the Company\u2019s ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a jurisdiction. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms may rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework, to inform their pricing and reimbursement decisions. HTA procedures require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, the Company may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of the Company\u2019s product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any EU Member State will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of the Company\u2019s products, or that it will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required. Japan In Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricings for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules. In addition, if a Merck product has the same medical action or composition of another product that is subject to market expansion re-pricing, the Merck product could also be subject to re-pricing unless it meets exception criteria. The next government-mandated price reduction will occur in April 2023. China The Company\u2019s business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to the Company\u2019s overall pharmaceutical and vaccines business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of the Company\u2019s business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the Company\u2019s current in-line products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented a number of structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs. Since 2017, there have been multiple new policies introduced by the government to improve access to new innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings, and accelerate the review and approval process. This has led to a significant increase in the number of new products being approved each year. While the mechanism for drugs being added to the government\u2019s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) evolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands. In 2021, drugs were added to the NRDL with an average of more than 60% price reductions. A new NRDL was recently completed in which new entries averaged 60% price reductions. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volume based procurement (VBP). In 2019, the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation approval. Mature products that have entered into the last five rounds of VBP had, on average, a price reduction of more than 50%. The Company expects VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward. Emerging Markets The Company\u2019s focus on emerging markets, in addition to China, has continued. Governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property, including in exceptional cases, threats of compulsory licenses, that aim to put pressure on the price of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in constrained market access to innovative medicine. The Company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to varying degrees in the emerging markets. Beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in emerging market countries can affect the Company\u2019s efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, changes in trade sanctions and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, credit worthiness of health care partners, such as hospitals, and other  8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the Company. Further, the Company may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the Company\u2019s risk exposure. In addressing global cost containment pressures, the Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens\u2019 access to appropriate health care, including medicines. Operating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company\u2019s business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well-positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces. Regulation The pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world focused on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement. Of particular importance is the FDA in the U.S., which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the U.S. At the same time, the FDA has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d designation, which has accelerated the regulatory review process for medicines with this designation. The FDA has also undertaken efforts to bring generic competition to market more efficiently and in a more timely manner. The EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, approval for marketing, labeling, advertising, manufacturing, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU Member States. In particular, EU regulators may approve products subject to a number of post-authorization conditions. Examples of typical post-authorization commitments include additional pharmacovigilance, the conduct of clinical trials, the establishment of patient registries, physician or patient education and controlled distribution and prescribing arrangements. Non-compliance with post-authorization conditions, pharmacovigilance and other obligations can lead to regulatory action, including the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations, or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including the imposition of financial penalties. The Company\u2019s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company\u2019s business. The Company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment. (See \u201cResearch and Development\u201d below for a discussion of the regulatory approval process.) Access to Medicines As a global health care company, Merck\u2019s primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines. The Company also recognizes that, in collaboration with key stakeholders, it has a role to play in helping to ensure that its science advances health care, and its products are accessible and affordable. The Company is committed to ensuring a reliable, safe global supply of its quality medicines and vaccines, and to developing, testing and implementing innovative solutions that address barriers to access and affordability of its medicines and vaccines. The Company\u2019s approach is designed to enable it to serve the greatest number of patients today, while meeting the needs of patients in the future. The Company\u2019s efforts in this regard are wide-ranging and include a set of principles that the Company strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the Company\u2019s worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. The Company systematically evaluates its pipeline candidates to identify potential to address significant public health burden and unmet medical needs in underserved health care settings. Products continue to be evaluated for their potential throughout their life cycle to account for changes in the external environment. The Company also collaborates with different stakeholders,  9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents including private, governmental, multilateral and non-profit organizations, to design and deliver sustainable solutions to help address access challenges at the payer, provider and patient levels.  In addition, through innovative social investments, including philanthropic programs and impact investing, Merck is helping to strengthen health systems and build capacity, particularly in under-resourced communities. The Merck Patient Assistance Program provides certain medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the U.S. who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the Company\u2019s assistance, cannot afford their Merck medicines and vaccines. Globally, Merck has made substantial contributions to access to health through key initiatives, including product donations for humanitarian assistance in low-income countries through the Medical Outreach Program. The Mectizan Donation Program, the longest running disease-specific drug donation program of its kind, supports the elimination of two neglected tropical diseases \u2013 onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Additionally, through Merck for Mothers the Company provides funding, and scientific and business acumen to help global health partners end preventable deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Merck has also provided funds to the Merck Foundation, an independent grantmaking organization, which supports a variety of organizations dedicated to addressing systemic barriers to health equity.  Privacy and Data Protection The Company is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to transfer, access and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the Company\u2019s business, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes penalties of up to 4% of global revenue.  The GDPR and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States govern the collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU. The GDPR increased responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that the Company processes. It also imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (which includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. Further, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that are not considered by the EC to provide an adequate level of data protection, including to the U.S., except if the data controller meets very specific requirements. Following the Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the EU in 2020, there is considerable uncertainty as to the permissibility of international data transfers under the GDPR. In light of the implications of this decision, the Company may face difficulties regarding the transfer of personal data from the EU to third countries. Since then, the Company diligently entered into the EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses with its vendors, suppliers, collaboration partners and clinical trial sites in order to facilitate the lawful transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. In addition, President Biden issued an Executive Order on October 7, 2022 to address the data privacy concerns raised in the Schrems II decision through introducing, among other measures, further safeguards and oversight of personal data collection by U.S. signals intelligence activities and providing individuals with a redress mechanism in the U.S. for their data protection concerns. Further certainty for the international transfer of personal data from the EU via the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (successor to the invalidated EU-U.S. Privacy Shield) may come by way of a new EU Adequacy Decision, issued in draft form by the EU Commission on December 13, 2022 and expected to come into force in mid-2023. However, it remains likely that such a new Adequacy Decision will be contested by privacy advocates and be subject to legal review. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at both the EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised. There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against the Company, harm to its reputation, and adversely impact its business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents different regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that the Company faces with regard to data protection regulation. In August 2021, China passed the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) that aims to standardize the handling of personal information in China which became effective in November 2021. The PIPL currently applies to the processing of personal information of natural persons in China, the processing of personal information outside China where the purpose is to provide products and services in China, and to analyze the activities of individuals in China. While similar to the GDPR, the PIPL contains unique requirements not found in the GDPR. The Company has developed and implemented comprehensive plans to ensure compliance with the PIPL, with those relating to data localization and cross-border transfers yet to be completed pending forthcoming guidance from the Cyberspace Administration of China. Additional laws and regulations enacted in the U.S. (such as comprehensive data protection acts in California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut), Canada, Europe, Asia, and Latin America, have increased enforcement and litigation activity in the U.S. and other developed markets, as well as increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. The Company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving requirements and risks and to facilitate the transfer of personal information across international borders.  Distribution The Company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, PBMs and other institutions. Human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Company\u2019s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of the Company\u2019s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals and managed care organizations. The Company sells its animal health products to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.  Patents, Trademarks and Licenses Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company\u2019s marketing of its products in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Patents may cover products per se, pharmaceutical formulations, processes for, or intermediates useful in, the manufacture of products, or the uses of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act includes a Pediatric Exclusivity Provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the U.S. for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. Current U.S. patent law provides additional patent term for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review by the FDA. The EU also provides an additional six months of pediatric market exclusivity attached to a product\u2019s Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). Japan provides the additional term for pediatric studies attached to market exclusivity unrelated to patent term.  11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents Patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the Company normally provide market exclusivity. The Company has the following key patent protection in the U.S., the EU, Japan and China (including the potential for patent term extensions (PTE) and SPCs where indicated) for the following marketed products: ProductYear of Expiration (U.S.)Year of Expiration (EU)(1)Year of Expiration (Japan)(2)Year of Expiration (China)JanuviaExpired(3)Expired2025-2026ExpiredJanumetExpired(3)ExpiredN/AExpiredJanumet XRExpired(3)N/AN/AExpiredIsentress202420232023-2026(4)ExpiredSimponiN/A(5)2024(6)N/A(5)N/A(5)Lenvima(7)2025(8)2026(8) (SPCs)2026ExpiredBridion2026(8)20232024ExpiredBravecto2026 (with pending PTE)2025 (patents), 2029 (SPCs)20292025Gardasil2028ExpiredExpiredN/AGardasil 920282025 (patents), 2030(8) (SPCs)N/A2025Keytruda202820312032-20332028Lynparza(9)2028(8) (with pending PTE)2024 (patents), 2029(8) (SPCs)2028-20292024Zerbaxa2028(8)2023 (patents), 2028(8) (SPCs)2028 N/AAdempas(10)N/A(11)2028(8)2027-20282023Belsomra2029N/A2031N/APrevymis2029(8) (with pending PTE)2024 (patents), 2029(8) (SPCs)20292024Verquvo(10)2035 (with pending PTE)N/A(12)N/A(12)N/A(12)Vaxneuvance2031 (with pending PTE)No PatentNo PatentN/ADelstrigo2032 (with pending PTE)2031 (patents), 2033 (SPCs)N/A2031Pifeltro2032 (with pending PTE)2031 (patents), 2033 (SPCs)20362031Recarbrio2033(8) (with pending PTE)2029 (patents), 2034 (SPCs)2034 (with pending PTE)N/AWelireg2035 (with pending PTE)N/AN/AN/A Year of Expiration (EU)(1) Year of Expiration (Japan)(2) Year of Expiration (China) Expired(3) Expired(3) Expired(3) 2023-2026(4) N/A(5) 2024(6) N/A(5) N/A(5) Lenvima(7) 2025(8) 2026(8) (SPCs) 2026(8) Gardasil 9 2025 (patents), 2030(8) (SPCs) Lynparza(9) 2028(8) (with pending PTE) 2024 (patents), 2029(8) (SPCs) 2028(8) 2023 (patents), 2028(8) (SPCs) Adempas(10) N/A(11) 2028(8) 2029(8) (with pending PTE) 2024 (patents), 2029(8) (SPCs) Verquvo(10) N/A(12) N/A(12) N/A(12) Vaxneuvance 2033(8) (with pending PTE) Note:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compound patent unless otherwise noted.\u00a0Certain of the products listed may be the subject of patent litigation.

Unless otherwise noted, the patents in the above charts are compound patents. Each patent may be subject to a future patent term restoration of up to five years and six month pediatric market exclusivity, either or both of which may be available. In addition, depending on the circumstances surrounding any final regulatory approval of the compound, there may be other listed patents or patent applications pending that could have relevance to the product as finally approved; the relevance of any such application would depend upon the claims that ultimately may be granted and the nature of the final regulatory approval of the product. Also, regulatory exclusivity tied to the protection of clinical data is complementary to patent protection and, in some cases, may provide more effective or longer lasting marketing exclusivity than a compound\u2019s patent estate. In the U.S., the data protection generally runs five years from first marketing approval of a new chemical entity, extended to seven years for an orphan drug indication and 12 years from first marketing approval of a biological product. While the expiration of a compound patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product, commercial benefits may continue to be derived from: (i)\u00a0later-expiring patents on processes and intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product; (ii)\u00a0patents relating to the use of such product; (iii)\u00a0patents relating to novel compositions and formulations; and (iv)\u00a0in the U.S. and certain other countries, market exclusivity that may be available under relevant law. The effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and regulations in other countries. Additions to market exclusivity are sought in the U.S. and other countries through all relevant laws, including laws increasing patent life. Some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by an increase in the number of incentives for and use of generic products. Additionally, improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the U.S. and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation of international treaties. For further information with respect to the Company\u2019s patents, see Item\u00a01A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and Item\u00a08. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note\u00a011. \u201cContingencies and Environmental Liabilities\u201d below. Worldwide, all of the Company\u2019s important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely. Royalty income in 2022 on patent and know-how licenses and other rights amounted to $537 million. Merck also incurred royalty expenses amounting to $3.0 billion in 2022 under patent and know-how licenses it holds. 13 13 13  Table of Contents Table of Contents Research and Development The Company\u2019s business is characterized by the introduction of new products or new uses for existing products through a strong research and development program. At December 31, 2022, approximately 19,200 people were employed in the Company\u2019s research activities. The Company prioritizes its research and development efforts and focuses on candidates that it believes represent breakthrough science for unmet medical needs that will make a difference for patients and payers. The Company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. The Company\u2019s research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the Company\u2019s research and development resources on candidates the Company believes are capable of providing unambiguous, promotable advantages to patients and payers and delivering the maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. Merck is pursuing emerging product opportunities independent of therapeutic area or modality (small molecule, biologics and vaccines) and is building its biologics capabilities. The Company is committed to ensuring that externally sourced programs remain an important component of its pipeline strategy, with a focus on supplementing its internal research through acquisitions as well as a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as access to new technologies. The Company\u2019s clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, neurosciences, respiratory diseases, and vaccines. In the development of human health products, industry practice and government regulations in the U.S. and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. Before a new drug or vaccine may be marketed in the U.S., recorded data on preclinical and clinical experience are included in the New Drug Application (NDA) for a drug or the Biologics License Application (BLA) for a vaccine or biologic submitted to the FDA for the required approval. Once the Company\u2019s scientists discover a new small molecule compound or biologic that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition, the Company commences preclinical testing with that compound. Preclinical testing includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry, pharmacology, immunogenicity and toxicology. Pending acceptable preclinical data, the Company will initiate clinical testing in accordance with established regulatory requirements. The clinical testing begins with Phase 1 studies, which are designed to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans. If favorable, additional, larger Phase\u00a02 studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population, define appropriate dosing for the compound, as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound\u2019s usefulness. In some situations, the clinical program incorporates adaptive design methodology to use accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of the ongoing clinical study as it continues, without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. One type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2a/2b trial design, a two-stage trial design consisting of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept stage and a Phase 2b dose-optimization finding stage. If data from the Phase\u00a02 trials are satisfactory, the Company commences large-scale Phase\u00a03 trials to confirm the compound\u2019s efficacy and safety. Another type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design, a study that includes an interim analysis and an adaptation that changes the trial from having features common in a Phase 2 study (e.g., multiple dose groups) to a design similar to a Phase 3 trial. An adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design reduces timelines by eliminating activities which would be required to start a separate study. Upon completion of Phase 3 trials, if satisfactory, the Company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing. There can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed. Vaccine development follows the same general pathway as for drugs. Preclinical testing focuses on the vaccine\u2019s safety and ability to elicit a protective immune response (immunogenicity). Pre-marketing vaccine clinical trials are typically done in three phases. Initial Phase 1 clinical studies are conducted in normal subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate. Phase\u00a02 studies are dose-ranging studies and provide additional data on safety, immunogenicity and/or effectiveness. Finally, Phase\u00a03 trials are conducted in the intended population for licensure and provide data on immunogenicity and/or effectiveness, as well as safety, to support applications for regulatory approvals. If successful, the Company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies. In the U.S., the FDA review process begins once a complete NDA or BLA is submitted, received and accepted for review by the agency. Within 60 days after receipt, the FDA determines if the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA also assesses, at that time, whether the application will be granted  14 14 14 Table of Contents Table of Contents a priority review or standard review. Pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act V (PDUFA), the FDA review period target for NDAs or original BLAs is either six months, for priority review, or ten months, for a standard review, from the time the application is deemed sufficiently complete. Once the review timelines are determined, the FDA will generally act upon the application within those timelines, unless a major amendment has been submitted (either at the Company\u2019s own initiative or the FDA\u2019s request) to the pending application. If this occurs, the FDA may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information, but by no more than three months. Extensions to the review period are communicated to the Company. The FDA can act on an application either by issuing an approval letter or by issuing a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating that the application will not be approved in its present form and describing all deficiencies that the FDA has identified. Should the Company wish to pursue an application after receiving a CRL, it can resubmit the application with information that addresses the questions or issues identified by the FDA in order to support approval. Resubmissions are subject to review period targets, which vary depending on the underlying submission type and the content of the resubmission. The FDA has four program designations \u2014 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review \u2014 to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The Fast Track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA reviewers during the product\u2019s development and the ability for the manufacturer to do a rolling submission of the NDA/BLA. A rolling submission allows completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. The Breakthrough Therapy designation provides manufacturers with all of the features of the Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced staff in the review. The Accelerated Approval designation allows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product\u2019s clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer to conduct required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. The Priority Review designation means that the FDA\u2019s goal is to take action on the NDA/BLA within six months, compared to ten months under standard review. More than one of these special designations can be granted for a given application (i.e., a product designated as a Breakthrough Therapy may also be eligible for Priority Review). Due to the COVID-19 public health crisis, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services has exercised statutory authority to determine that a public health emergency exists, and declared these circumstances justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products as authorized by the FDA. While in effect, this declaration enables the FDA to issue Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) permitting distribution and use of specific medical products absent NDA/BLA submission or approval, including products to treat or prevent diseases or conditions caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, subject to the terms of any such EUAs. The FDA must make certain findings to grant an EUA, including that it is reasonable to believe based on the totality of evidence that the drug or biologic may be effective, and that known or potential benefits when used under the terms of the EUA outweigh known or potential risks. Additionally, the FDA must find that there is no adequate, approved and available alternative to the emergency use of the authorized drug or biologic. The FDA may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. The primary method the Company uses to obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products in the EU is through the \u201ccentralized procedure.\u201d This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and is also available for certain new chemical compounds and products. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies the MAA. It is also possible for new chemical products to obtain marketing authorization in the EU through a \u201cmutual recognition procedure\u201d in which an application is made to a single member state and, if the member state approves the pharmaceutical product under a national procedure, the applicant may submit that approval to the mutual recognition procedure of some or all other EU Member States. Outside of the U.S. and the EU, the Company submits marketing applications to national regulatory authorities. Examples of such are the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan, the National Medical Products Administration in China, Health Canada, Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Vigil\u00e2ncia Sanat\u00e1ria in Brazil, Korea Food and Drug Administration in South Korea, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia. Each country has a separate and independent review process and timeline. In many markets, approval times can be longer as the regulatory authority requires approval in a major market, such as the U.S. or the EU, and issuance of a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product from that market before initiating their local review process. 15 15 15 Table of Contents Table of Contents Research and Development Update The Company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the U.S. and internationally or in late-stage clinical development. MK-4482, Lagevrio, is an investigational oral antiviral medicine for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at risk for progressing to severe disease. Merck is developing Lagevrio in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP (Ridgeback). The FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Lagevrio in December 2021; last issued in February 2023, to authorize Lagevrio for the treatment of adults with a current diagnosis of mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by the FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate. The authorization is based on the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial. Lagevrio is not approved for any use in the U.S. and is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of its emergency use under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. In November 2021, the EMA issued a positive scientific opinion for Lagevrio, which is intended to support national decision-making on the possible use of Lagevrio prior to marketing authorization. In October 2021, the EMA initiated a rolling review for Lagevrio for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. On February 24, 2023, Merck and Ridgeback announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA has recommended the refusal of the marketing authorization for Lagevrio. Merck and Ridgeback will appeal the decision and request a re-examination of the CHMP\u2019s opinion. Applications to other regulatory bodies worldwide are underway.  In October 2022, Merck provided an update on new clinical and non-clinical studies of Lagevrio. A preliminary analysis of the University of Oxford\u2019s PANORAMIC study, conducted in the UK in highly-vaccinated adults mostly over 65 years of age, showed no evidence of a difference between Lagevrio added to usual care compared to usual care alone for the reduction of hospitalizations and deaths through Day 28 (primary endpoint was not met); the incidence of hospitalizations and death through Day 28 was very low overall. The main secondary endpoint (time to first self-reported recovery) in the PANORAMIC study was 6 days shorter with the Lagevrio group compared to the usual care group; in addition, the use of Lagevrio also was associated with earlier recovery across a wide range of other symptom measures, as compared to the usual care group. Additionally, an analysis of real-world data from a separate study conducted by investigators in Israel (known as the Clalit study) showed that in a cohort of non-hospitalized, high-risk patients, Lagevrio reduced hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 in patients 65 years and above; no evidence of benefit was found in younger adults ages 40 to 64 years. Also, Merck reported results from a separate, non-clinical 6-month carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice, which demonstrated that Lagevrio was not carcinogenic at any dose tested. MK-7264, gefapixant, is an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough in adults under review by the FDA and the EMA. The marketing applications for gefapixant are based on results from the COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 clinical trials. In January 2022, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding Merck\u2019s NDA for gefapixant. In the CRL, the FDA requested additional information related to the cough counting system that was used to assess efficacy. The CRL was not related to the safety of gefapixant. The Company is performing additional analyses and anticipates submitting this information to the FDA in the first half of 2023 in response to the CRL. The review period in the EU has been extended pending the receipt of additional information from the Company. Merck plans to submit the information to the EMA in the first half of 2023. MK-3475, Keytruda, is an anti-PD-1 therapy approved for the treatment of many cancers that is in clinical development for expanded indications. These approvals were the result of a broad clinical development program that currently consists of more than 1,650 clinical trials, including more than 1,200 trials that combine Keytruda with other cancer treatments. These studies encompass more than 30 cancer types including: biliary, estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, cervical, colorectal, cutaneous squamous cell, endometrial, esophageal, gastric, glioblastoma, head and neck, hepatocellular, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, non-small-cell lung, small-cell lung, melanoma, mesothelioma, ovarian, prostate, renal, triple-negative breast, and urothelial, many of which are currently in Phase 3 clinical development. Further trials are being planned for other cancers. Keytruda is under review by the FDA for the treatment of patients with previously treated advanced HCC. This submission is based on data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-394 trial along with supportive data from the KEYNOTE-240 and KEYNOTE-224 trials. Keytruda is approved for this indication in the U.S. under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval process. This submission is to convert the accelerated approval to full (regular) approval. Keytruda is under priority review by the FDA for use in combination with Padcev (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) for the treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The FDA set a PDUFA date of April 21, 2023 for the supplemental BLAs  16 16 16 Table of Contents Table of Contents for Keytruda and Pedcev. The combination regimen was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA in February 2020. The applications are supported by efficacy and safety data from the Phase 1b/2 EV-103 trial (also known as KEYNOTE-869) Dose Escalation/Cohort A and Cohort K. Results from Dose Escalation/Cohort A were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Results from Cohort K were presented in a late-breaking session at the 2022 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress. Keytruda is also under review by the FDA for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. This submission is based on data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-913 trial. Keytruda is approved for this indication in the U.S. under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval process. This submission is to convert the accelerated approval to full (regular) approval. Additionally, Keytruda is under review by the FDA for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This submission is based on data from the Phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 trial along with supportive data from the KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-051 trials. Keytruda is approved for this indication in the U.S. under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval process. This submission is to convert the accelerated approval to full (regular) approval. Keytruda is under review in the EU for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage IB (\u22654 cm), II or IIIA NSCLC following complete surgical resection. The submission is based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-091 trial, also known as EORTC-1416-LCG/ETOP-8-15 \u2013 PEARLS. Keytruda is under review in Japan for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory PMBLC. This submission is based on data from the Phase 2 KEYNOTE-170 study and the Phase 1 KEYNOTE-A33 study.  In January 2023, Merck announced that it will stop the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-991 trial investigating Keytruda in combination with enzalutamide and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Merck is discontinuing the study based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) which reviewed data from a planned interim analysis. At the interim analysis, Keytruda in combination with enzalutamide and ADT did not demonstrate an improvement in overall survival or radiographic progression-free survival, the trial\u2019s dual primary endpoints, compared to placebo plus enzalutamide and ADT. Data from this study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. MK-7339, Lynparza, is an oral PARP inhibitor currently approved for certain types of advanced or recurrent ovarian, early or metastatic breast, metastatic pancreatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers being co-developed for multiple cancer types as part of a collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC.  In August 2022, the FDA granted priority review for a supplemental NDA for Lynparza in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC. The supplemental NDA was based on results from the Phase 3 PROpel trial, which were presented at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium and later published in NEJM Evidence. The FDA initially set a PDUFA date in the fourth quarter of 2022, but in December 2022 the FDA extended the PDUFA date by three months to provide further time for the full review of the submission. Lynparza is also under review in Japan for the treatment of certain patients with mCRPC based on the PROpel trial. MK-7902, Lenvima, is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed as part of a collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai). Merck and Eisai are studying the Keytruda plus Lenvima combination through the LEAP (LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab) clinical program that includes studies across 13 different tumor types (biliary cancer, CRC, endometrial carcinoma, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, HCC, HNSCC, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, NSCLC, small-cell-lung cancer (SCLC) and RCC). The Company also has several other programs in Phase 3 clinical development. MK-1308A is the coformulation of quavonlimab, Merck\u2019s novel investigational anti-CTLA-4 antibody, with pembrolizumab being evaluated for the treatment of RCC.  Subcutaneous MK-3475, pembrolizumab, is being evaluated for comparability with the intravenous formulation of pembrolizumab in NSCLC. Subcutaneous MK-3475A, the coformulation of pembrolizumab with hyaluronidase, is being evaluated for comparability with the intravenous formulation of pembrolizumab in NSCLC. MK-4280A is the coformulation of favezelimab, Merck\u2019s novel investigational anti-LAG3 therapy, with pembrolizumab, being evaluated for the treatment of CRC and hematological malignancies. 17 17 17 Table of Contents Table of Contents MK-6482, Welireg (belzutifan), is a hypoxia-inducible factor-2\u03b1 (HIF-2\u03b1) inhibitor being evaluated for a supplemental indication for the treatment of patients with RCC.  MK-7119, Tukysa (tucatinib), is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of HER2-positive cancers in development for the treatment of breast cancer and colorectal cancer. In September 2020, Seagen granted Merck an exclusive license and entered into a co-development agreement with Merck to accelerate the global reach of Tukysa.  MK-7684A is the coformulation of vibostolimab, an anti-TIGIT therapy, with pembrolizumab being evaluated for the treatment of melanoma, NSCLC and SCLC. In December 2021, Merck announced that the FDA had placed clinical holds on the investigational new drug applications for islatravir (MK-8591) programs that were in development for the treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection. The FDA\u2019s clinical hold was based on observations of decreases in total lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell counts in some participants receiving islatravir in clinical studies. In September 2022, Merck announced it will initiate a new doravirine/islatravir (MK-8591A) Phase 3 clinical program for the treatment of people with HIV-1 infection. These new Phase 3 studies will evaluate a once-daily oral combination of doravirine 100 mg and a lower dose of islatravir in previously untreated adults and as a switch in antiretroviral therapy in virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection. The Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating an investigational oral once-weekly combination treatment regimen of islatravir and Gilead Sciences\u2019 lenacapavir in adults with HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed will resume under an amended protocol with a lower dose of islatravir. The investigational NDA for the islatravir + lenacapavir once-weekly treatment regimen remains under a partial clinical hold for any studies that would use weekly oral islatravir doses higher than the doses considered for the revised clinical program. Additionally, Merck announced it will discontinue the development of once-monthly oral islatravir for PrEP. The Company remains committed to developing compounds for long-acting HIV prevention and believes in the potential of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI) mechanism. A Phase 1b study in adults with HIV-1 infection assessing MK-8527, a novel NRTTI candidate, will commence shortly.  V116 is an investigational 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) for treatment of pneumococcal infection in adults. In June 2022, Merck announced the presentation of positive results from a Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of V116 in pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults 18-49 years of age (Phase 1) and 50 years of age and older (Phase 2). In both populations, V116 met the primary immunogenicity objectives and was well-tolerated with an overall safety profile generally comparable to Pneumovax 23 across age groups. In April 2022, Merck announced that V116 received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 6A/C, 7F, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15A, 15B/C, 16F, 17F, 19A, 20, 22F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31, 33F, 35B in adults 18 years of age and older. Phase 3 trials evaluating V116 are ongoing. MK-7962, sotatercept, is an investigational activin receptor type IIA-Fc fusion protein being evaluated as an add-on to stable background therapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Sotatercept was obtained in connection with Merck\u2019s acquisition of Acceleron Pharma Inc. in 2021. In October 2022, Merck announced positive top-line results from the pivotal Phase 3 STELLAR trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of sotatercept for the treatment of PAH (World Health Organization [WHO] Group 1). The trial met its primary efficacy outcome measure, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD, which measures how far patients can walk in 6 minutes). Eight of nine secondary efficacy outcome measures achieved statistical significance, including the outcome measure of proportion of participants achieving multicomponent improvement (defined as improvement in 6MWD, improvement in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, and either improvement in WHO Functional Class [FC] or maintenance of WHO FC II), and the outcome measure of time to death or the first occurrence of a clinical worsening event. The Cognitive/Emotional Impacts domain score of PAH-SYMPACT, which was assessed as the ninth and final secondary outcome measure, did not achieve statistical significance. Results will be presented at the upcoming American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session. The Company anticipates filing sotatercept with regulatory authorities in 2023. MK-1654, clesrovimab, is a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) monoclonal antibody that is being evaluated for the prevention of RSV medically attended lower respiratory tract infection in infants and certain children over 1 year of age. Two Phase 3 trials are currently enrolling. In October 2022, Merck and Royalty Pharma plc (Royalty Pharma) entered into a funding arrangement under which Royalty Pharma paid Merck $50\u00a0million to co-fund Merck\u2019s development costs for a Phase 2b trial of MK-8189, an investigational oral phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitor, which is being evaluated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Under the agreement, Royalty Pharma has no rights to MK-8189 and has no decision-making authority over the program. If Merck elects to advance MK-8189 into a Phase 3 study, Royalty Pharma has the option to provide additional funding of 50% of the development costs up to $375\u00a0million for the Phase 3 trial. If  18 18 18 Table of Contents Table of Contents such additional funding is provided, Royalty Pharma becomes eligible to receive future regulatory milestone payments contingent upon certain marketing approvals, as well as royalties. The charts below reflect the Company\u2019s research pipeline as of February\u00a017, 2023. Candidates shown in Phase\u00a03 include the date such candidate entered into Phase 3 development. Candidates shown in Phase\u00a02 include the most advanced compound with a specific mechanism or, if listed compounds have the same mechanism, they are each currently intended for commercialization in a given therapeutic area. Small molecules and biologics are given MK-number designations and vaccine candidates are given V-number designations. Except as otherwise noted, candidates in Phase\u00a01, additional indications in the same therapeutic area (other than with respect to cancer) and additional claims, line extensions or formulations for in-line products are not shown.

Global Diversity and Inclusion  Diversity and inclusion are fundamental to the Company\u2019s success and core to future innovation. The Company fosters a globally diverse and inclusive workforce for its employees by creating an environment of belonging, engagement, equity, and empowerment. The Company is proactive and intentional about diversity hiring and development programs to advance talent. The Company creates competitive advantages by leveraging diversity and inclusion to accelerate business performance. This includes fostering global supplier diversity, integrating diversity and inclusion into the Company\u2019s commercialization strategies and leveraging employee insights to improve performance. In addition to these efforts, the Company has ten Employee Business Resource Groups that provide opportunities for employees to take an active part in contributing to the Company\u2019s inclusive culture through their work in talent acquisition and development, business and customer insights and social and community outreach. The Company\u2019s diversity goals include increasing representation in senior management roles (defined as an individual holding either a Vice President or Senior Vice President title) by 2024 of (i) women globally to 40%, up from 31% in 2020, (ii) Black/African Americans in the U.S. to 10%, up from 3% in 2020, and (iii) Hispanics/Latinos in the U.S. to 10%, up from 5% in 2020.

Compensation and Benefits The Company provides a valuable suite of compensation and benefits programs that reflect its commitment to attract, retain and motivate its talent, and support its employees and their families in every stage of life. The Company continuously monitors and adjusts its compensation and benefit programs to ensure they are competitive, contemporary, helpful and engaging, and that they support strategic imperatives such as diversity and inclusion, equity, flexibility, quality, security and affordability. For example, the Company regularly monitors and evaluates its pay practices and policies to ensure that it is paying employees equitably across all genders, races and ethnicities. The Company offers a personal health care concierge service to assist U.S. employees participating in the Company medical plan with their health care needs. Aligned with its business and in support of its cancer care strategy, the Company provides enhanced cancer screening benefits with cash incentives, immediate access to a leading cancer center of excellence for U.S. employees and high value cancer support resources (e.g., caregiving and mental health) for employees and their families. Globally, the Company implemented a minimum standard of 12 weeks of paid parental leave, which inclusively applies to all parents. In the U.S., the Company\u2019s benefits rank in the top quartile of Fortune 100 companies under the Aon 2022 Benefits Index. The Company has been included in the  21 21 21 Table of Contents Table of Contents Seramount (previously the Working Mother) 100 Best Companies ranking for 36 consecutive years and was named a top ten Best Company for Moms in 2022.  Employee Well-being The Company is committed to helping its employees and their families improve their own health and well-being, whether physical, mental, financial, or social. The Company\u2019s programs ensure quality, competitive value, protection from significant financial hardship and access to tools and resources to support employees and their families in all stages of their career and their lives, winning the Company awards such as the Best Employers Excellence in Health & Well-being from the Business Group on Health 2022. The Company fosters an array of flexible work arrangements that includes flextime, summer hours, remote work, telework, job sharing and part-time work to help employees succeed personally as well as professionally. As part of the Company\u2019s overall culture of well-being, it also offers onsite services so employees can thrive. For example, in the U.S., these include onsite health care professionals at many major sites, cafeterias committed to healthy menu offerings, onsite childcare, onsite gyms, and the convenient option to bank through its two employee credit unions. COVID-19 Response The Company recognizes that it has a unique responsibility to help in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and is committed to supporting and protecting its employees and their families, ensuring that its supply of medicines and vaccines reaches its patients, contributing its scientific expertise to the development of antiviral approaches and supporting its health care providers and the communities in which they serve. The Company continues to provide employees with easy and regular access to information, including guidance around hygiene measures and travel and how to best collaborate via the Company\u2019s hybrid work model. Examples of pandemic support resources and programs available to the Company\u2019s employees include pay continuation for workers who have been sick or exposed, an updated policy that enables employees with medical backgrounds to volunteer in SARS-CoV-2-related activities, resources to prioritize physical and mental wellness, adjustments to medical plans to cover 100% of a COVID-19-related diagnosis, testing and treatment, childcare resources and more. Engaging Employees The Company strives to foster employee engagement by promoting a safe, positive, diverse, and inclusive work environment that provides numerous opportunities for two-way communication with employees. Some of the Company\u2019s key programs and initiatives include promoting global employee engagement surveys, ongoing pulse checks to the organization for interim feedback on specific topics, fostering professional networking and collaboration, identifying and providing opportunities for volunteering and establishing positive, cooperative business relations with designated employee representatives.  Talent Management and Development As the Company pursues its goal of becoming the world\u2019s premier research-based biopharmaceutical company, there is a consistent focus on the importance of continuously developing its diverse and talented people. The Company is committed to talent growth for all, allowing its employees to move more fluidly across the organization, unlocking an environment that allows them to shape their career pathways via non-linear and inclusive opportunities and experience. Merck\u2019s current talent management system supports company-wide performance management, leadership development, talent reviews and succession planning. Annual performance reviews help further the professional development of the Company\u2019s employees and ensure that the Company\u2019s workforce is aligned with the Company\u2019s objectives. The Company seeks to continuously build the skills and capabilities of its workforce to accelerate talent, improve performance and mitigate risk through relevant continuous learning experiences. This includes, but is not limited to, building leadership and management skills, as well as providing technical and functional training to all employees.  Environmental Matters Environmental Sustainability The Company strives to be a strong environmental steward, and realizes that its strategy and efforts need to continuously evolve in the face of a changing climate. The Company\u2019s environmental sustainability strategy has three focus areas: \u2022Driving operational efficiency; \u2022Designing new products to minimize environmental impact; and \u2022Reducing any impacts in the Company\u2019s upstream and downstream value chain. A primary focus of the Company in each of these areas is on climate action. Merck believes that climate change could present risks to its business, as discussed in further detail in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under the  22 22 22 Table of Contents Table of Contents headings \u201cClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects\u201d and \u201cEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation.\u201d Some of the potential impacts of climate change to the Company\u2019s business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to the Company\u2019s facilities, water limitations and disruptions to its supply chain. These potential risks are integrated into the Company\u2019s business planning, including investment in reducing energy usage, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, the Company\u2019s Scope 1, 2 and 3, reduction targets were verified by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The Company has made progress toward its climate goals and aspires to meet and exceed the evolving expectations of its stakeholders and employees. These goals include achieving carbon neutrality for greenhouse gas emissions across operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 2025, reducing Scope 1 and 2 operational greenhouse gas emissions 46% by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline), reducing Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline), and sourcing 100% of its purchased electricity from renewables by 2025. Other environmental sustainability initiatives of the Company include: \u2022Low Carbon Transition Playbook. In 2021, the Company launched its Low Carbon Transition Playbook, a tool intended to help create a site strategy by identifying gaps, uncovering opportunities and creating a common platform for assessment of levers and resource deployment across a range of sustainability initiatives. It also details how employees and stakeholders can accelerate the Company\u2019s environmental work, along with explanations of the collective benefits of these actions for the business and for stakeholders. Functions across the Company are expected to take advantage of this document to strategize and develop new ways to meet many of the Company\u2019s broader sustainability goals and streamline the Company\u2019s tracking and reporting of specific metrics and categories. \u2022Waste Diversion Playbook. In 2022, the Company created its Waste Diversion Playbook, which is a tool, similar to the Low Carbon Transition Playbook, to help sites self-assess and develop their waste diversion strategies to achieve the Company\u2019s corporate waste goals. The objectives are to identify and prioritize the most effective and least resource intensive actions, improve tracking and reporting and generate knowledge sharing between sites. \u2022Partnering for progress across the Company\u2019s value chain. The Company is a signatory to Schneider Electric\u2019s Energize program, a pioneering collaboration to help pharmaceutical and health care suppliers address their own operational Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions through green power procurement, which in turn is intended to help the signatories reduce their Scope 3 emissions. \u2022Product stewardship and green and sustainable science. The Company\u2019s product stewardship program focuses on identifying and either preventing or minimizing potential safety and environmental hazards throughout a product\u2019s life cycle. The Company is also committed to understanding, managing and reducing the environmental impacts of its products and the materials associated with discovering and producing them. The Company\u2019s green and sustainable science program uses a \u201cgreen-by-design\u201d approach. By using more efficient and innovative processing methods and technologies, the Company is reducing the amount of energy, water and raw materials the Company uses to make the Company\u2019s products, thereby reducing the amount of waste the Company generates and lowering the Company\u2019s production costs. Management does not believe that expenditures related to these initiatives should have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year. Environmental Regulation and Remediation The Company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites. Expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $4 million in 2022 and are estimated to be $23 million in the aggregate for the years 2023 through 2027. These amounts do not consider potential recoveries from other parties. The Company has taken an active role in identifying and accruing for these costs and, in management\u2019s opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $39 million and $40 million at December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed approximately $35 million in the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these expenditures should have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year. 23 23 23  Table of Contents Table of Contents Geographic Area Information The Company\u2019s operations outside the U.S. are conducted primarily through subsidiaries.

Merck has operations in countries located in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific.
