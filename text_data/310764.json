We bring patients and physicians advanced implant designs and specialized instrumentation that make orthopaedic surgery and recovery simpler, faster and more effective. We support surgeons with the technology and services they need as they develop new surgical techniques. The Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgical System was designed to help surgeons provide patients with a personalized surgical experience based on their specific diagnosis and anatomy. The Mako System currently offers three applications supporting Partial Knee, Total Hip and Total Knee procedures. Mako is the only robotic-arm assisted technology enabled by 3D CT-based pre-operative planning and, with AccuStop\u2122 haptic technology, Mako provides surgeons the ability to know more about their patients' anatomy so they can cut less in bone preparation and implant placement with intra-operative haptic guidance.

Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features. We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage. On December\u00a031, 2022 we owned approximately 4,800 United States patents and approximately 7,300 patents in other countries.SeasonalityOur business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months, and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.CompetitionIn each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies. The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business. Competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces.We believe our commitment to innovation, quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively. We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. RegulationOur businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. We are required to comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each country within which we market and sell our products.In the United States the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for federal regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products. In addition, state licensing requirements often apply to certain of our business operations and products. On the federal level, many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them. Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications. Certain of our products also fall under other FDA classifications, such as drugs and Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products.The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.The European Union enacted the European Union Medical Device Regulation in May 2017 with an original effective date of May 2021 (the transition timeline is currently being reevaluated by the European Parliament), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems, labeling and post-market surveillance.

These statements are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity. Words that identify forward-looking statements include, without limitation, words such as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"possible,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"forecast,\" \"potential,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"may impact,\" \"on track,\" \"goal,\" \"strategy\" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements, historical experience or our present expectations. Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include the risks discussed below. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material or that could apply to any company may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. We disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which those expectations may be based, or that affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKSWe use a variety of raw materials, components, devices and third-party services in our global supply chains, production and distribution processes; significant shortages, price increases or unavailability of third-party services could increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the competitive position of our products: Our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials, components and finished devices, and on certain third-party service providers, such as sterilization service providers, exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices, whether due to inflationary pressure, regulatory changes, litigation exposure or otherwise. For example, certain of our products contain electronic components and we have experienced, and could continue to experience, limited product availability due to the electronic components shortage in certain product lines. If the shortage persists, we may not be able to obtain electronic components from our suppliers on a timely basis, or at all, or identify any alternative suppliers to provide the electronic components we need to produce our products. In addition, several raw materials, components, finished devices and services are procured from a sole source due to the quality considerations, unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements. If sole-source suppliers or service providers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials or services, we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer. In certain cases, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or service providers for such services in a timely or cost-effective manner, largely as a result of FDA and other regulations that require, among other things, validation of materials, components and services prior to  Competitive Pay and BenefitsOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract and retain top talent and to incentivize performance and alignment to our mission and values.We offer market-competitive base pay and benefits to our employees in countries around the world.
