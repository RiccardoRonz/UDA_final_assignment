We also provide specialized tax products to accounting professionals, who are key partners that help us serve small business customers. Our mission is to power prosperity around the world. Across our platform, we use the power of technology to deliver three core benefits to our customers: helping put more money in their pockets, saving them time by eliminating work so they can focus on what matters to them, and ensuring that they have complete confidence in every financial decision they make. All of our customers have a common set of needs. Our global financial technology platform, which includes TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, is designed to help consumers and small businesses manage their finances, get and retain customers, save money, pay off debt, and do their taxes with ease and confidence so they receive the maximum refund they deserve. For those customers who have made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs and go into business for themselves, we are focused on helping them find and keep customers, get paid faster, pay their employees, manage and get access to capital, and ensure their books are done right. We serve 100 million customers and generated revenue of $14.4 billion in our fiscal year ended July\u00a031, 2023.

Intuit is uniquely positioned for the next wave of transformation with generative AI given our rich data platform and established AI foundation.

We listen to and observe our customers, understand their challenges, and then use advanced technology, including AI, to develop innovative solutions to help consumers and small businesses prosper. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to become a global AI-driven expert platform and five strategic priorities, or \u201cbig bets,\u201d as the primary areas of focus to drive durable growth. We are investing heavily in our data and AI capabilities to deliver accelerated innovation where we and others can solve our customers\u2019 most important problems. We are accelerating the development of the platform by applying AI in three key areas: \u2022An Open Platform: None of us can do it alone, including Intuit. The best way to deliver for customers is by creating an open, collaborative platform. It\u2019s the power of partnerships that accelerates the world\u2019s success. Our open technology platform allows partners to integrate with our offerings so, together, we can deliver value and benefits that matter the most to our customers. \u2022Application of AI: We believe AI is essential to how we help our customers work smarter because we can automate, predict, and personalize their experiences. Intuit has built AI capabilities into our products and services for nearly a decade, including machine learning, knowledge engineering, natural language processing and understanding, and, more recently, fine-tuned financial large language models. Our investment in AI, and generative AI in particular, provides a foundation for us to innovate at scale and with speed to build new customer experiences. \u2022Incorporating Experts: One of the biggest problems our customers face is lack of confidence. Even with current advances in technology that deliver personalized tools and insights, many customers want to connect with a real person to help give them the confidence they are making the right decision. By bringing experts onto our platform, we can solve this massive problem for customers. The power of our virtual expert platform allows us to scale the intelligence of our products, elevating experts to advisors, and delivering big benefits for customers.  As we continue to build our AI-driven expert platform, we prioritize resources on our five big bets across the company. These priorities focus on solving the problems that matter most to customers and include: \u2022Revolutionizing speed to benefit: When customers use our products and services, we use the power of data-driven customer insights to deliver value instantly and aim to make interactions with our offerings frictionless, without the need for customers to manually enter data. We are accelerating the application of AI to deliver breakthrough innovations to customers. We are also investing in other emerging technologies, such as decentralized technologies, with a goal to revolutionize the customer experience and help customers put more money in their pockets faster. This priority is foundational across our business, and execution against it positions us to succeed with our other four strategic priorities. \u2022Connecting people to experts: The largest problem our customers face is lack of confidence to file their own taxes or to manage their books. To build their confidence, we connect our customers to experts. We offer customers access to experts to help them make important decisions \u2013 and experts, such as accountants, gain access to new customers so they can grow their businesses. We are also expanding how we think about virtual experiences by broadening the segments we serve beyond tax and accounting, to play a more meaningful role in our customers\u2019 financial lives.  \u2022Unlocking smart money decisions: Crippling high-cost debt and lack of savings are at unprecedented levels across the U.S. To address these challenges, we are creating a comprehensive, self-driving financial platform with Credit Karma that propels our members forward wherever they are on their financial journey, so they can understand their financial picture, make smart financial decisions, and stick to their financial plan in the near term and long term. \u2022Be the center of small business growth: We are focused on helping customers grow their businesses by offering a broad, seamless set of tools that are designed to help them get and retain customers, get paid faster, manage and get access to capital, pay employees with confidence, and use third-party apps to help run their businesses. At the same time, we want to position ourselves to better serve product-based businesses to benefit customers who sell products through multiple channels. \u2022Disrupt the small business mid-market: We aim to disrupt the mid-market with a tailor-made ecosystem of offerings. QuickBooks Online Advanced, as well as our workforce solutions, payments, and bill pay offerings, are designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. Additionally, Mailchimp\u2019s marketing platform enables mid-market businesses to digitally promote their business across email, social media, landing pages, ads, websites, and more, all from one place. These offerings enable us to increase retention of these larger customers and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by available offerings. As the external environment evolves, we continue to innovate and adapt our strategy and anticipate our customers\u2019 needs. For 40 years, we have been dedicated to developing innovative solutions that are designed to solve our customers' most important financial problems, are easy to use, and are available where and when customers need them. As a result, our customers actively recommend our products and solutions to others, which is one important way that we measure the success of our strategy.  \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K5 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K5 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K5 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 5  Tables of Contents Tables of Contents PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES During fiscal 2023, we offered our products and services in the four segments described in \u201cOur Business Portfolio\u201d above.

Small Business & Self-Employed Our Small Business & Self-Employed segment serves small businesses and the self-employed around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. Our goal is for QuickBooks to be the source of truth for each small business customer who uses our AI-driven expert platform. We work to make this a reality through our three-pillared growth strategy: Grow the Core by transforming financial management software; Connect the Ecosystem, by meeting a wider range of customer needs with a single integrated platform; and Expand Globally, by serving small businesses around the world. With this strategy, we enable a powerful ecosystem, personalized using artificial intelligence, that scales across our customers\u2019 most pressing needs. Small business owners are constantly faced with challenges and barriers in their journey to success. Universally, small businesses at every stage of growth struggle to get customers, get paid, get capital, pay workers, get access to advice, and stay compliant and organized. Our innovative, end-to-end customer growth platform provides actionable, AI-driven insights our customers need to grow and run their businesses with confidence.  Get Customers  Mailchimp.

ProTax Our ProTax segment includes our professional tax offerings and serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings consist of Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT The markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Continuous investment is required to innovate and develop new products and services, as well as enhance existing offerings to be successful in these markets. Our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy. We develop many of our products and services internally, and we have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties, and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy. Our online offerings have rapid development cycles, while our traditional desktop software products tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles. In addition, developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements, and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project. We continue to make substantial investments in research and development, and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations, personalization, and ease of use enabled by AI and other advanced technologies. We continue to focus on developing new products and services,  \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K8 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K8 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K8 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 8 Tables of Contents Tables of Contents including global offerings, and significant research and development efforts for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings.  SEASONALITY SEASONALITY Our Consumer and ProTax offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.  In fiscal 2021, the IRS extended the tax filing deadline from April to May 17, 2021. As a result of this extension, a significant amount of our fiscal 2021 Consumer segment and ProTax segment revenues were recognized in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022. We expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProTax businesses to continue to have a material impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.  MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS Markets  Our primary customers are consumers and small businesses. We also provide specialized tax and accounting products to professional accountants, who are key partners to help us reach small business customers. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. The widespread usage of mobile devices and social media, and the evolution of AI, have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services. Real-time, personalized online shopping experiences are the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, and other changes in the way we do business. Marketing Programs We use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales, develop leads, increase general awareness of the Intuit brand and our product portfolio, and drive sales in retail. These programs include offline marketing such as TV and radio advertising; digital marketing such as display and pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, and social and affiliate marketing; mobile marketing through online app stores; email marketing; retail marketing; public relations; sponsorships; podcast marketing; and in-product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services.\u00a0Our campaigns are designed to attract new users, retain existing users, and cross sell additional offerings. Sales and Distribution Channels Multi-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences. Our customers primarily research products and services online. Some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online. Others research online but make their purchase at a retail location. Because many customers shop across multiple channels, we continue to coordinate our online, offline, and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated, multi-channel shop-and-buy model. We also focus on cross-selling complementary Intuit and third-party offerings online and in-product. Direct Sales Channel. We offer many of our products and services directly through our websites, apps, and call centers. Direct online sales are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase decisions based on content provided on our websites, via other online content or word-of-mouth recommendations.\u00a0For many of our products, assisted sales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers who want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on U.S. and international accounting firms and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our small business and professional tax solutions. For mid-market businesses, we have implemented and expanded on our omnichannel go-to-market strategy by diversifying and growing our technology partner channel and industry-focused direct sales teams. Mobile Application Stores. We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices. Partner and Other Channels. We offer many of our products and services through partners including value-added resellers, system integrators (including accountants and marketing professionals), and managed service providers who help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. These partners combine our products and services with marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. We also sell our QuickBooks Online and TurboTax Desktop offerings at retail locations across the United States and Canada and on  \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K9 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K9 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K9 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 9 Tables of Contents Tables of Contents retailer websites. Additionally, we sell our QuickBooks Enterprise software on retailer websites. In Canada, we also rely on distributors who sell products into the retail channel.  COMPETITION COMPETITION We face intense competition in all of our businesses in all aspects across all markets for our products and services, which are rapidly evolving, fragmented, and have complex interdependencies with many businesses. Competitive pressures in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Our competitors may introduce superior products and services, successfully use and deploy new technologies such as AI that may reduce customer demand for our products or services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing and other resources, have greater brand recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services. The competitive landscape is also constantly evolving as we expand into new market segments and extend our capabilities and new companies emerge and existing companies expand their capabilities (either directly or through acquisitions or partnerships) to include the markets in which we operate. Given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global financial technology company and the customer problems that we aim to solve, we compete with offerings from a variety of companies across a range of industries, including large global companies, smaller geographically focused companies, startups and professional services. Companies that have offerings that we may compete with include: \u2022business software providers, such as those that provide accounting, business management and financial software, marketing automation, customer relationship management, inventory management, payroll and employee management; \u2022private and publicly-funded tax preparation and filing service providers; \u2022accounting, consulting and tax firms;  \u2022software companies and banks that provide payments services, including merchant payment processing, checking, bill pay, savings, loans, point of sale devices and small business financing;  \u2022software companies that provide personal finance management products and tools, including access to credit scores, credit and identity monitoring, credit-building tools, and tools to help understand net worth and make financial progress; \u2022companies that provide a marketplace of consumer financial offerings; \u2022financial institutions;  \u2022credit bureaus; and \u2022large platform companies that could develop competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face. We believe our most important competitive factors are our innovation and technology capabilities, functionality, ease of use, and security of our offerings, the integration of our offerings with each other and third-party offerings, brand recognition and reputation, quality of support, and cost. We believe that we compete favorably based on these factors and our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance.   CUSTOMER SUCCESS CUSTOMER SUCCESS For many of our offerings, we provide support through channels including telephone, e-mail, online and video chat, text messaging, our customer support websites, self-help assets embedded in our products, and online communities where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other. We also provide access to experts, through our TurboTax and QuickBooks Live offerings, who provide tax advice, tax preparation, and bookkeeping services. Our customer success staff predominantly consists of Intuit-employed and outsourced experts. We supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch. We augment the services we provide with outsourced partnerships domestically and internationally. Most of our internationally outsourced small business customer success personnel are currently located in the Philippines. We also source staff through our Prosperity Hub program, which is designed to spark economic prosperity in underserved communities. One part of this program is our socially responsible sourcing model, where we both directly and through customer success partner-employers, hire, train, and retain workers who deliver support and services for our customers.

We completed the transition of our systems, networks, and databases used to operate these online offerings to public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Desktop Software and Supplies An increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software, however, a portion of our customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media. The key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs (CDs), printing boxes and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final products. When physical product is ordered, we typically ship the physical product within a few days of receiving an order and backlog is minimal.  PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER AND WORKFORCE INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER AND WORKFORCE INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS We are stewards of our customers\u2019 data and have designed data stewardship principles to align our organization in collecting, using, and protecting such information. As we believe strongly in being good stewards of our customers\u2019 data, we operate our program to comply with laws and regulations that govern our use, sharing and protection of customers\u2019 personal information, including, for example, laws with respect to financial services and the handling of tax data. We have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and members of our workforce are aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to inform public policy for privacy and security.  We use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information that customers and members of our workforce give to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration. We use technical, logical and procedural measures which are designed to help detect and prevent fraud and misuse of customer information. Whenever customers transmit sensitive information to us, such as credit card information or tax return data through one of our websites or products, we follow current industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us, and when we store it at rest. We routinely patch our systems with security updates and we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products, as well as internally developed security procedures and practices.  GOVERNMENT REGULATION GOVERNMENT REGULATION Our Consumer and ProTax segments are subject to federal, state, and international government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. Our Small Business & Self-Employed segment offers products and services to small businesses and consumers, such as payroll, payments, and other financial service offerings, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements. Our Credit Karma segment offers personal finance products and services to consumers, such as recommendations of credit card, loan and insurance products and access to credit scores and reports, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements.    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings. We protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms, including copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, we regularly file applications for patents, copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to Intuit\u2019s overall competitive advantage, although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time. We also have a number of registered trademarks that include Intuit, QuickBooks, Lacerte, TurboTax, QB, ProSeries, ProConnect, Mint, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp. We have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the United States and, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. Most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products. Although our portfolio of patents is growing, the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction. In addition, third parties have asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement claims against us and our customers. These claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages. Litigation, even if without merit,  \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K11 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K11 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K11 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 11 Tables of Contents Tables of Contents could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, third-party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.  HUMAN CAPITAL HUMAN CAPITAL We consider our employees one of our four True North key stakeholders because they help us deliver for our customers, our shareholders, and the communities we serve. As of July\u00a031, 2023, we had approximately 18,200 employees in 10 countries. During fiscal 2023, we employed on average approximately 9,400 seasonal employees from January to April primarily to support our Consumer segment customers during the peak of tax season. We believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce in all areas of our business.  Intuit\u2019s overall workforce development strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People & Places Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight with respect to company-wide organization and talent assessment, employee recruitment, engagement and retention, leadership development, management depth and strength assessment, workplace environment and culture, employee health and safety, and pay equity. Of the total number of employees, approximately 1,800 are employed by Credit Karma, which has certain unique compensation and workforce development programs. We regularly collect, measure, and share the sentiment of our workforce through multiple channels, including engagement surveys and other touch points, which help to guide the work we do to support our workforce. Culture and Values In order to deliver on our mission to power prosperity around the world, we are guided by our company values as we strive to create a culture where employees can do the best work of their lives. Our values and culture are woven into our hiring and retention practices and are foundational to our ability to attract, retain, and advance top, diverse talent. \u2022Our value of Integrity Without Compromise means valuing trust above all else, speaking the truth, and doing the right thing even when no one is looking. \u2022Our value of Courage means being bold and fearless in how we think and act, holding a high bar for performance, and valuing speed, with a bias for learning and action.  \u2022Our value of Customer Obsession means falling in love with our customers\u2019 problems and delivering solutions that delight our customers. \u2022Our value of Stronger Together means championing diversity, inclusion and a respectful environment, thriving on diverse voices to challenge and inform decisions and delivering exceptional work so others can count on us. \u2022Our value of We Care and Give Back means we strive to be stewards of the future, strengthen the communities around us, and give everyone the opportunity to prosper. We provide eligible full-time employees paid time off that can be used to do volunteer work during normal work hours for vetted non-profits and donation matching up to an annual limit. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion At the foundation of our culture is a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). We believe that diversity is a fact, but treating people equitably and inclusively are choices we make. To deliver for our customers, we seek to foster a workforce that is as diverse as the communities we serve. When we do this, we believe we develop deeper empathy, accelerating innovation to solve the biggest problems our customers face. We have had a designated role dedicated to diversity and inclusion since 2015 and our Chief Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Officer (CDEIO) leads a dedicated and specialized team in our DEI efforts. Our Compensation and Organizational Development Committee oversees Intuit\u2019s DEI initiatives in support of organizational development. Intuit\u2019s strategy is operationalized through the following elements:  \u2022Goals and transparency: Intuit has set short- and long-term goals for increasing the representation in our workforce of women in technology roles globally and employees from underrepresented racial groups in the U.S. (which we define as Black/African-American, Hispanic or Latino, Native American, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian). Our diversity data is shared with all employees, and progress on our goals is reviewed monthly with all executives. We also publicly disclose our progress on our goals and the breakdowns of the diversity of gender and underrepresented racial groups in our workforce both in the aggregate and among our leadership and technology roles; \u2022Center of Excellence: The CDEIO leads a cross-functional team with expertise in enterprise leadership, strategy, human resources and communications all focused on driving a more diverse and inclusive workplace; \u2022Employee Resource Groups: Intuit\u2019s employee resource groups aid in creating community, recruiting, on-boarding, and providing safe spaces for our diverse workforce; \u2022Engagement: Intuit includes dedicated DEI questions in our semi-annual employee engagement surveys focused on the experiences of our workforce; \u2022REAL Team: Intuit has a Racial Equity Advancement Leadership (REAL) team that is focused on helping us drive durable change as we strive to continue advancing racial equity and equality; \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K12 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K12 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K12 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 12 Tables of Contents Tables of Contents \u2022Education: All senior leaders have attended multiple DEI workshops, including C-suite training on racial equity. We have manager and employee training on topics such as unconscious bias, racial equity, and leading inclusively and a guide for managers on how to have conversations about difficult and polarizing external events;  \u2022Talent acquisition: Intuit has established a dedicated team to drive diversity, equity, and inclusion across our hiring practices, programs, and strategies. We have also invested in new, external partnerships to better engage with diverse talent and communities; and \u2022Accountability: The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee reviews our progress toward our goals and workforce diversity initiatives at least annually. We strive to reward employees with compensation that is market competitive, fair, and equitable across gender, race, and ethnicity. We invest in this commitment by performing pay equity analyses twice a year using independent, third-party vendors. We are transparent about our pay equity results and have multiple avenues for employees to use for any questions about their pay.  Developing Talent and Training  We are committed to creating a high-performing culture that consistently delivers for our customers, shareholders, and communities while providing an experience for our workforce that values leadership, innovation, and collaboration. We promote the development of all of our employees and provide employees with access to learning plans based on their needs and interests and the resources they need to grow, thrive and reinvent themselves over time.  In addition, we are invested in growing our current and future leaders. Our teams design programs and resources to develop the leadership skills of our employees and measure their progress. All full-time employees have access to opportunities to develop and learn through company-sponsored learning paths and online courses on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to manager essentials in support of an employee\u2019s ability to adapt to any work environment. Employees set goals and measure progress through our goal setting tool and have opportunities to focus on growth both during performance assessment conversations and ongoing regular check-ins. Employee Listening and Engagement Listening and responding to our employees is at the core of our work. We value employee feedback and we leverage it to continuously improve the employee experience. We regularly collect, measure, and share the sentiment of our workforce through multiple channels, including engagement surveys, and other touch points, which help to guide the work we do to support our workforce. Total Rewards \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our compensation philosophy aims to attract and retain top talent for today and the future. Intuit\u2019s total target compensation includes base hourly pay or salary at market-competitive rates, a range of incentive plans that vary based on role, and equity grants. Incentive compensation plans are part of our pay for performance philosophy and closely align with company performance and reward top performance. Most year-round employees are eligible for equity, which allows the majority of our employees to share in the company\u2019s success. Additional benefits and rewards include healthcare, retirement benefits, and paid time off, including annual paid recharge days and family and parental leave. The health and well-being of our employees and their families continues to be a top priority. We offer our employees access to programs to support their physical, emotional, and financial well-being. Employees also have access to other resources to help with their well-being, including resilience, mindfulness and counseling programs, wellness reimbursement programs, back-up childcare, financial education programs, and access to an employee assistance program. Hybrid Way of Working  After shifting to working virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep our workforce safe, we are now embracing a hybrid work model at Intuit. Our hybrid work model brings the best of in-person collaboration and connections together with the flexibility of virtual work. Self-directed teams are empowered to decide where/when in-person work is accretive to their work. Across the company, we expect teams to spend a portion of their time working on campus. This hybrid way of working invests in and amplifies Intuit\u2019s culture. In doing so, we seek to realize a sense of connectedness and belonging; to spark creativity and innovation; to solve for speed, agility, and productivity; and to attract and retain top, diverse talent to the company.  \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K13 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K13 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K13 \u00a0Intuit Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 13  Tables of Contents Tables of Contents INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The following table shows Intuit\u2019s executive officers and their areas of responsibility as of August 1, 2023.
