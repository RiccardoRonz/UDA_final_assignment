The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers, ranchers, and all those who enjoy living the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the \u201cOut Here\u201d lifestyle).\u00a0\u00a0We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company, Petsense by Tractor Supply, and Orscheln Farm and Home.  Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities. We also offer an expanded assortment of products through the Tractor Supply mobile application and online at TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com.\u00a0   The Company has one reportable industry segment which is the retail sale of products that support the rural lifestyle.  At December\u00a031, 2022, we operated 2,333 retail stores in 49 states (2,066 Tractor Supply retail stores, 186 Petsense by Tractor Supply retail stores, and 81 Orscheln Farm and Home retail stores).  Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of inside selling space, along with additional outside selling space (\u201cSide Lot\u201d), and our Petsense by Tractor Supply stores have approximately 5,500 square feet of inside selling space.  For Tractor Supply retail locations, we use a standard design for most new built-to-suit locations that includes approximately 15,500 square feet of inside selling space.  Our online selling websites and our mobile application offer an extended assortment of products beyond those offered in-store and drive traffic into our stores through our buy online and pickup in-store and ship to store programs.  Our retail store locations and digital capabilities provide the convenience to allow our customers to engage with us anytime, anywhere and in any way they choose.   On October 12, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, LLC (\u201cOrscheln\u201d or \u201cOrscheln Farm and Home\u201d). The Company acquired 166 Orscheln stores for approximately $397.7\u00a0million, exclusive of cash acquired. Consistent with the remedy reached with the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), the Company divested 85 store locations to two buyers, Bomgaars Supply, Inc. (73 stores) and Buchheit Enterprises, Inc. (12 stores), concurrently with the closing of the acquisition. Net proceeds from the store divestitures were approximately $69.4\u00a0million. In addition, Tractor Supply has agreed to sell the Orscheln corporate headquarters and distribution center to Bomgaars Supply, Inc. for approximately $10 million within 15 months after the closing of the acquisition. The acquisition was financed with cash-on-hand and borrowings under the 2022 Senior Credit Facility (as defined below). The Company plans to rebrand all Orscheln stores to Tractor Supply stores by the end of fiscal 2023. Therefore, disclosure of the Company's non-financial, normal course business activities are presented without Orscheln unless otherwise noted.  Business Strategy for Tractor Supply Company   We believe our sales and earnings growth is the result of executing our multi-year strategy, which includes the following key components: \u00a0 Market Niche  We have identified a specialized market niche: supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers, ranchers, and all those who enjoy living the rural lifestyle.\u00a0 By focusing our product assortment on these core customers, we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise, home center, and other specialty retailers.  We cater to the rural lifestyle and often serve a market by being a trip consolidator for many basic maintenance needs for farm, ranch, and rural customers through convenient shopping options both in-store and online.  Customers  Our target customers are home, land, pet, and livestock owners who generally have above average income and below average cost of living.  We seek to serve a customer base that primarily lives in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities. This customer base includes recreational farmers, ranchers, and all those who enjoy living the rural lifestyle. We have seen a trend of consumers migrating to more rural areas and a continuation of shifting consumer behavior trends due to the COVID-19 pandemic as customers focused on the care of their homes, land, and animals, which resulted in a growing demand in everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable, and edible (\u201cC.U.E.\u201d) products and seasonal categories.   1 1 1 Index Index Customer Service  We are committed to providing our customers reliable product availability and a convenient, customer-centric experience across shopping channels.  In our stores, we believe the ability of our motivated, well-trained team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps our customers find the right products to satisfy their everyday needs, as well as the specialty items needed to complete their rural lifestyle projects. We also engage with our customers through our e-commerce websites and mobile application, which provide the opportunity to allow customers to shop anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose, while delivering enhanced product information, research, and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.\u00a0Additionally, we maintain a Customer Solutions Center at our Store Support Center located in Brentwood, Tennessee, to support our in-store and online customers, as well as our store team members.  We believe this commitment to customer service promotes strong customer loyalty through personalized experiences and provides convenience that our customers expect, which drives repeat shopping experiences.     We use a third-party provider to survey and measure our level of customer service.\u00a0\u00a0This process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience.\u00a0\u00a0Based on the third-party provider\u2019s data, we believe our customer satisfaction scores are among the best-in-class.\u00a0\u00a0We carefully evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at both the Company and the individual store level based on that feedback.  Store Environment  Our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0Stores are strategically arranged to provide an open environment for optimal product placement and visual display.  In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions. Display and product placement information is routinely sent to stores to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores, and our Field Activity Support Teams (\u201cFAST\u201d) are dedicated to support the stores in creating an enhanced in-store experience for our customers through best-in-class merchandising execution.\u00a0Our store layouts and visual displays are designed to provide our customers a feeling of familiarity and convenience to enhance the shopping experience.\u00a0Informative signs are located in key product categories to conveniently assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.\u00a0\u00a0These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing, useful information regarding product benefits, and suggestions for appropriate accessories.  Also, our store team members wear highly visible red vests or aprons with name tags, and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located near the front of the store. Our stores have been equipped with tools such as team member communication devices, wireless internet, and mobile point-of-sale devices that enable our team members to provide an enhanced shopping experience to our customers.  In addition, our buy online and pickup in-store and ship to store programs, including curbside pickup, provide convenient access for customers to pick up merchandise from our store locations. We also offer delivery in all of our stores, as well as rentable trailers and store delivery in the portion of our stores with delivery trucks and trailers, all to meet our customers' needs.  We are in the midst of a multi-year project that began in 2020 to remodel our existing store base, bringing programs to life with new fixtures, layouts and products that truly enhance the customer shopping experience. The site level space is analyzed category by category and reallocated as needed to align with current merchandising strategies and to drive space productivity. Another space productivity initiative is to transform our Side Lot with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the Side Lot space is leveraged to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories and our new categories within the garden center, and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online and pickup in-store and ship to store capabilities for drive-thru pickup.  Merchandising and Purchasing  We offer an extensive assortment of products for all those seeking to enjoy the \u201cOut Here\u201d lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0Our product assortment is tailored to meet the needs of our customers in various geographic markets.\u00a0 Our full line of product offerings includes a broad selection of high quality, reputable brand name and exclusive brand products with approximately 17,000 to 23,000 products per store as well as over 250,000 products online.\u00a0\u00a0No single product accounted for more than 10% of our sales during fiscal 2022.  Our comprehensive selection of merchandise is comprised of the following major product categories:  \u2022Equine, livestock, pet, and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth, and containment (i.e., fencing); \u2022Hardware, truck, towing, and tool products; \u2022Seasonal products, including heating, lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts, and toys; \u2022Work/recreational clothing and footwear; and \u2022Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use. 2 2 2 Index Index  The following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020: \u00a0Percent of Net SalesFiscal YearProduct Category:202220212020Livestock and Pet50\u00a0%47\u00a0%47\u00a0%Seasonal, Gift and Toy Products21\u00a021\u00a021\u00a0Hardware, Tools and Truck19\u00a021\u00a021\u00a0Clothing and Footwear7\u00a08\u00a07\u00a0Agriculture3\u00a03\u00a04\u00a0Total100\u00a0%100\u00a0%100\u00a0%  Our buying team continuously reviews and updates our product assortment as necessary to respond to customer needs and to offer new, relevant products. \u00a0We are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on C.U.E. products.\u00a0 Examples of C.U.E. product categories include, but are not limited to, livestock feed and bedding, pet food, bird seed, lubricants, propane, and various seasonal products, such as fertilizer, weed control, mulch, pest control, and twine.   Our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors, each of whom are expected to adhere to a code of conduct that guides our relationship.\u00a0\u00a0Our business is not dependent upon any single vendor or particular group of vendors.\u00a0\u00a0We purchase our products from a group of approximately 1,000 vendors, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2022.\u00a0\u00a0Approximately 400 core vendors accounted for 90% of our merchandise purchases during fiscal 2022.\u00a0We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products to meet customer demands despite the global supply chain disruptions and delays. We believe that adequate sources of supply exist, but they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs.\u00a0   Our buying teams focus on merchandise procurement, vendor line reviews, and testing of new products and programs.\u00a0\u00a0We also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on forecasting and inventory replenishment, a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning, and a specialized pricing team that seeks to optimize market-specific pricing for our products.\u00a0\u00a0Through the combined efforts of these teams, we continue to focus on improving our overall inventory productivity and in-stock inventory position.  Intellectual Property   Our subsidiary, Tractor Supply Co. of Texas, LP (\u201cTSCT\u201d), owns registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) for various service marks including TSC\u00ae, Tractor Supply Co.\u00ae, TSC Tractor Supply Co.\u00ae, and the trapezium design for retail services.  We consider these service marks, and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition, to be valuable assets of our business.  TSCT also owns several other service marks for retail services, some of which have been registered with the USPTO and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO.   In addition to selling products that bear nationally-known manufacturer brands, we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business.  These exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands, which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination retailer.    3 3 3 Index Index Excluding Orscheln Farm and Home, our exclusive brands represented approximately 30% of our total sales in fiscal 2022, and 29% of our total sales in each of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.  Our exclusive brands include:   4health\u00ae (pet foods and supplies) Producer\u2019s Pride\u00ae (livestock and horse feed and supplies) American Farmworks\u00ae (livestock, farm and ranch Red Shed\u00ae (gifts, collectibles, and outdoor furniture)equipment) Bit & Bridle\u00ae (apparel and footwear) Redstone\u00ae (heating products) Blue Mountain\u00ae (apparel) Retriever\u00ae (pet foods and supplies) C.E.

Our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates; however, provided that we continue to use the marks and file appropriate maintenance and renewal documentation with the USPTO in a timely manner, the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration.  Our patents (both United States and foreign) have expiration dates ranging from April 2027 to May 2037 and protect various elements, designs or functions of farm and ranch equipment, as well as light systems for trucks and other vehicles.   We believe our intellectual property, which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above, together with certain trade names, domain names, patents, and copyrights, has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies.    Distribution  We currently operate a distribution facility network for supplying stores with merchandise and delivering product ordered through our websites and mobile application.  In fiscal 2022, our Tractor Supply stores received approximately 78% of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly from our vendors to our stores or customers.  We believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise that allows us to be a dependable supplier to our customers for their \u201cOut Here\u201d lifestyle solutions by enhancing in-stock inventory positions, while minimizing freight expense and improving the inventory turn rate.  Our distribution facilities, located in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New York, and Texas represent a total distribution center capacity of 6.0 million square feet. This excludes the distribution center in Missouri acquired through the acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home that is anticipated to be sold within 15 months of the closing of the acquisition.  We also use third-party operated import centers, mixing centers and pop-up distribution facilities which provide additional distribution capacity. On January 18, 2023, the Company opened its ninth distribution center located in Navarre, Ohio, which expanded the distribution center capacity by approximately 900,000 square feet. In addition, the Company is building a new distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas. This new facility will expand the Company\u2019s distribution center capacity by 1,200,000 square feet and is anticipated to begin operations in the first quarter of 2024.  We select the locations of our distribution facilities in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution facilities to our stores.  Our distribution centers utilize warehouse and labor management tools that support the planning, control, and processing of inventory.  We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a transportation management system.\u00a0 We utilize multiple common carriers for store and direct to customer deliveries.  We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, monitoring of transportation routes, and scheduling of deliveries.  4 4 4 Index Index Marketing  Leveraging our value-driving offerings from our Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program, we utilize an \u201ceveryday low price\u201d philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by limited and strategically planned promotions throughout the year.  To drive store traffic, build brand consideration, and position ourselves as a destination retailer, we promote a broad selection of merchandise and our \u201cLife Out Here\u201d brand messaging through digital and social media initiatives, targeted digital video (connected TV and streaming programming), e-mail and direct mail.\u00a0 In addition, our rapidly growing Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program enhances our ability to engage with our customers, recognize and reward our best customers, drive desired behaviors, and create brand advocacy.  Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions, additional funding, and honoring coupons.  Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, brochures, support for in-store events, point-of-purchase materials for customer education, and product knowledge for our team members.\u00a0  Omni-Channel  Ensuring that our customers can engage with us in the most convenient manner for them whether in our stores, on our website, on our mobile application, or via our Customer Solutions Center, is a high priority for us.

We provide our customers the ability to have products shipped directly to our retail store locations or delivered to their homes or offices.  For select products, we offer same day delivery. We use our distribution facility network as well as our stores to support our e-commerce activities. Our digital capabilities have further enhanced our in-store shopping experience, allowing us to engage with our customers more effectively, and expanded our target markets outside of our current retail store locations.  Continuous Improvement  We are committed to a continuous improvement program to drive change throughout our organization. \u00a0Using data analytics and team member engagement, we examine business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs, drive innovation, and improve effectiveness.  We establish annual goals for productivity and cost improvement. \u00a0We have implemented several continuous improvement projects, with team members across our business, to evaluate key operations and implement process changes.  Team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes.  Management encourages the participation of all team members in the decision-making process, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members, and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.  Management Information and Control Systems  We have invested resources in management information and control systems to provide legendary customer service and to deliver the right products in the right place at the right time.  This investment includes use of digital technologies that support the \u201cOut Here\u201d lifestyle and integrate the customer experience in-store, online, and through our Customer Solutions Center, which offers customers the ability to shop anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose.  Our key platforms include:  \u2022Point-of-sale system; \u2022In-store mobility; \u2022E-commerce platform; \u2022Consumer mobile app; \u2022Replenishment and allocation systems; \u2022Merchandising presentation and inventory management tools; \u2022Warehouse and transportation management systems;  \u2022Labor management tools for stores and supply chain; \u2022Price optimization system; \u2022Vendor purchase order control system; \u2022Human resource information systems; \u2022Business intelligence and analytics tools; and  \u2022Customer loyalty and campaign management system.   5 5 5 Index Index  These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system.  This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.  We continue to invest in technology to support store, online, and distribution facility expansion and our long-term strategic growth initiatives focused heavily on improving the customer experience across all channels.  We also continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness.\u00a0 Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes, and upgrades to support optimal software configurations, and application performance.  We plan to continue to invest in information technology and implement efficiency-driving system enhancements such as in-store mobility, labor and task management tools, and back-office support systems.  We will continue to evaluate the use of technologies to improve productivity such as artificial intelligence, automation software, quantum computing, edge computing, and other technologies.  We also maintain and continue to strengthen the security of our information systems to help protect and prevent unauthorized access to personal information of our customers, team members, vendors, and other confidential Company data.  We are endeavoring to adhere to quickly evolving industry privacy laws and standards.  Critical areas of focus include cloud, end point protection and privacy.  Collectively, these efforts are directed toward improving business processes, maintaining secure, efficient, and stable systems, and enabling the continued growth and success of our business.  Petsense by Tractor Supply  Petsense by Tractor Supply is a small-box pet specialty supply retailer focused on meeting the needs of pet owners, primarily in small and mid-sized communities, and offering a variety of pet products and services.  At December\u00a031, 2022, we operated a total of 186 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in 23 states, with approximately 700 full-time and 900 part-time team members, and an e-commerce website (Petsense.com). The Petsense name is registered with the USPTO.  Human Capital  We believe that our team members are the foundation of our business and that their hard work, passion, commitment, and experience drive our success.  As a result of our commitment to our team members, for the third consecutive year, we were recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as a \u201cGreat Place to Work-Certified\u201d company.

Below are further descriptions of our Company and our focus on the development and support of our team members:  Management and Team Members  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we employed approximately 24,000 full-time and 25,000 part-time Tractor Supply team members.  We typically employ additional part-time team members throughout the year during high sales volume periods.\u00a0 We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.  Eligible team members can participate in one of our various bonus incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon individual, team, and/or Company performance.

We plan to open approximately 70 new Tractor Supply and 10 to 15 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in fiscal 2023, a selling square footage increase of approximately 3%.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, we plan to rebrand all 81 Orscheln stores to Tractor Supply stores in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2022, we opened 63 new Tractor Supply stores and nine new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores, and acquired 81 Orscheln Farm and Home stores.  In fiscal 2021, we opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores and seven new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. This represents a selling square footage increase of approximately 11% during fiscal 2022 and 4% during fiscal 2021.   At December\u00a031, 2022, we operated 2,333 retail stores in 49 states (2,066 Tractor Supply retail stores, 186 Petsense by Tractor Supply retail stores, and 81 Orscheln Farm and Home retail stores set to be rebranded to Tractor Supply retail stores by the end of 2023). Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets. We believe we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have significant additional opportunities for new Tractor Supply stores. We also believe that there is opportunity for continued growth for Petsense by Tractor Supply stores.    Approximately 59% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 41% are located in shopping centers. We lease approximately 95% of our stores and own the remaining 5%.  In addition to new store expansion, we will continue to support our strategic growth through expansion of our distribution network and initiatives including, among others, space productivity and Side Lot improvements in certain existing stores as well as continued improvements in technology and infrastructure at our existing stores, and ongoing investments to enhance our digital and omni-channel capabilities to better serve our customers.  Competition  We operate in a competitive retail industry. We believe the principal competitive factors include location of stores, fulfillment options, price, quality of merchandise, in-stock inventory consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, product knowledge, and customer service. We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, pet retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.\u00a0\u00a0However, we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.  See further discussion of competition in 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Seasonality and Weather  Our business is seasonal. \u00a0Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.  We usually experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season, and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold-weather selling season.  We believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves, not the quarters, due to the fact that different weather patterns from year-to-year can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters, particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters.   Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have unfavorably affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations. In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain, and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and duration of these conditions.  Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.   8 8 8 Index Index Stewardship and Compliance with Environmental Matters  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, enacted or adopted, regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.\u00a0 We are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.\u00a0 We are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company.\u00a0 This commitment is demonstrated through our Stewardship Program, which is our environmental sustainability program.\u00a0 Through this program, the Company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment.\u00a0 These initiatives include the installation of energy management systems, LED lighting, high efficiency heating/air conditioning systems, and recycling programs in our stores, distribution facilities, and Store Support Center. Our Store Support Center and our distribution centers in Casa Grande, Arizona, and Frankfort, New York are LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certified for environmentally sustainable design, construction, and operation.\u00a0 We also installed solar arrays at the Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee, and our Tractor Supply store in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The Company also opened its ninth distribution center in Navarre, Ohio on January 18, 2023. The distribution center is the first Tractor Supply facility built to LEED Gold standards. The facility features a rooftop solar array system consisting of more than 10,000 solar panels that will produce five megawatts of electricity per year, which will satisfy the electricity needs, and will utilize electric fork trucks powered by lithium-ion batteries to pick and move inventory.  The Company has been a SmartWay Transport partner since 2013.  SmartWay Transport is a public-private initiative between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, large and small trucking companies, retailers, and other federal and state agencies.  Its purpose is to improve fuel efficiency and the environmental performance (reduction of both greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution) of supply chains.  In December 2018, we announced a goal to reduce carbon emissions from our facilities by 25% by 2025 from our 2015 baseline as part of the Company's Stewardship Program.  In December 2020, we announced that we had reached this goal five years early.    On December 15, 2022, we released our 2021 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures Report, following the announcement of our goal in September 2021 to reduce our carbon footprint by 20% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero missions across all operations by 2040. In the report, we discussed our approach to evaluating and managing climate change risks and identifying opportunities. We also detailed the next phase of our sustainability journey, including increasing efforts to procure renewable energy, continuing investments in energy efficiency and cleaner technologies, avoiding future emissions through better design of both stores and distribution centers, and refining our Scope 3 emissions through our new supplier engagement program with the intent to reduce value chain emissions.
