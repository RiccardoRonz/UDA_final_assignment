{"cik": 55785, "item_1A": "ITEM\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS Kimberly-Clark Corporation was founded in 1872 and incorporated in Delaware in 1928. We are a global company focused on delivering products and solutions that provide better care for a better world through product innovation and building our personal care, consumer tissue and K-C Professional\u00a0brands.  We are principally engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of a wide range of products mostly made from natural or synthetic fibers using advanced technologies in fibers, nonwovens and absorbency.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms \"Corporation,\" \"Kimberly-Clark,\" \"K-C,\" \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" refer to Kimberly-Clark Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.  Description of Kimberly-Clark We are organized into operating segments based on product groupings.  These operating segments have been aggregated into three reportable global business segments as follows:  \u2022Personal Care brands offer our consumers a trusted partner in caring for themselves and their families by delivering confidence, protection and discretion through a wide variety of innovative solutions and products such as disposable diapers, training and youth pants, swimpants, baby wipes, feminine and incontinence care products, reusable underwear and other related products.\u00a0 Products in this segment are sold under the Huggies, Pull-Ups, Little Swimmers, GoodNites, DryNites, Sweety, Kotex, U by Kotex, Intimus, Thinx, Poise, Depend, Plenitud, Softex and other brand names. \u2022Consumer Tissue offers a wide variety of innovative solutions and trusted brands that responsibly improve everyday living for families around the world.\u00a0 Products in this segment include facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products, and are sold under the Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, Andrex, Viva, Scottex, Neve and other brand names. \u2022K-C Professional partners with businesses to create Exceptional Workplaces, helping to make them healthier, safer and more productive through a range of solutions and supporting products such as wipers, tissue, towels, apparel, soaps and sanitizers.  Our brands, including Kleenex, Scott, WypAll, Kimtech and KleenGuard are well known for quality and trusted to help people around the world work better. These reportable segments were determined in accordance with how our chief operating decision maker and our executive managers develop and execute our global strategies to drive growth and profitability of our personal care, consumer tissue and K-C Professional operations.  These strategies include global plans for branding and product positioning, technology, research and development programs, cost reductions including supply chain management and capacity, and capital investments for each of these businesses.  Products for household use are sold directly to supermarkets, mass merchandisers, drugstores, warehouse clubs, variety and department stores and other retail outlets, as well as through other distributors and e-commerce.  Products for away-from-home use are sold through distributors, directly to manufacturing, lodging, office building, food service, and high-volume public facilities, and through e-commerce. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 13 percent in 2022, 14 percent in 2021 and 15 percent in 2020 of our consolidated net sales.  Net sales to Walmart Inc. were primarily in the Personal Care and Consumer Tissue segments. On February 24, 2022, we completed our acquisition of a majority and controlling share of Thinx Inc. (\u201cThinx\u201d), an industry leader in the reusable period and incontinence underwear category, for total consideration of $181 consisting of cash of $53, the fair value of our previously held equity investment of $127, and certain share-based award costs of $1.  See Item 8, Note\u00a03 to the consolidated financial statements for details on the Thinx acquisition. On October 24, 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Neve tissue brand and related consumer and K-C Professional tissue assets in Brazil for $175, subject to certain working capital and other closing adjustments.  The transaction also includes a licensing agreement to allow the acquirer to manufacture and market in Brazil the Kleenex, Scott and Wypall brands to consumers and away-from-home customers for a period of time.  The transaction is pending customary conditions and  1KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report 1KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report  1KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report 1 KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report   regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of 2023.  The assets included in the sale agreement have been reclassified to Other current assets as of December 31, 2022. Patents and Trademarks We own various patents and trademarks registered domestically and in many foreign countries.  We consider the patents and trademarks that we own and the trademarks under which we sell certain of our products to be material to our business.  Consequently, we seek patent and trademark protection by all available means, including registration. Raw Materials Cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or fiber recycled from recovered waste paper, is the primary raw material for our tissue products, and in the form of fluff pulp, is a component of disposable diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads and incontinence care products. Polypropylene and other synthetics and chemicals are the primary raw materials for manufacturing nonwoven fabrics, which are used in disposable diapers, training and youth pants, wet wipes, feminine pads, incontinence care products, and away-from-home wipers and apparel.  Superabsorbent materials are important components of disposable diapers, training and youth pants and incontinence care products.  Raw materials are purchased from third parties, and we consider the supply to be adequate to meet the needs of our businesses.  See Item\u00a01A, \"Risk Factors.\" Competition We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which are larger and more diversified than us.  The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities.  For additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we conduct our business, see Item\u00a01A, \"Risk Factors.\" Foreign Market Risks We operate and market our products globally, and our business strategy includes targeted growth in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  See Item\u00a01A, \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion of foreign market risks that may affect our financial results. Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Better care for a better world begins with working to ensure the health and safety of our customers, consumers, and employees, promoting inclusion, equity and diversity within our business, and making efforts to protect the rights of workers across our supply chain.  We also believe we can make meaningful contributions to gender equality, clean water and sanitation, climate action and responsible consumption and production.  Our sustainability strategy puts our brand, supply chain and innovation teams to work with the goal of creating shared value by addressing global challenges and is focused on addressing impactful climate-related risks and opportunities throughout our value chain.  We are committed to making lives better while working to safeguard the earth\u2019s natural systems.  We implement this commitment by considering our sustainability goals during our business and capital planning processes, aligning the priorities of our supply chain, brand and innovation teams, and establishing meaningful performance indicators.  Our environmental priorities include reducing our use of new fossil fuel-based plastic, while enabling circular systems to recover the materials in our products and packaging; reducing our products\u2019 use of natural forest fiber, while protecting forest biodiversity and supporting forest dependent communities; reducing greenhouse gas emissions along our value chain, with goals approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (\"SBTi\"); and building resilience to water risk at our facilities and in our communities in water-stressed regions around the world.  The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals are accepted as the best shared definition of what needs to be done over the next decade, and we have aligned our goals with that framework.  Progress on our strategy is outlined in our sustainability and Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosure (\"TCFD\") reports. 2KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report 2KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report  2KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report 2 KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report   For 2023 and 2024, we expect total capital expenditures for voluntary environmental controls or controls necessary to comply with legal requirements relating to the protection of the environment at our facilities to be approximately $45 and $55, respectively.  Total operating expenses for environmental compliance, including pollution control equipment operation and maintenance costs, governmental fees, and research and engineering costs, are expected to be approximately $115 in 2023 and $100 in 2024. Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses are not expected to have a material effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, consolidated earnings or competitive position.  Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans or changes in legal requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change or other factors. Regulatory Compliance We are subject to many laws and regulations across all the countries in which we do business, and we are particularly impacted by those relating to product safety, environmental protection and data privacy and protection. We are obligated to comply with regulations that cover product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting.  These include requirements that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers of risks of using our products.  In some cases, it may be necessary to initiate product recalls if safety risks are considered to exist.  All our facilities and other operations are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater.  We are also subject to various laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), Brazil's General Data Protection Law (\"LGPD\"), China's Personal Information Protection Law (\"PIPL\"), and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\").  Our policy is to abide by all applicable laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place to manage global compliance with these various requirements.  We monitor each of these areas for new or changed regulatory requirements, particularly in the rapidly evolving area of data privacy and protection.  We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations; however, total capital expenditures and operating expenses related to compliance are not expected to have a material effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, consolidated earnings or competitive position.   Human Capital Management We had approximately 44,000 employees as of December 31, 2022 in our consolidated operations.  Approximately 30 percent of our employees were located in North America and the remainder were in approximately 60 countries outside of North America.  Overall, approximately 60 percent of our workforce was directly involved in manufacturing and distribution operations. In order to recruit, retain, develop, protect and fairly compensate our employees, we focus on four key areas: inclusion, equity and diversity, health and safety, development and employee engagement, and compensation and benefits. \u2022Inclusion, equity and diversity \u2013 We believe our business success is intricately tied to creating workplaces, communities and experiences where inclusion, equity and diversity are evident and thriving.  We prioritize the need to cultivate a workforce where all are included and empowered to do their best work.  Employing people from disparate backgrounds, cultures, and experiences amplifies our ability to gather insights, foster innovation and understand the culture, context, and mindset of consumers around the world.  As a company who serves consumers and communities, we work to cultivate a workforce comprised of people who look, think, and behave like the people who use our products \u2013 now and in the future.  As such, we support workforce inclusion, equity and diversity and consider it a fundamental business strategy.  We continue to make progress on our short-and long-term goals for women and U.S. People of Color in all management roles.  The Management Development and Compensation Committee (\u201cMDC\u201d) of the Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing our inclusion, equity and diversity strategy and related metrics.   \u2022Health and safety  \u2013 We are committed to the health and safety of our employees.  We create and administer company-wide policies and processes designed to protect our employees and to comply with applicable safety regulations.  Health and safety training is regularly provided to our employees.  We review and monitor our performance closely to drive continuous improvement in our safety programs.  3KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report 3KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report  3KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report 3 KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2022 Annual Report   In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented additional workplace safety programs and processes in all our facilities.  As the circumstances and impacts of COVID-19 evolve, we continue to evaluate our response and adapt to protect the health and safety of our employees. \u2022Development and employee engagement \u2013 Developing talent and leaders at all levels of the organization and engaging our employees is critical to our long-term success.  We maintain talent and succession planning processes and have leadership and management development programs as well as broad learning opportunities for all employees to support their career growth and advance their skills. We also offer employees the opportunity to join Employee Resource Groups (\"ERGs\"). These groups foster professional development, social connectivity, and celebrate diversity throughout our company.  Current ERGs provide community and insights into the perspectives and experiences of those with African, Hispanic, Latino, and Asian ancestry, women, and LGBTQ+, as well as parents, caregivers, people with disabilities, military veterans, and new employees.  Our ERGs promote career development by allowing employees to connect with and learn from one another and help amplify our inclusion, equity and diversity efforts. Further, in regard to employee engagement, we hold regular Town Hall meetings where employees can ask questions of executives and make their voice heard.  We also host global conversations about racism, bias and other important topics.  We engage in continuous listening via global surveys, on an ongoing basis, that offer our employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential issues and identify opportunities to improve and support employee engagement.  \u2022Compensation and benefits \u2013 We provide market-based competitive compensation through our salary, annual incentive and long-term incentive programs and robust benefits packages that promote employee well-being across all aspects of their lives.  Eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to our goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives.  We also provide a variety of resources and services to help our employees plan for retirement.  We believe the structure of our compensation packages provides the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. The MDC is responsible for establishing and administering the policies governing annual compensation and long-term compensation to ensure that the policies are designed to align compensation with our overall business strategy and performance.
