{"cik": 712515, "item_1A": "Item 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business Overview Electronic Arts is a global leader in digital interactive entertainment. We develop, market, publish and deliver games, content and services that can be experienced on game consoles, PCs, mobile phones and tablets. What We Offer At our core is a portfolio of intellectual property from which we create innovative games and experiences that deliver high-quality entertainment and drive engagement across our network of hundreds of millions of unique active accounts. Our portfolio includes brands that we either wholly own (such as Apex Legends, Battlefield, and The Sims) or license from others (such as Madden NFL, Star Wars, and the 300+ licenses within our global football ecosystem). We are focusing on building games and experiences that grow the global online communities around our key franchises; reaching more players through connecting interactive storytelling to key intellectual property; and building re-occurring revenue from our annualized sports franchises, our console, PC and mobile catalog titles, and our live services. We develop and publish games and services across diverse genres, such as sports, racing, first-person shooter, action, role-playing and simulation. We believe that our portfolio, talent, live services offerings, use of multiple business models and distribution channels, and network of hundreds of millions of unique active accounts provide us with strategic advantages.  Revenue from our global football franchise, which is consistently one of the top franchises in the marketplace and includes the annualized console, PC and mobile games, as well as FIFA Ultimate Team, is material to our business and will continue to be so. Starting in fiscal year 2024, our global football franchise will transition to a new EA SPORTS FC brand. Our vision for the future of interactive football with EA SPORTS FC is to create the largest football club in the world, and we believe this is the right opportunity for us so that we can continue delivering innovation and growing to connect more fans on a global scale.   Live services net revenue, particularly extra content net revenue, has been material to our business, and we expect it to continue to be so. Through our live services offerings, we offer our players high-quality experiences designed to provide value to players and extend and enhance gameplay. These live services include extra content, subscription offerings and other revenue generated outside of the sale of our base games. Our digital live services and other net revenue represented 74 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2023. Our most popular live services are the extra content purchased for the Ultimate Team mode associated with our sports franchises and extra content purchased for our Apex Legends franchise. Ultimate Team allows players to collect current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team. Live services net revenue generated from extra content purchased within Ultimate Team, a substantial portion of which was derived from FIFA Ultimate Team, and for our Apex Legends franchise, is material to our business.  We believe that we can add value to our network by making it easier for players to connect by offering choices of business model, distribution channel and device. Our games and services can be experienced on consoles, PCs, mobile phones, tablets, and reach our players through both digital distribution channels and retail channels. Players can access our games and services through traditional single-game purchase or through subscription offerings; and certain of our games and services are available through a \u201cfree-to-play\u201d model whereby players download the game for free and engage with services provided on an ongoing basis. For example, we develop products and services within our global football franchise that allow players to engage through  3 3 3 Table of Contents Table of Contents       multiple business models, distribution channels and devices, including: (1) our annualized console and PC games and associated services, which can be purchased through both digital distribution and retail channels and also is available through subscription services; (2) a mobile free-to-play offering; and (3) a PC free-to-play game available in certain countries. Digitally, our console games and live services can be purchased through third-party storefronts, such as the digital stores of our console partners. Our direct sales to Sony and Microsoft represented approximately 32 percent and 16 percent of total net revenue, respectively, in fiscal year 2023. Our mobile and tablet games and services are available through third-party application storefronts such as the Apple App Store and Google Play. Our PC games and services can be downloaded directly through the EA app, EA\u2019s digital storefront, as well as through third-party online download stores, such as Steam. We also partner with third parties to publish our mobile and PC games and services in certain Asian territories, such as our partnerships with Tencent Holdings Limited for FIFA Online in China and Nexon Co. Ltd. for FIFA Online in Korea. From time to time, third parties will publish games and services under a license to certain of our intellectual property assets. We also offer our EA Play subscription service on consoles and PC. EA Play allows players access to a selection of our console and PC games and services for a monthly or annual fee. Our packaged goods games are sold directly to mass market retailers, specialty stores and through distribution arrangements. New distribution methods and business models are expected to continue to emerge in the future, and we intend to evaluate these opportunities on a case-by-case basis. We believe that the future of entertainment is interactive and that the consumption of entertainment and sports is deeply social. We are investing towards a future of accelerated content generation and increased player engagement - with players across our network using games to stay connected to friends, and to express themselves. While we continue to anchor our business on delivering amazing content and services to more players, our goal is to build from our core and invest in new areas of opportunity.  Significant Relationships Sony & Microsoft. Under the terms of publishing agreements we have entered into with Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC and its affiliates and with Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates, we are authorized to develop, market, publish, and distribute disc-based products and services, and we authorize Sony and Microsoft to distribute our digital products and services, compatible with PlayStation and Xbox consoles, respectively. Under these agreements with Sony and Microsoft, we have the non-exclusive right to use, for a fixed term and in a designated territory, technology that is owned or licensed by them to publish our games on their respective consoles. With respect to our digitally-delivered products and services, the console manufacturers pay us either a wholesale price or a royalty percentage on the revenue they derive from their sales of our products and services. Our transactions for packaged goods products are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, which are accepted on a case-by case basis by Sony or Microsoft (or their designated replicators), as the case may be. For packaged goods products, we pay the console manufacturers a per-unit royalty for each unit manufactured. Many key commercial terms of our relationships with Sony and Microsoft \u2014 such as manufacturing terms, delivery times, policies and approval conditions \u2014 are determined unilaterally, and are subject to change by the console manufacturers. The publishing agreements also require us to indemnify the console manufacturers for any loss, liability and expense resulting from any claim against the console manufacturer regarding our games and services, including any claims for patent, copyright or trademark infringement brought against the console manufacturer. Each agreement may be terminated by the console manufacturer if a breach or default by us is not cured after we receive written notice from the console manufacturer, or if we become insolvent. The console manufacturers are not obligated to enter into license agreements with us for any future consoles, products or services. Apple, Google and Other App Stores. We have agreements to distribute our mobile applications and additional content through distributors such as Apple and Google. Our applications are downloaded for mobile devices from third party application storefronts. The distributor collects payment from consumers for content purchased within the application or charges consumers a one-time fee to download the application. Our distribution agreements establish the amounts that are retained by the distributor and the amounts passed through to us. These arrangements are typically terminable on short notice. The agreements generally do not obligate the distributors to market or distribute any of our applications. Application storefront policies are determined unilaterally by the distributors and are subject to change.  Publishing Partners in Asia. We have entered into agreements whereby we partner with certain companies, including Tencent Holdings Limited, Nexon Co., Ltd and Garena Online Private Limited. or their respective affiliates, pursuant to which these companies publish our mobile and PC free-to-play games in certain countries, including China, Korea and certain countries in Southeast Asia. Our players access games from the publishers\u2019 online storefronts and are charged for additional content  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents       purchased within our game environment. The agreements generally establish the amounts that are retained by the publisher, and the amounts passed through to us.  Competition The market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products, business models and distribution channels are introduced. We also face competition for the right to use certain intellectual property included in our products. In order to remain successful, we are required to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, the ways in which our products and services will compete in the market. We face significant competition from companies that focus on developing games and services available on consoles, PCs and/or mobile devices. In addition, the convergence of the gaming, technology/internet, social networking and entertainment industries in recent years has brought us into more direct competition with larger, well-funded technology companies. These companies have strengthened their interactive entertainment capabilities, and we expect them to continue to do so. Their greater financial and other resources may provide larger budgets to develop and market tools, technologies, products and services that gain consumer success and shift player time and engagement away from our products and services. We also continue to expect new entrants to emerge.  More broadly, we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment, such as movies, television, online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time. Important competitive factors in our industry include the ability to attract creative and technical talent, game quality and ease of use, innovation, compatibility of products with certain consoles and other distribution channels, brand recognition, reputation, reliability, security, creativity, price, marketing, and quality of customer service. In the past several years, our industry has undergone a period of increased consolidation which increases competitive pressure on us as interactive entertainment companies grow through acquisition or as larger, well-funded technology companies strengthen their interactive entertainment capabilities.  Risks related to competitive factors affecting our business are described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.  Research and Development  Because the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully is linked to our ability to deliver a flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. We have teams focused on developing new technologies, such as self-learning artificial intelligence for our games, to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of our offerings.   Intellectual Property and Technology To establish and protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, patents, patent applications, trade secrets, know-how, license agreements, confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions. We actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, but the laws of some countries in which we operate, particularly in Asia, either do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States or are poorly enforced. As our digital business has grown, our games and services increasingly depend on the reliability, availability and security of our technological infrastructure. Our industry is prone to, and our systems and networks are subject to actions by malfeasant actors, such as cyber-attacks and other information security incidents, including ransomware attacks. While we devote financial and operational resources to implement systems, processes and technologies to guard against cyber events and to help protect our intellectual property, employee and consumer data and information technology systems against intrusions or other security breaches, we have experienced such events in the past and expect future events to occur. In addition, we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services, including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and re-balancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered. Governmental Regulation We are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally, including laws and regulations related to gaming, user privacy, data collection and retention, consumer protection, protection of minors, online safety, content, advertising, localization, information security, intellectual property, competition, sanctions, addressing climate change, taxation, and employment, among others. Many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing, and the application to, and impact on, us is uncertain. Certain of our business models are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations. The growth and development of  5 5 5 Table of Contents Table of Contents       electronic commerce, virtual items and virtual currency has prompted calls for new laws and regulations and resulted in the application of existing laws or regulations that have limited or restricted the sale of our products and services in certain territories. Seasonality We have historically experienced the highest percentage of our net bookings in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonal holiday demand and the launch timing of our games. While we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2024, there is no assurance that it will. Human Capital Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and services. As of March 31, 2023, we employed approximately 13,400 people globally, with 65 percent located internationally. Our Board and its committees oversee our human capital management programs, practices and strategies and additional information on how they oversee these matters can be found in our annual Proxy Statement. We\u2019re committed to (1) integrating diversity, equity and inclusion in our people practices to drive results, (2) a safe, healthy and supportive culture that prioritizes engagement, listening and action, and (3) inclusive talent practices to support the development of our people and the growth of our business.   Our most recently published Company-wide gender and racial/ethnic representation, as well as our EEO-1 report (U.S. government reporting), are available on our website. Our commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion extend to compensating our employees fairly based on the work that they perform. We consider our pay equity philosophy at each stage at which compensation decisions are made, including when hiring and promoting employees and through our annual review cycle. In addition, we annually partner with an independent outside firm to review employees\u2019 pay and promote fairness in our compensation philosophy and practices.  We are committed to the development and growth of the next generation of diverse talent through community outreach and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education. Substantially all of our hiring includes diverse candidates in the initial pool, and we go further by setting aspirational targets for the inclusion of candidates from underrepresented communities at later stages of the recruiting process that we believe can lead to better outcomes. We consistently hire underrepresented talent above our current representation rates.   We aim to create a work environment and culture in which our people can do their best work. We aim to build a reciprocal relationship in which we engage, listen, respond, and work together to create a culture that supports our people and delivers on our business goals. All regular, full-time employees are asked to complete an Engagement Survey twice per year. 77 percent of employees participated in our most recent Engagement Survey, conducted in December 2022. We also conduct regular manager surveys. Results of all employee surveys are evaluated and inform opportunities for further improvement in our people practices.   We invest in developing and retaining employees through access to professional growth resources, skills learning, and other job-specific and general training. We also build technical onboarding and job-specific programs to help our employees onboard to technical roles and grow in their specific domains. We maintain resources, programs and services to support employees' physical, mental, familial and financial health. We offer a wide range of benefits, such as comprehensive health insurance and time-off and leave programs, including specialized programs around key life events.  We also design ways to collaborate across work models, whether working virtually, on-site, or using a hybrid approach. We empower leadership to determine the most appropriate workplace strategy for their teams, intended to facilitate productivity and engagement and deliver on business priorities.
