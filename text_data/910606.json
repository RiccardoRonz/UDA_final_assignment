Business Regency Centers Corporation is a fully integrated real estate company and self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust that began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993.

Attract, retain, and engage an exceptional and diverse team that is guided by our values while fostering an environment of innovation and continuous improvement. Competition We are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the USA based on revenues, number of properties, GLA, and market capitalization.  There are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that own shopping centers and also anchor some of our shopping centers.  This results in competition for attracting tenants as well as acquiring existing shopping centers and new development sites.  In addition, brick and mortar shopping centers face continued competition from alternative shopping and delivery methods.  We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by: \u2022the market areas in which we operate, and the locations of our shopping centers within those market areas; the market areas in which we operate, and the locations of our shopping centers within those market areas; \u2022the design of our shopping centers including our strategy of maintaining and renovating these centers to our high standards of quality; the design of our shopping centers including our strategy of maintaining and renovating these centers to our high standards of quality; \u2022the compelling demographics surrounding our shopping centers; the compelling demographics surrounding our shopping centers; \u2022our relationships with our anchor, shop, and out-parcel tenants; our relationships with our anchor, shop, and out-parcel tenants; \u2022our management experience and expertise; and our management experience and expertise; and \u2022our ability to successfully develop, redevelop, and acquire shopping centers. our ability to successfully develop, redevelop, and acquire shopping centers. 2 \u00a0 Corporate Responsibility and Human Capital While executing our mission, we strive to achieve best-in-class corporate responsibility.  Corporate responsibility, including our focus on ESG practices, is a foundational strategy of Regency.  We believe that alignment of strategy and sustainable outcomes is critical to the long-term success of our Company, our shareholders, and the environment.  Our ESG practices are built on four pillars: \u2022Our People; Our People; \u2022Our Communities; Our Communities; \u2022Ethics and Governance; and Ethics and Governance; and \u2022Environmental Stewardship. Environmental Stewardship. These practices are guided by three overarching concepts: long-term value creation, our Regency brand and reputation, and the importance of maintaining our culture.  Our continued commitment to these concepts guides our business strategy and helps us identify and address key corporate responsibility-related matters. We regularly review our corporate responsibility (which term we use interchangeably with \"ESG\") strategies, goals, and objectives with our Board of Directors and its committees, which oversee our programs.  More information about our corporate responsibility strategy, goals, performance, and reporting, including our annual Corporate Responsibility report, our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\") report, and our policies and practices related to corporate responsibility, is available on our website at www.regencycenters.com.  The content of our website and other information contained therein, including relating to corporate responsibility, is not incorporated by reference into this Report or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only. Our People \u2013 Our people are our most important asset, and we strive to ensure that they are engaged, passionate about their work, connected to their teams, and supported to deliver their best performance.  Regency recognizes and values the importance of attracting and retaining talented individuals with different skills, backgrounds, and experiences to encourage diversity of thoughts and ideas.  In addition, we strive to maintain a safe and healthy workspace, promote employee well-being, and empower our employees by focusing on their personal and professional development through training and education opportunities.  As of December 31, 2022, we had 445 employees, including 5 part-time employees.  We presently maintain 22 market offices nationwide, including our corporate headquarters in Jacksonville, Florida.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.  In 2022, we continued implementing our comprehensive, multi-year diversity, equity, and inclusion (\"DEI\") strategy focused on promoting and advancing diversity across our organization, enabling our employees to grow and succeed, and supporting social justice initiatives in our operations and broader communities.  Furthermore, aligned with our near-and long-term human capital goals, we remained focused on employee engagement, leveraging our annual employee survey to identify opportunities to improve and further engage our people.  Additionally, we continued to develop our employees and look for new opportunities to ensure we attract and retain our most important assets: our people. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - We believe that much of our success is rooted in the diversity and inclusion of our teams and our commitment to a diverse and inclusive culture.  We value diversity at all levels and focus on extending our DEI initiatives across our workforce.  We continue to foster a culture in which everyone is respected, valued, and has an equal opportunity to contribute and thrive.  Our commitment is unwavering, and we remain focused on building a workforce that represents the many customers we serve and the communities in which we operate.  Our most recent U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEO-1 survey data can be found on our website, including additional information related to employee gender and ethnic diversity.  Human Rights \u2013 Regency is committed to a workplace free from discrimination and harassment and is focused on advancing fundamental human rights.  Anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training is provided to all employees at orientation, and annually thereafter.  Talent Attraction and Retention \u2013 Our core values place a strong importance on our people, which we believe makes us an employer of choice.  We understand the importance of attracting and retaining the best talent to build long-term value.  We strive to offer some of the most competitive pay and benefits in the industry in which we operate and are continually looking for new opportunities to ensure that we attract and retain our people.  3 \u00a0 Training and Development\u2013 We strive to provide an environment where our people are connected to their teams, passionate about what they do, and supported to deliver their best efforts and results.  From individual contributors to managers and senior leaders, we want to empower our employees to take control of their career growth and realize their full potential through meaningful training and development opportunities. Health, Safety, and Well-Being \u2013 The safety, health, and well-being of our people are a top priority for Regency.  We strive to provide a benefit package that is comprehensive, competitive, and thoughtfully designed to attract and retain the best in the business.  We prioritize employee safety at our centers and offices, and require contractors working at our sites to engage in safe work practices.  Our Communities \u2013 Our predominately grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers provide many benefits to the communities in which we live and work, including significant local economic impacts in the form of investment, jobs, and taxes.  Our local teams are passionate about investing in and engaging with our communities as they customize and cultivate our centers to create a distinctive environment to bring our tenants and shoppers together for the best retail experience.  We believe philanthropy and charitable giving are important elements of our corporate responsibility commitment.  Throughout 2022, Regency supported its employees to serve and invest in community organizations through volunteer and financial support.  Charitable contributions were made directly by the Company, as well as by the vast majority of our employees who donated their time and money to local non-profits directly serving their communities.  Furthermore, as part of our strategy, we continued to improve our communities by investing in property enhancements and placemaking at our new and existing shopping centers.  Ethics and Governance \u2013 As long-term stewards of our investors\u2019 capital, we are committed to best-in-class corporate governance.  To create long-term value for our stakeholders, we place great emphasis on our culture and core values, the integrity and transparency of our reporting practices, and our overall governance structure in respect of oversight and shareholder rights.  To achieve the right mix of skills, experience, backgrounds, tenures, and competencies, including diversity in terms of gender, ethnic background, age, and other attributes, Regency\u2019s board of directors annually reviews its overall board composition.  In 2022, Regency announced the appointment of Kristin A. Campbell to our board of directors, effective January 15, 2023. Mrs. Campbell\u2019s appointment aligns with Regency\u2019s ongoing commitment to board refreshment and best-in-class corporate governance.  Environmental Stewardship \u2013 We believe sustainability is in the best interest of our investors, tenants, employees, and the communities in which we operate, and we strive to integrate sustainable practices throughout our business.  We have seven strategic priorities for identifying and implementing sustainable business practices and minimizing our environmental impact: green building, energy efficiency, renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions (\"GHG\") reduction, water conservation, waste management, and climate change analysis.  We believe these strategic priorities are not only the right thing to do to address environmental concerns such as air pollution, climate change, and resource scarcity but also support us in achieving key strategic objectives in our operations and development projects.  During 2022, we remained committed to measuring and reducing our GHG emissions.  Earlier in the year, we refined our strategy and elevated our commitment by aligning our goals with the Science Based Targets initiative (\"SBTi\").  We have committed to reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 28% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, endorsed by the SBTi, and to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions across all operations by 2050.  Concurrently, we announced new near-and long-term goals to demonstrate our commitment to environmental sustainability as described in our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report.  Based on our current estimates and asset base, we do not expect these commitments to materially impact our operating results and financial condition.  As a long-term owner, operator, and developer of real estate, we acknowledge the potential for climate change to have a material impact on our properties, people, and long-term success.  Regency wants to ensure that our properties can safely, sustainably, and responsibly withstand the test of time.  We continue to refine our understanding of our exposure to climate-related impacts by conducting ongoing property-level analysis.  We continue our efforts to understand and address the risks that climate change may pose to our business. Compliance with Governmental Regulations We are subject to various regulatory and tax-related requirements within the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Changes to such requirements may result in unanticipated material financial impacts or adverse tax consequences and could materially affect our operating results and financial condition.  Significant regulatory requirements include the laws and regulations described below. \u00a0 4 \u00a0 REIT Laws and Regulations We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the federal income tax laws.  As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.  Under the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), REITs are subject to numerous regulatory requirements, including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90% of taxable income each year.  We will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income.  We will also generally not qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost.  Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. We have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRS\").  In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Code.  A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes which, to date, have not been material to us. Environmental Laws and Regulations Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to assess and remediate certain hazardous substances at our shopping centers.  To the extent any environmental issues arise, they most typically stem from the historic practices of current and former dry cleaners, gas stations, and other similar businesses at our centers, as well as the presence of asbestos in some structures.  These requirements often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or committed the acts or omissions that caused the presence of the hazardous substances.  The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly address contamination caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral.  Although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of assessment and remediation, known environmental liabilities are not currently expected to have a material impact on our financial condition.

Annual Meeting of Shareholders Our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders is currently expected to be held on Wednesday, May 3, 2023, and will be conducted in a virtual-only format to the extent permitted by applicable law. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the required Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") presentations, we use and report certain non-GAAP measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results.  We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.  Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.  We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change. We do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders.  The principal limitation of these non-GAAP measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management's judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP measures.  In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided.  Non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects of the Company. Defined Terms The following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results, and are included in this document: \u2022Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure we use because the computation of Nareit Funds from Operations (\"Nareit FFO\") includes certain non-comparable items that affect our period-over-period performance.  Core Operating Earnings excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses, (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt, (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market debt adjustments, and (iv) other amounts as they occur.  We provide reconciliations of both Net income attributable to common stockholders to Nareit FFO and Nareit FFO to Core Operating Earnings. Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure we use because the computation of Nareit Funds from Operations (\"Nareit FFO\") includes certain non-comparable items that affect our period-over-period performance.  Core Operating Earnings excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses, (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt, (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market debt adjustments, and (iv) other amounts as they occur.  We provide reconciliations of both Net income attributable to common stockholders to Nareit FFO and Nareit FFO to Core Operating Earnings. \u2022Development Completion is a Property in Development that is deemed complete upon the earlier of: (i) 90% of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95%, or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations.  Once deemed complete, the property is termed a Retail Operating Property. Development Completion is a Property in Development that is deemed complete upon the earlier of: (i) 90% of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95%, or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations.  Once deemed complete, the property is termed a Retail Operating Property. \u2022Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined as Operating EBITDAre divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders. Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined as Operating EBITDAre divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders. 6 \u00a0 \u2022Nareit EBITDAre is a measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) gains on sales of real estate, (v) impairments of real estate, and (vi) adjustments to reflect the Company's share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Nareit EBITDAre is a measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) gains on sales of real estate, (v) impairments of real estate, and (vi) adjustments to reflect the Company's share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  \u2022Nareit Funds from Operations (\"Nareit FFO\") is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which Nareit defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sales and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We compute Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition. Nareit Funds from Operations (\"Nareit FFO\") is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which Nareit defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sales and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We compute Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition. Companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions.  Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sale and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs.  This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations.  We provide a reconciliation of Net income attributable to common stockholders to Nareit FFO. \u2022Net Operating Income (\"NOI\") is the sum of base rent, percentage rent, recoveries from tenants, other lease income, and other property income, less operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, ground rent, and uncollectible lease income.  NOI excludes straight-line rental income and expense, above and below market rent and ground rent amortization, tenant lease inducement amortization, and other fees.  We also provide disclosure of NOI excluding termination fees, which excludes both termination fee income and expenses. Net Operating Income (\"NOI\") is the sum of base rent, percentage rent, recoveries from tenants, other lease income, and other property income, less operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, ground rent, and uncollectible lease income.  NOI excludes straight-line rental income and expense, above and below market rent and ground rent amortization, tenant lease inducement amortization, and other fees.
