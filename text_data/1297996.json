Industry Background The digital economy continues to grow and change how enterprises across all industries create and deliver value. Companies increasingly need to operate ubiquitously, on-demand and with real-time intelligence serving customers, partners and employees across multiple channels, business functions and points of business presence. Computational processing power requirements continue to advance, data traffic is growing, and the volume of data that enterprises generate, transmit, process, analyze, monitor and manage is expanding dramatically. The Internet of Things, 5G, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, among other technological advancements, are driving this digital transformation. We believe that enterprise data growth is accelerating due to the growing digital economy and emerging technological advances. As enterprises analyze and process this accelerating data mass, they create more data. As this mass of data continues to grow, it needs to be analyzed and processed: a task which we believe is becoming increasingly challenging to replicate and relocate. This phenomenon is called Data Gravity. We believe that enterprise decisionmakers will need to increasingly consider the impact of how Data Gravity impacts their enterprise IT architectures and, accordingly, we have developed the Data Gravity Index: a global forecast that measures the intensity and gravitational force of enterprise data growth. 1 1  Table of Contents\u200bIndex to Financial Statements\u200bAs the largest global provider of cloud- and carrier-neutral data center, colocation and interconnection solutions, we believe the data center industry is poised for sustainable growth. The demand for data center infrastructure is being driven by this digital transformation which is contributing to the explosive growth of data, rapid growth of cloud adoption and greater demand for IT outsourcing. The power requirements and financial costs to support this growth in data, traffic and storage are substantial and growing accordingly. We believe data centers will continue to play a critical role in the digital economy and enabling business transformation strategies.We believe cloud solutions and hybrid cloud solutions will remain significant drivers of demand for data center infrastructure. The hybrid cloud, which combines public and private cloud solutions, has gained traction because it enables corporate enterprises to achieve efficiencies and contain costs, as well as scale and secure their most sensitive information. In addition, the leading cloud service providers are generally mature, well-capitalized technology companies, and cloud platforms are among the fastest-growing business segments. Data center providers that can solve global coverage, capacity and connectivity needs, and coordinate and aggregate diverse customer and application demand, are poised to benefit from these cloud-specific industry drivers.These diverse and secular industry dynamics are driving greater demand for data center capacity not only from global cloud service providers, but also from businesses across other industries, including IT service firms, social media, content providers and the financial services sector. As companies focus on their core competencies and rely on outsourcing to meet their IT infrastructure needs, they are prioritizing colocation for their data center solutions for various reasons, including to reduce latency in data transfer and increase global presence and connectivity. New technologies need a fast, reliable and flexible foundation to operate, and the importance of offering a full spectrum of power, space and connectivity solutions on a global platform continues to grow.Our BusinessWe provide a global data center platform that supports our customers\u2019 digital infrastructure and enables our customers to interconnect with their customers and partners. We solve global coverage, capacity and connectivity needs for companies of all sizes, including the world\u2019s leading enterprises and services providers, through PlatformDIGITAL\u00ae, a global data center platform for scaling digital business which enables customers to deploy their critical infrastructure with a global data center provider.PlatformDIGITAL\u00ae combines our global presence with our Pervasive Data Center Architecture (PDx\u00ae) solution methodology for scaling digital business and efficiently managing data gravity challenges. Our global data center footprint gives customers access to the connected data communities that matter to them with over 300 facilities in 54 metropolitan areas across 28 countries on six continents. Fundamentally, we bring together foundational real estate and innovative technology expertise around the world to deliver a comprehensive, dedicated product suite to meet customers\u2019 data and connectivity needs. We represent an important part of the digital economy that we believe will benefit from powerful, long-term growth drivers.We believe that the growth trends in the data center market, technology, the cloud, internet traffic and internet-based services, combined with cost advantages in outsourcing data center requirements, provide attractive growth opportunities for us as a data center solutions provider. Leveraging deep expertise in technology and real estate, we have an expansive global footprint, impressive scale and a full-spectrum fit-for-purpose product offering in key metropolitan areas around the world. These advantages simplify the contracting process for multinational enterprises, eliminating their need to negotiate with multiple local data center solutions providers.

These procedures, together with our in-depth knowledge of the technology, data center and real estate industries, allow us to identify strategically located properties and evaluate investment opportunities efficiently and, as appropriate, commit and close quickly. Our investment-grade ratings, along with our broad network of contacts within the data center industry, enable us to effectively capitalize on acquisition and investment opportunities.Our Management Team and OrganizationOur senior management team has many\u00a0years of experience in the technology and/or real estate industries, including experience as investors in and advisors to technology companies. We believe that our senior management team\u2019s extensive knowledge of both the technology and the real estate industries provides us with a key competitive advantage. Further, a significant portion of compensation for our senior management team and directors is in the form of common equity interests in our Company. We also maintain minimum stock ownership requirements for our senior management team and directors, further aligning their interests with those of external stockholders, as well as an employee stock purchase plan, which encourages our employees to increase their ownership in the Company.Our Business and Growth StrategiesOur primary business objectives are to maximize: (i)\u00a0sustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit, (ii)\u00a0cash flow and returns to our stockholders and our Operating Partnership\u2019s unitholders through the payment of dividends and distributions and (iii)\u00a0return on invested capital. We expect to accomplish these objectives by achieving superior risk-adjusted returns, prudently allocating capital, diversifying our product offerings, accelerating our global reach and scale, and driving revenue growth and operating efficiencies.Superior Risk-Adjusted Returns. We believe that achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns on our business, including on our development pipeline and leasing transactions, will deliver superior stockholder returns. We may continue to build out our development pipeline when justified by anticipated returns. We have established robust internal guidelines for reviewing and approving leasing transactions, which we believe will drive risk-adjusted returns. We also believe that providing an even stronger value proposition to our customers, including new and more comprehensive product offerings, as well as continuing to improve operational efficiencies, will further drive improved returns for our business.Prudently Allocate Capital. We believe that the strategic deployment of capital at sufficiently positive spreads above our cost of capital enables us to increase cash flow and create long-term stockholder value.Strategic and Complementary Investments. We have developed significant expertise at underwriting, financing and executing data center investment opportunities. We employ a collaborative approach to deal analysis, risk management and asset allocation, focusing on key elements, such as market fundamentals, accessibility to fiber and power, and the local regulatory environment. In addition, the specialized nature of data centers makes these investment opportunities more difficult for traditional real estate investors to underwrite, resulting in reduced competition for investments relative to other property types. We believe this dynamic creates an opportunity for us to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on our capital.8 Table of Contents\u200bIndex to Financial Statements\u200b Table of Contents \u200b Index to Financial Statements \u200b Our Investment ApproachWe have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating acquisitions and investments, including income-producing properties as well as vacant buildings and land suitable for development, to ensure that they meet our strategic, financial, technical and other criteria.

We are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our goal is to average through business cycles the following financial ratios: 1) a debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.5x, 2) a fixed charge coverage of greater than three times, and 3) floating rate debt at less than 20% of total outstanding debt. In addition, we strive to maintain a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, and we seek to maximize the menu of our available sources of capital, while minimizing the cost. Since Digital Realty Trust,\u00a0Inc.\u2019s initial public offering in 2004, we have raised approximately $59 billion of capital through common (excluding forward contracts), preferred and convertible preferred equity offerings, exchangeable debt offerings, non-exchangeable bond offerings, our global revolving credit facilities, our term loan facilities, a senior notes shelf facility, secured mortgage financings and re-financings, joint venture partnerships and the sale of non-core assets. We endeavor to maintain financial flexibility while using our liquidity and access to capital to support operations, our acquisition, investment, leasing and development programs and global campus expansion, which are important sources of our growth.Leverage Technology to Develop Comprehensive and Diverse Products. We believe we have one of the most comprehensive suites of global data center solutions available to customers from a single provider.Global Service Infrastructure Platform. With our recent acquisitions, which extended our footprint further across Latin America, Europe and Africa, enhanced our portfolio of scale and hyper-scale data centers in the U.S. and furthered our position as a leading provider of colocation, interconnection and cloud-enablement services globally, we are able to offer one of the industry\u2019s broadest range of data center solutions to meet our customers\u2019 needs, from a single rack or cabinet to multi-megawatt deployments. We believe our products like ServiceFabric\u2122 and our partnerships with managed services and cloud service providers further enhance the attractiveness of our data centers.Provide Foundational Services to Enable Customers and Partners. We believe that the platform, through which we offer the foundational services of space, power and connectivity, will enable our customers and partners to serve their customers and grow their businesses. We believe our Internet gateway data centers, individual data centers and data center campuses are attractive to a wide variety of customers and partners of all sizes. Furthermore, we believe our colocation and interconnection offerings, as well as the densely connected data communities that have developed within our facilities, and the availability and scalability of our comprehensive suite of products are valuable and critical to our customers and partners.Accelerate Global Reach and Scale. We have strategically pursued international expansion since our IPO in 2004 and now operate across six continents.\u00a0We believe that our global multi-product data center portfolio is a foundational element of our strategy and our scale and global platform represent key competitive advantages difficult to replicate. Customers and competitors are recognizing the value of interconnected scale, which aligns with our connected campus strategy that enables customers to \u201cland and expand\u201d with us. We expect to continue to source and execute strategic and complementary transactions to strengthen our data center portfolio, expand our global footprint and product mix, and enhance our scale. Drive Revenue Growth and Operating Efficiencies. We aggressively manage our properties to maximize cash flow and control costs by leveraging our scale to drive operating efficiencies.Leverage Strong Industry Relationships. Our global market leadership position and strong industry relationships provide us with a unique vantage point to detect and capitalize on secular trends as they emerge globally. We focus our industry relationship efforts towards market sensing, market shaping and helping to set open standards that benefit companies of all types to derive value from digital infrastructure and multi-tenant datacenters. Industry collaboration includes engagements with industry associations, IT industry analysts, venture capitalists, technology incubators, technology service providers, telecommunications providers, systems integrators and large multi-national companies across segments including manufacturing, transportation & logistics, financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical and digital media. These relationships help us forge new product capabilities, inform investment decisions, develop new routes to market and create differentiated value for customers and drive long-term growth and yield for shareholders.9 Table of Contents\u200bIndex to Financial Statements\u200b Table of Contents \u200b Index to Financial Statements \u200b Preserve the Flexibility of Our Balance Sheet.

Under the Obama administration, the EPA finalized rules imposing permitting and control technology requirements upon certain newly-constructed or modified facilities which emit GHGs under the Clean Air Act New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or NSR PSD, and Title V permitting programs. As a result, newly-issued NSR PSD and Title V permits for new or modified electricity generating units (EGUs) and other facilities may need to address GHG emissions, including by requiring the installation of \u201cBest Available Control Technology.\u201d The EPA also implemented in December 2015 the \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from coal-fired and natural gas EGUs. However, in 2019 the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the \u201cAffordable Clean Energy Rule\u201d to replace the Clean Power Plan. The Affordable Clean Energy Rule requires heat rate efficiency improvements at certain EGUs, but does not place numeric limits on EGU emissions. In 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated both the Affordable Clean Energy Rule and the Clean Power Plan repeal rule, and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the ruling in 2022. The EPA announced in January 2023 that it expects to propose carbon standards for new and existing power plants in April 2023 and finalize them by June 2024. Separately, the EPA\u2019s GHG \u201creporting rule\u201d requires that certain emitters, including electricity generators, monitor and report GHG emissions.States have been driving regulation to reduce GHG emissions in the United States. At the state level, California implemented a GHG cap-and-trade program that began imposing compliance obligations on industrial sectors, including electricity generators and importers, in January 2013. In September 2016, California adopted legislation calling for a further reduction in GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and in July 2017, California extended its cap-and-trade program through 2030. In September 2018, California adopted legislation that will require all of the state\u2019s electricity to come from carbon-free sources by 2045. California also in December 2022 passed a regulation to achieve a zero-carbon economy by 2045. The plan sets out various goals, including cutting GHG emissions by 48 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, exceeding the state\u2019s mandate of a 40 percent reduction. As other examples of state action, in May 2021, Washington passed a law capping GHG emissions from electricity generators and other entities, and in December 2021 Oregon adopted a GHG cap-and-trade program. In addition, in January 2023, New York implemented a \u201ccap-and-invest\u201d program which sets an annual cap on the amount of GHG emissions permitted statewide to meet the New York Climate Act requirement of a 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 and at least an 85 percent reduction by 2050, in each case using 1990 as a baseline. Additionally, a number of states have adopted Renewable Portfolio Standards to increase the use of renewable energy, and a number of eastern states participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a market-based program aimed at reducing GHG emissions from power plants.Outside the United States, the European Union, or EU (as well as the United Kingdom), have been operating since 2005 under a cap-and-trade program, which directly affects the largest emitters of GHGs, including electricity producers from whom we purchase power, and the EU has taken a number of other climate change-related initiatives, including a directive targeted at improving energy efficiency (which introduces energy efficiency auditing requirements). In December 2019, EU leaders endorsed the objective of achieving by 2050 a climate-neutral EU, with net-zero GHG emissions, and in July 2021 the European Commission adopted the European Climate Law to write this goal into the law. The European Climate Law includes a 2030 GHG reduction target of at least 55% below 1990 levels. In July 2021 the European Commission also adopted a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to institute a carbon import tax, which covers electricity imports. In November 2022, the European Commission reached a provisional agreement with the European Parliament to establish binding GHG emission targets for the transport, buildings, waste, and agriculture sectors. National legislation may also be implemented independently by members of the EU. The United Kingdom, after Brexit, independently adopted a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and implemented an emissions trading scheme.The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the United States and 194 other countries and looks to prevent global average temperatures from increasing by more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, went into force in November 2016. President Trump announced in June 2017 that he would initiate the process to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement; however, upon his inauguration in January 2021, President Biden signed an order rejoining the Paris Agreement.15 Table of Contents\u200bIndex to Financial Statements\u200b Table of Contents \u200b Index to Financial Statements \u200b The EPA made an endangerment finding in 2009 that allows it to create regulations imposing emissions reporting, permitting, control technology installation, and monitoring requirements applicable to certain emitters of GHGs, including facilities that provide electricity to our data centers, although the materiality of the impacts will not be fully known until all regulations are finalized and legal challenges are resolved.

The United Kingdom, after Brexit, independently adopted a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and implemented an emissions trading scheme.The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the United States and 194 other countries and looks to prevent global average temperatures from increasing by more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, went into force in November 2016. President Trump announced in June 2017 that he would initiate the process to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement; however, upon his inauguration in January 2021, President Biden signed an order rejoining the Paris Agreement. The EPA made an endangerment finding in 2009 that allows it to create regulations imposing emissions reporting, permitting, control technology installation, and monitoring requirements applicable to certain emitters of GHGs, including facilities that provide electricity to our data centers, although the materiality of the impacts will not be fully known until all regulations are finalized and legal challenges are resolved. Under the Obama administration, the EPA finalized rules imposing permitting and control technology requirements upon certain newly-constructed or modified facilities which emit GHGs under the Clean Air Act New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or NSR PSD, and Title V permitting programs. As a result, newly-issued NSR PSD and Title V permits for new or modified electricity generating units (EGUs) and other facilities may need to address GHG emissions, including by requiring the installation of \u201cBest Available Control Technology.\u201d The EPA also implemented in December 2015 the \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from coal-fired and natural gas EGUs. However, in 2019 the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the \u201cAffordable Clean Energy Rule\u201d to replace the Clean Power Plan. The Affordable Clean Energy Rule requires heat rate efficiency improvements at certain EGUs, but does not place numeric limits on EGU emissions. In 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated both the Affordable Clean Energy Rule and the Clean Power Plan repeal rule, and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the ruling in 2022. The EPA announced in January 2023 that it expects to propose carbon standards for new and existing power plants in April 2023 and finalize them by June 2024. Separately, the EPA\u2019s GHG \u201creporting rule\u201d requires that certain emitters, including electricity generators, monitor and report GHG emissions. States have been driving regulation to reduce GHG emissions in the United States. At the state level, California implemented a GHG cap-and-trade program that began imposing compliance obligations on industrial sectors, including electricity generators and importers, in January 2013. In September 2016, California adopted legislation calling for a further reduction in GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and in July 2017, California extended its cap-and-trade program through 2030. In September 2018, California adopted legislation that will require all of the state\u2019s electricity to come from carbon-free sources by 2045. California also in December 2022 passed a regulation to achieve a zero-carbon economy by 2045. The plan sets out various goals, including cutting GHG emissions by 48 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, exceeding the state\u2019s mandate of a 40 percent reduction. As other examples of state action, in May 2021, Washington passed a law capping GHG emissions from electricity generators and other entities, and in December 2021 Oregon adopted a GHG cap-and-trade program. In addition, in January 2023, New York implemented a \u201ccap-and-invest\u201d program which sets an annual cap on the amount of GHG emissions permitted statewide to meet the New York Climate Act requirement of a 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 and at least an 85 percent reduction by 2050, in each case using 1990 as a baseline. Additionally, a number of states have adopted Renewable Portfolio Standards to increase the use of renewable energy, and a number of eastern states participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a market-based program aimed at reducing GHG emissions from power plants. Outside the United States, the European Union, or EU (as well as the United Kingdom), have been operating since 2005 under a cap-and-trade program, which directly affects the largest emitters of GHGs, including electricity producers from whom we purchase power, and the EU has taken a number of other climate change-related initiatives, including a directive targeted at improving energy efficiency (which introduces energy efficiency auditing requirements). In December 2019, EU leaders endorsed the objective of achieving by 2050 a climate-neutral EU, with net-zero GHG emissions, and in July 2021 the European Commission adopted the European Climate Law to write this goal into the law. The European Climate Law includes a 2030 GHG reduction target of at least 55% below 1990 levels. In July 2021 the European Commission also adopted a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to institute a carbon import tax, which covers electricity imports. In November 2022, the European Commission reached a provisional agreement with the European Parliament to establish binding GHG emission targets for the transport, buildings, waste, and agriculture sectors. National legislation may also be implemented independently by members of the EU. The United Kingdom, after Brexit, independently adopted a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and implemented an emissions trading scheme.
