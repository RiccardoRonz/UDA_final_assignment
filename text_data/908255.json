Manufacturing operations for each of the Company\u2019s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil and electricity.  The Company uses a variety of tactics in an attempt to limit the impact of supply shortages and inflationary pressures. The Company\u2019s global procurement organization works to accelerate cost reductions, purchase from lower cost regions, optimize the supply base, mitigate risk and collaborate on its buying activities. In addition, the Company uses long-term contracts, cost sharing arrangements, design changes, customer buy programs and limited financial instruments to help control costs. The Company intends to use similar measures in 2023 and beyond.\u00a0Refer to Note 17, \u201cFinancial Instruments,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item\u00a08 of this report for information related to the Company\u2019s hedging activities.\u00a0  For 2023, the Company believes there will be continued inflationary pressures in certain raw materials, labor and energy. The Company also believes there will continue to be supply constraints related to semiconductor chips. Supplies of other raw materials are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements.  Regulations  The Company operates in a constantly evolving global regulatory environment and is subject to numerous and varying regulatory requirements for its product performance and material content. The Company\u2019s practice is to identify potential regulatory and quality risks early in the design and development process and proactively manage them throughout the product lifecycle through the use of routine assessments, protocols, standards, performance measures and audits. New regulations and changes to existing regulations are managed in collaboration with the Company\u2019s OEM customers and implemented through its global systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations. The Company demonstrates material content compliance through the International Material Data System (\u201cIMDS\u201d), which is the automotive industry material data system. In the IMDS, all materials used for automobile manufacturing are archived and maintained to meet the obligations placed on the automobile manufacturers, and thus on their suppliers, by national and international standards, laws and regulations.  The Company works collaboratively with a number of stakeholder groups including government agencies, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, its customers and its suppliers to proactively engage in federal, state and international public policy processes.  14  14  14    Table of Contents Table of Contents Refer to Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulations on the Company\u2019s business.
