{"cik": 37785, "item_1A": "ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS  General FMC Corporation is a global agricultural sciences company dedicated to helping growers produce food, feed, fiber and fuel for an expanding world population while adapting to a changing environment. FMC\u2019s innovative crop protection solutions enable growers, crop advisers and turf and pest management professionals to address their toughest challenges economically without compromising safety or the environment. FMC is committed to discovering new insecticide, herbicide and fungicide active ingredients, product formulations and pioneering technologies that are consistently better for the planet. FMC Strategy We have streamlined our portfolio over the past ten years to become a tier-one leader and the fifth largest global innovator in the agricultural chemicals market. Our strong competitive position is driven by our technology and innovation, as well as our geographic balance and crop diversity, which helped FMC to take share in 2020, 2021 and 2022 in our key markets.  Our leading insecticides, herbicides and fungicides, including our biological technologies, that farmers rely on to protect their crops from disease and pests were produced at five active ingredient plants, 16 formulation and packaging sites and sold in approximately 120 countries. Helping farmers grow more food sustainably on less arable land requires a continual stream of new products and technologies. We are investing in one of the agricultural industry\u2019s most productive crop protection pipeline, featuring 23 new active ingredients in discovery and 11 new active ingredients in development. More than 18 of these molecules feature new modes of action.  We own and operate a total of 21 manufacturing plants, and we have the scale to operate with strong resources and global reach to address changing market conditions. Our supply chain organization effectively managed to continue supplying customers and growing our business, despite multiple shutdowns and other disruptions in the chemical sector in the last several years.  FMC revenues grew approximately 15 percent, or 18 percent organically(1) excluding the impacts of foreign currency, year over year in 2022, driven by strong volume growth and pricing gains in North America and Latin America. Approximately $600 million in 2022 sales came from products launched in the last five years, representing 10 percent of the total revenue. In 2022, we had new product launches in Canada of Coragen\u00ae Max insecticide based on Rynaxypyr\u00ae active and in Brazil of Boral\u00ae Full, our new herbicide mixture product. We had new product launches in Argentina and Paraguay of Onsuva\u00ae fungicide based on our new Fluindapyr active ingredient. Products launched in 2022 accounted for approximately $100 million in sales. Our diamides, Rynaxypyr\u00ae and Cyazypyr\u00ae active ingredients, continued to be a significant part of our portfolio, representing approximately $2.1\u00a0billion in combined sales and approximately 36 percent of the total revenue in 2022. We also grew our Plant Health program, which includes FMC\u2019s biologicals platform, by 8 percent. Plant Health is now over $230 million in sales and outpacing market growth. FMC performed better than the overall crop protection market in 2022, which we estimate grew in the low-double digit percentage range versus 2021. Foreign currency was a headwind to full-year revenue. As mentioned above, our revenue growth rate was 15 percent, and excluding the impact of foreign currency, our organic(1) growth rate was 18 percent. FMC\u2019s innovation, from our current portfolio of advanced products to our R&D discovery, development and new formulations, contributed to our performance. Our technology portfolio includes specific innovations in plant health, application technology and delivery systems, as well as advanced agronomic insights through Arc\u2122 farm intelligence, our precision agriculture platform that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning. __________________\u00a0 (1)Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP term which excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. Refer to the \"Results of Operations\" section of our Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 for our organic revenue non-GAAP reconciliation.  4 4 4 Table of Contents Table of Contents Acquisitions and Divestitures On June 29, 2022, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire BioPhero ApS (\"BioPhero\"), a Denmark-based pheromone research and production company. The acquisition adds state-of-the-art biologically produced pheromone insect control technology to our product portfolio and R&D pipeline, underscoring our role as a leader in delivering innovative and sustainable crop protection solutions. The purchase price of approximately $193\u00a0million was primarily paid at closing on July 19, 2022. The acquisition included all of BioPhero\u2019s technology, IP, supply agreements, employees and net assets of the business. We continued to make investments through FMC Ventures, our venture capital arm which we formed in 2020 to target strategic investments in start-ups and early-stage companies that are developing and applying emerging technologies in the agricultural industry. In May 2020, FMC entered into a binding offer with Isagro S.p.A (\"Isagro\") to acquire the remaining rights for Fluindapyr active ingredient assets from Isagro. In July 2020, we entered into an asset sale and purchase agreement with Isagro. On October 2, 2020, we closed on the transaction with a purchase price of approximately $65 million. Fluindapyr has been jointly developed by FMC and Isagro under a 2012 research and development collaboration agreement. The transaction provided FMC with full global rights to the Fluindapyr active ingredient, including key U.S., European, Asian, and Latin American fungicide markets. The transaction transferred to FMC all intellectual property, know-how, registrations, product formulations and other global assets of the proprietary broad-spectrum fungicide molecule. The acquired assets have been classified as in-process research and development. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K for accounting considerations. The transaction has expanded our fungicide portfolio by giving us full global rights to the Fluindapyr active ingredient and is an important strategic addition to our product line. In 2022, we launched Onsuva\u2122 fungicide which is based on the Fluindapyr active in Argentina and Paraguay. Onsuva\u2122 fungicide targets diseases in soy and peanut crops.

The majority of our product lines consist of insecticides and herbicides, and we have a growing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments. Our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests, while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficult-to-control weeds. In addition, we are also investing substantially in our Plant Health program which includes biologicals, crop nutrition, and seed treatment products. Biological technologies developed by FMC\u2019s R&D team in Denmark offer excellent sustainability profiles and serve as strong complements to our synthetic products. Our biologicals feature attributes that exceed the competition, such as high stability, long shelf life, low use rates and compatibility with other chemistries. We have our own sales and marketing organizations and access the market through a combination of distributors, retailers and co-ops in all four regions. In addition, we sell directly to large growers in select countries such as Brazil. Through these and other alliances, along with our own targeted marketing efforts, access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives, we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and non-crop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively. Industry Overview  The three principal categories of agricultural and non-crop chemicals are: insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, representing approximately 40 percent, 29 percent and 28 percent of global industry revenue, respectively. The agrochemicals industry is more consolidated following several mergers of the leading crop protection companies, which now include FMC, ChemChina (owner of Syngenta Group, which includes the former Syngenta and Adama), Bayer AG (acquired Monsanto in 2018), BASF AG and Corteva Agriscience. These five innovation companies currently represent approximately 71 percent of the crop protection industry\u2019s global sales. The next group of agrochemical producers include UPL Ltd., Sumitomo Chemical Company Ltd., and Nufarm Ltd. FMC employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops, markets and geographies, while also being supported by a low-cost manufacturing model. Growth We are among the leading agrochemical producers in the world.\u00a0Several products from our portfolio are based on patent-protected active ingredients and continue to grow well above market patterns. Our complementary technologies combine  7 7 7 Table of Contents Table of Contents improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline, resulting in new and differentiated products. We continue to take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver near-term growth. We continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring, accessing, developing, marketing, distributing and/or selling complementary chemistries, biologicals, and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers. Our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable solutions that can effectively increase farmers\u2019 yields and provide alternatives to products which may be prone to resistance. We are committed to providing unique, differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles. Our external growth efforts include product acquisitions, in-licensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access, complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces. We have entered into a range of development and distribution agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize. In FMC Precision Agriculture, we are broadening our award-winning Arc\u2122 farm intelligence platform, a proprietary mobile solution that helps farmers better understand and manage pest pressure through predictive modeling based on real-time and historical data, entomological models, hyper-local weather information and in-field sensors. Arc\u2122 farm intelligence, which is now available in over 20 countries across 20 million acres, allows growers to address pest pressure more efficiently, manage infestations before they escalate and target applications in a more sustainable manner.   Our venture capital arm, FMC Ventures, continued to build its portfolio in 2022 with new collaborations and strategic investments in start-ups and early stage companies working on new or disruptive technologies. These engagements, which support or augment our internal capabilities, span several important technology segments, including robotics, drone technology, Ag-FinTech, pathogen detection, soil health, peptides and pheromones. In 2022, FMC Ventures increased its investment in Micropep, a startup developing short natural peptide molecules that target and regulate plant genes and proteins. The venture capital arm also agreed to an investment in Traive, an Ag-FinTech startup addressing working capital needs of growers in Brazil. FMC Ventures continues to scout for and invest in game changing innovations that shape the future of crop protection. Diamide Growth Strategy Our product portfolio features two key diamide-class molecules \u2013 Rynaxypyr\u00ae (chlorantraniliprole) and Cyazypyr\u00ae (cyantraniliprole) actives \u2013 with combined annual revenues of approximately $2.1\u00a0billion in 2022. These two molecules are industry-leading in terms of performance, combining highly effective low dose rates with fast-acting, systemic, long residual control. These attributes quickly established Rynaxypyr\u00ae active as the world\u2019s leading insect control technology and we expect it to continue a strong growth trajectory notwithstanding the expiration of composition of matter patents covering Rynaxypyr\u00ae active in certain countries which started in late 2022. Our Cyazypyr\u00ae active, a second-generation diamide, is growing quickly as we obtain more product registrations. We expect Cyazypyr\u00ae active to continue to grow strongly notwithstanding the expiration of its active ingredient composition of matter patents starting in the mid-2020s. This expectation is based not only on our broad patent estate and the timing of key patent milestones, but also on other critical elements that will allow FMC to continue to profitably grow the diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents. Some of the critical elements supporting diamide growth include registration and data protection, commercial strategies, brand recognition, as well as manufacturing and supply chain complexity and FMC efficiencies.   Patents and Trade Secrets.  The FMC diamide insect control patent estate is made up of many different patent families which cover: Composition of matter \u2013 both active ingredients and certain intermediates; Manufacturing processes \u2013 both active ingredients and certain intermediates; Formulations; Uses; and Applications. For Rynaxypyr\u00ae and Cyazypyr\u00ae actives related patents, as of December 31, 2022, we had 33 families with granted patents filed in up to 76 countries, with a total of 727 active granted patents as well as numerous pending patent applications. See \"Patents, Trademarks and Licenses\" within this Item 1 for more details. FMC\u2019s process patents cover the manufacturing processes for both active ingredients \u2013 chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole \u2013 as well as key intermediates that are used to make the final products. Chlorantraniliprole is a complex molecule to produce, requiring 16 separate steps; FMC owns granted patents covering many of these 16 process steps and several of the intermediate chemicals, and we protect other aspects of the manufacturing processes by trade secret. Cyantraniliprole is similarly complex and covered by a comparable range of intellectual property. Many of these intermediate process patents run well past the expiration of the composition of matter patents, and in some cases stretch until the end of this decade. Third parties that intend to manufacture and sell generic chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole and rely on FMC\u2019s extensive product safety data will be required to demonstrate that their product has an equivalent regulatory safety profile as FMC's Rynaxypyr\u00ae and Cyazypyr\u00ae actives. To meet regulatory requirements for such difficult-to-manufacture molecules, we believe that third parties will have to produce these active ingredients using the same processes that are patented by FMC and if so, would be infringing before patent expiration and subject to our challenge for infringement. FMC also owns formulation patents which cover the use of chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole in specific formulations found in commercially important end-use products.       8 8 8 Table of Contents Table of Contents Regulatory Data Protection.  In addition to the patent estate, various pesticide laws and regulations around the world offer added protection to the initial active ingredient registrant in the form of data protection that can extend after the composition or process patents have expired. These rules can effectively provide a product innovator and initial active ingredient registrant such as FMC with a further period of exclusive use of the key reference data even after the applicable active ingredient composition of matter patents have expired. Further, in certain countries, even after the period of exclusive use has expired, a generic entrant seeking to rely on the initial registrant\u2019s reference data may have to pay significant compensation to the initial registrant. For FMC\u2019s diamide products, such rights apply in key markets including United States and the European Union. Growing the FMC Diamide Franchise. FMC is executing a strategy to supply end-use products containing Rynaxypyr\u00ae and Cyazypyr\u00ae actives to a broad range of companies prior to patent expiration, and in return establishing long-term purchase commitments from these companies. These arrangements may also include limited patent, data and/or trademark licenses. Such partner relationships allow us to grow our business by having others develop and sell diamide-based products to meet farmers' needs not within our current portfolio, offering those farmers a better alternative to competing insecticides with product safety or efficacy profiles which are less attractive than Rynaxypyr\u00ae or Cyazypyr\u00ae actives. These agreements can require the third-party to use the well-known and trusted Rynaxypyr\u00ae or Cyazypyr\u00ae brand names on the end-use products formulated with active ingredient supplied by FMC. As of December 31, 2022, we had global agreements with five major multinational companies and approximately 50 separate local-country agreements covering over 15 countries. We are continuing to explore opportunities with additional companies beyond those with whom we are already engaged. Furthermore, FMC is developing an extensive portfolio of new diamide-containing products to address grower needs around the world.  The first of these products, under the trademarks Elevest\u00ae, Vantacor\u00ae, and Altacor\u00ae eVo, were launched in the US and other countries, including Canada and Australia, starting in late 2020 through 2022 and will be launched in additional countries in 2023 onward. Our current diamide pipeline contains approximately 20 new products to be launched this decade and we continue to explore further innovations based on the diamide chemistry. Complexity of manufacturing.  Today FMC manufactures all the required intermediates in the multi-step processes, as well as the final Rynaxypyr\u00ae and Cyazypyr\u00ae actives, at our own active ingredient manufacturing plants or through key contract manufacturers who produce under long-term exclusive technology-license agreements. A third-party replicating this complex supply chain and manufacturing network would be a major undertaking with very large capital requirements. In addition, given our manufacturing know-how, scale of our operations, and continual investment in manufacturing process improvement, we believe FMC\u2019s manufacturing costs will be substantially lower than any other party seeking to produce these diamide products in compliance with all applicable laws.  Collectively, these four factors \u2013 deep patent estate, proprietary regulatory data, strong commercial approach leveraging our brand recognition, and capabilities of managing large scale manufacturing complexity \u2013 provide us the basis for our expectation that FMC will be the company of choice to supply chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole products to third-party partners, and ultimately to farmers, well into the future.  Source and Availability of Raw Materials We utilize numerous vendors to supply raw materials and intermediate chemicals to support operations. These materials are sourced on a global basis to strategically balance FMC\u2019s vendor portfolio.  Patents, Trademarks and Licenses As an agricultural sciences company, FMC believes in innovation and in protecting that innovation through intellectual property rights. We own and license a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property that are cumulatively important to our business. In addition, we seek to license our proprietary technologies through partnering arrangements that effectively allow us to capitalize from our intellectual property. The FMC intellectual property estate provides us with a significant competitive advantage which we seek to expand and renew on a continual basis. We manage our technology investment to discover and develop new active ingredients and biological products, as well as to continue to improve manufacturing processes and existing active ingredients through new formulations, mixtures or other concepts. FMC\u2019s technology innovation processes capture those innovations and protect them through the most appropriate form of intellectual property rights. We also in-license certain active ingredients and other technologies under patents held by third parties, and have granted licenses to certain of our patents to third parties.    Our patents cover many aspects of our business, including our chemical and biological active ingredients, intermediate chemicals, manufacturing processes to produce such active ingredients or intermediates, formulations, and product uses, as well as many aspects of our research and development activities that support the FMC new product pipeline. Patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned a total of approximately 200 active granted U.S. patents and 2,600 active granted foreign patents (includes Supplemental Patent Certificates); we also have approximately 2,100 patent applications pending globally. 9 9 9 Table of Contents Table of Contents In our current product portfolio, our diamide insect control products based on Rynaxypyr\u00ae (Chlorantraniliprole) and Cyazypyr\u00ae (Cyantraniliprole) active ingredients have a substantial patent estate which will remain in force well into the future. More details regarding our diamide granted patent estate are set forth in the tables below: Numbers of active Granted Patents by type*:  Chlorantraniliprole and Cyantraniliprole, as of December 31, 2022United StatesForeignActive Ingredients2162Intermediates and Methods of Manufacturing19230Formulations/Mixtures/Applications6308Total27700 *Patent families were only placed under one type but may cover several types.

Unlike patents, ownership rights in trademarks can be continued indefinitely so long as the trademarks are properly used and renewal fees are paid.  We actively monitor and manage our patents and trademarks to maintain our rights in these assets and we strategically take aggressive action when we believe our intellectual property rights are being infringed. During 2022, we initiated proceedings to enforce several of our patents and trademarks against generic producers and infringers, resulting in multiple favorable judgments and settlements, including in India and China. In early 2022, we received notice that certain third parties are seeking to invalidate our Chinese patents on a certain intermediate involved in producing chlorantraniliprole and a process to produce chlorantraniliprole; we intend to defend vigorously the validity of both patents. During the third quarter of 2022, the China Patent Review Board issued rulings which held that the two challenged patents were not valid in China. We believe the Review Board\u2019s decisions are seriously flawed both on procedural and substantive ground and we have filed appeals. Under Chinese law, the patents remain valid but are not enforceable pending appeal. Given the unique and specific Chinese patent laws and legal procedures at issue in that situation, we do not believe that the China Patent Review Board\u2019s decisions would materially impact our enforcement of similar patents in other countries. Patent challenges in response to enforcement efforts is expected as an ordinary defense tactic in patent enforcement cases, and have been raised in several of our enforcement cases to date; we intend to defend vigorously any diamide patents that are challenged. While we believe that the invalidity or loss of any particular patent, trademark or license after appeal would be an unlikely possibility, our patent and trademark estate related to our diamide insect control products based on Rynaxypyr\u00ae and Cyazypyr\u00ae active ingredients in the aggregate are of material importance to our operations. The composition of matter patent that covers chlorantraniliprole (also known as Rynaxypyr\u00ae active) expired in a number of countries in August 2022; this patent will continue to remain in force in other countries throughout the world, expiring on a country-by-country basis at various dates through 2027. We are deploying a multi-pronged strategy to defend that business after active ingredient patent expiration, including enforcement of our patents in many countries which continue to cover chemical intermediates and manufacturing processes that are essential in the production of chlorantraniliprole. Patents involve complex factual and legal issues and thus each case is being litigated on the merits; we often seek preliminary injunctive relief to stop sales of products which we believe to be infringing \u2013 since equitable relief at the early stage of a litigation is subject to a higher standard of proof than decisions made after a trial on the merits, we may have difficulty prevailing in all cases at that preliminary stage. However, even in situations in which we are not able to prevail on interim relief, we intend to continue litigating in such cases and seek permanent injunctive relief and recovery of damages after a full trial. Seasonality The seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of our business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations. Our products sold in the northern hemisphere (North America, Europe and parts of Asia) serve seasonal agricultural markets from March through September, generally resulting in significant earnings in the first and second quarters, and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter. Markets in the southern hemisphere (Latin America  10 10 10 Table of Contents Table of Contents and parts of the Asia Pacific region, including Australia) are served from July through February, generally resulting in earnings in the third, fourth and first quarters.  Competition We encounter substantial competition in our business. We market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners, independent distributors and sales representatives. The number of our principal competitors varies from market to market. In general, we compete by providing advanced technology, high product quality, reliability, quality customer and technical service, and by operating in a cost-efficient manner. Our business competes primarily in the global crop protection market for insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Industry products include crop protection chemicals and biologicals, for certain major competitors, genetically engineered (crop biotechnology) products. Competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents have expired in the last two decades. In general, we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development, including novel formulations, proprietary mixes, and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing (mostly) proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus. We also differentiate ourselves by our global cost-competitiveness through our manufacturing strategies, establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions. Research and Development Expense The R&D efforts in our business focus on discovering and developing environmentally sound solutions \u2014 both new active ingredients and new product formulations \u2014 that meet the needs of farmers to maximize yields and control pests. On June 24, 2019, we announced our investment of more than $50 million at our FMC Stine Research Center in Newark, Delaware, to upgrade infrastructure. We anticipate that the investment in this project will continue in 2023 with expected completion in 2024.  Environmental Laws and Regulations A discussion of environmental related factors can be found in Item\u00a07 \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and in Note 12 \"Environmental Obligations\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Human Capital Employees We employ approximately 6,600 people with about 1,600 people in our domestic operations and 5,000 people in our foreign operations.  Approximately 3 percent of our U.S.-based and 37 percent of our foreign-based employees, respectively, are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We have successfully concluded our recent contract negotiations without any material work stoppages. We cannot predict, however, the outcome of future contract negotiations. In 2023, 5 foreign collective-bargaining agreements will be expiring. These contracts affect approximately 21 percent of our foreign-based employees. There are no U.S. collective-bargaining agreements expiring in 2023.  Talent Engagement and Retention At FMC, it is important that we focus our programs and initiatives on sustaining strong leaders who are committed to engaging and developing employees, so they can lead competitively, innovate change, improve business performance, and successfully maintain a competitive advantage. FMC provides leadership development through structured leadership programs worldwide. FMC\u2019s program components include in-class and self-paced learning, development planning and stretch assignments, project-based action learning and rotational learning, mentoring and coaching, and leadership and functional assessments. Our programs are designed to provide engaging, collaborative, and creative learning environments. Employees leverage their experiences in these programs to develop leadership abilities to their highest levels, enabling them to deliver innovative solutions, strong results and continued growth. FMC creates an environment where we promote our values, embrace diversity, and build an inclusive culture. We achieve this through a variety of programs and initiatives such as quarterly Town Hall meetings, employee engagement surveys, focus groups, learning opportunities, and philanthropic initiatives, and we continue to enable Employee Resource Groups (\"ERGs\") to help foster an inclusive workplace for employees. FMC continually strives to meet the needs of our employees, shareholders, and customers through competitive rewards, policies, and practices that support the company as an employer of choice in every market where we compete for talent.  FMC compensates employees through total reward programs that are aligned with performance and competencies.  Performance- 11 11 11 Table of Contents Table of Contents based direct pay programs include competitive base pay, annual bonus opportunities, sales incentive plans, and long-term incentives. These compensation elements along with benefits, work-life flexibility, recognition awards, talent and career development, enable FMC to offer a comprehensive total reward package designed for employees throughout their career.  Culture and Inclusion Diversity Equity & Inclusion (\"DEI\") is central to our growth strategy, and we continue to make FMC more diverse, equitable and inclusive for all employees and stakeholders. In 2022, we realigned our global DEI program to ensure we are prioritizing objectives related to workforce diversity, equitable processes, and inclusive culture. We made good progress toward our representation goals related to women globally and Black/African Americans in our U.S. workforce. We increased the overall percent representation and net additions of women and Black/African Americans, closing 2022 with positive results across all regions and at various levels of the organization.  In addition to an intentional focus on the goals throughout our hiring processes, our progress was driven by strategic investments and community partnerships. For example, in our Brazil manufacturing organization, we took steps to build a pipeline of female candidates for our Uberaba plant by developing strong partnerships with local educational institutions and peers, which included providing education and professional training as well as apprenticeship programs for women. These investments resulted in a strong pool of female candidates prepared for job opportunities in manufacturing operations. We were able to hire more women through these efforts at our Uberaba plant, increasing the percentage of female employees to 42 percent in the Brazil manufacturing organization. We also increased the percentage of women in our commercial sales organization in many countries across North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. A good portion of this growth can also be attributed to strategic investments and community partnerships. Notably, we launched our first student symposium for research and development (\"Advancing Diversity in Science\"), hosting students at our global R&D center in Newark, Delaware, from the University of Delaware and local historically black colleges and universities (\"HBCUs\") including Delaware State University and University of Maryland Eastern Shore. The special event helped students learn about FMC, engage with FMC employees in STEM careers, showcase their own research and explore the possibilities of careers in STEM at FMC.  We balanced our recruiting and hiring efforts with initiatives to increase retention. FMC implemented a formal retention program and the Retention & Belonging Office aimed at supporting current employees as they navigate their career journeys (e.g., career coaching program). Throughout the implementation and ongoing promotion of the program, we have been intentional about reaching underrepresented groups, ensuring they take full advantage of and achieve the benefits from our retention programs. In addition, we better equipped managers and employees on talent management and development methodologies with enhanced processes and tools that can help guide and navigate careers of our diverse talent across the company. Our network of Regional Inclusion Councils and ERGs remain critical to driving strong employee engagement, providing learning/awareness initiatives, and building greater allyship and advocacy for our employees across various dimensions of diversity. As we look ahead, our focus is on expanding efforts to build more diverse candidate pools, driving greater retention of diverse employees and strengthening our culture of inclusion and belonging with the understanding that diverse views, backgrounds, and experiences will always be key to our success. Safety  Safety is a core value of FMC. At FMC, people come first. We strive for an injury-free workplace, where every person returns home the same way they arrived. We encourage a culture of open reporting, to learn from our mistakes and work towards continuous improvement in behaviors and processes. As a result of our firm commitment to safety, our Total Recordable Incident Rate (\"TRIR\") of 0.0795 continues to be among the lowest in the industry globally and in the top decile of peer companies in North America, placing our company among the safest organizations in the chemical industry. This level of performance underscores our collective commitment to work safely every day. We empower our people to always put safety first. 2022 continued to challenge us with issues related to the COVID pandemic, as well as the war in Ukraine and continued growth of our business. FMC responded by collaborating across functions to ensure safe operation at all of our sites. In 2023, we continue our journey, focusing on improving management systems and tools. In addition, we continue to engage our global workforce through focused campaigns which address issues and trends identified through analysis of our environment, health and safety data. 12 12 12 Table of Contents Table of Contents Sustainability We are committed to delivering products that maintain a safe and secure food supply and to do so in a way that protects the environment for future generations. To reflect this commitment, we established sustainability goals to challenge ourselves and ensure that we are helping to create a better world. We recognize that sustainability goes beyond reducing emissions, it also encompasses how we utilize scarce resources, such as water, and the importance of nature, including biodiversity. FMC is aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (\"SDGs\") #2 (Zero Hunger), #8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), #13 (Climate Action) and #15 (Life on Land). Our goals include achieving (i) 100 percent research and development spend on developing sustainable products by 2025, (ii) <0.1 TRIR by 2025, (iii) net-zero Greenhouse Gas (\"GHG\") emissions across the value chain (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) by 2035, (iv)  100% waste to beneficial reuse by 2035, (v) 100% implementation of sustainable water practices by 2035, and (vii) a 100 on the Community Engagement Index by 2025. In 2022, FMC continued to make progress towards meeting its commitments on the updated goals and progress will be reported in our annual sustainability report. FMC is committed to the Science Based Target initiative (\"SBTi\"), Net-Zero Standard, in line with keeping the global temperature at 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial time. In 2022, FMC submitted our near-term and long-term targets to SBTi. FMC has committed to expected near-term targets of a 42% reduction in Scopes 1 and 2, and 25% reduction in Scope 3 by 2030. The long-term expected target is to achieve net-zero across the value chain by 2035.  FMC developed and utilizes its award-winning Sustainability Assessment Tool to determine the sustainability of new active ingredients and formulated products in the research and development pipeline. This assessment, along with other stewardship processes and tools, ensures the introduction and use of environmentally sustainable agricultural solutions.  At FMC we promote stewardship at each stage of the product life cycle, and stewardship priorities are built into the core of research and development, portfolio and marketing strategies for a truly proactive approach. We continue to strive for open and transparent communications about our product stewardship successes and challenges. FMC is continuing to phase out Highly Hazardous Pesticides (\"HHPs\") from our product portfolio. In 2022, HHPs accounted for approximately 0.2 percent of our total sales. This reduction of HHPs in our portfolio can be attributed to our internal processes which include continuous evaluation, close monitoring and subsequent phase out along with strong stewardship actions.
