Eastman began business in 1920 for the purpose of producing chemicals for Eastman Kodak Company's photographic business and became a public company, incorporated in Delaware, on December 31, 1993. Eastman has 35 manufacturing facilities and has equity interests in two manufacturing joint ventures in 12 countries that supply products to customers throughout the world. See \"Properties\" in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \"Annual Report\"). The Company's headquarters and largest manufacturing facility are located in Kingsport, Tennessee. With a robust portfolio of specialty businesses, Eastman works with customers to deliver innovative products and solutions with commitment to safety and sustainability. Eastman's businesses are managed and reported in four operating segments: Advanced Materials (\"AM\"), Additives & Functional Products (\"AFP\"), Chemical Intermediates (\"CI\"), and Fibers. See \"Business Segments\".   In the first years as a stand-alone company, Eastman was diversified between commodity and more specialty chemical businesses. Beginning in 2004, the Company refocused its strategy and changed its businesses and portfolio of products, first by the divestiture and discontinuance of under-performing assets and commodity businesses and initiatives (including divestiture in 2004 of resins, inks, and monomers product lines, divestiture in 2006 of the polyethylene business, and divestiture from 2007 to 2010 of the polyethylene terephthalate (\"PET\") assets and business). The Company then pursued growth through the development and acquisition of more specialty businesses and product lines by inorganic acquisition and integration (including acquisitions of Solutia, Inc., a global leader in performance materials and specialty chemicals in 2012, and Taminco Corporation, a global specialty chemical company in 2014) and organic development and commercialization of new and enhanced technologies and products.  Eastman uses an innovation-driven growth model which consists of leveraging world class scalable technology platforms, delivering differentiated application development capabilities, and relentlessly engaging the market. The Company's world class technology platforms form the foundation of sustainable growth by differentiated products through significant scale advantages in research and development (\"R&D\") and advantaged global market access. Molecular recycling technologies continue to be an area of investment focus for the Company and extend the level of differentiation afforded by its world class technology platforms. Differentiated application development converts market complexity into opportunities for growth and accelerates innovation by enabling a deeper understanding of the value of Eastman's products and how they perform within customers' and end-users' products. Key areas of application development include thermoplastic conversion, functional films, coatings formulations, textiles and nonwovens, animal nutrition, and personal and home care formulations. The Company engages the market by working directly with customers and downstream users, targeting attractive niche markets, and leveraging disruptive macro trends. Management believes that these elements of the Company's innovation-driven growth model, combined with disciplined portfolio management and balanced capital deployment, are transforming Eastman into a global specialty materials company that enhances the quality of life in a material way. As a global specialty materials company, management continuously evaluates the Company's business and operations to improve cost structure, increase investment in growth, and strengthen execution capabilities, including specific initiatives to transform operations, work processes and systems, and business structure alignment, scale, and integration. As part of the continuous evaluation, the Company divested its rubber additives product line in 2021 and its adhesives resins assets and business in 2022, due to earnings volatility that was not in line with Eastman's expectations for the performance of a specialty business.  In 2022, the Company reported sales revenue of $10.6 billion, earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") of $1.2 billion, and net earnings attributable to Eastman of $793 million. Diluted earnings per share were $6.35. Net cash provided by operating activities was $975 million. Excluding non-core and unusual items, adjusted EBIT was $1.3 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.88. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for reconciliation of financial measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") to non-GAAP financial measures, description of excluded items, and related information. For Company sales revenue by end-use market, see Exhibit 99.01 \"2022 Company and Segment Sales Revenue by End-Use Market\" of this Annual Report. Approximately 60 percent of 2022 sales revenue was generated from outside the United States and Canada region.

Eastman is contributing to development of a more \"circular economy\". A circular economy focuses on making the most of the world's resources - minimizing waste and maximizing value - by providing end-of-life solutions to reduce, reuse, and recycle products and materials. This keeps materials in use and decouples growth from scarce resource consumption, allowing economic development and improvement in quality of life within natural resource limits. The Company's sustainable innovation initiatives include biodegradation, molecular recycling, and strategic collaborations with end-user markets. In 2019, the Company announced the use of its unique platform of solutions to address the challenges of plastic waste in the environment with advanced circular recycling, or molecular recycling, including carbon renewal and polyester renewal technologies. Together, these technologies allow the Company to use plastic waste, such as polyester carpet and textiles, as feedstock and lower greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions compared to traditional processes. Eastman's scale and integration provide a unique opportunity to accelerate the use of these molecular recycling technologies and make a meaningful positive impact on the environment.  Management approaches sustainability as a source of competitive strength by focusing its innovation strategy on opportunities where disruptive macro trends align with the Company's differentiated technology platforms and applications development capabilities to develop innovative products, applications, and technologies that enable customers' development and sale of sustainable products. Eastman's sustainability-related growth initiatives include targeted product and process innovation that focuses on enhancing product health and safety, end-use product durability, recyclability, and reducing material usage, while lowering GHG emissions associated with climate change. Eastman has focused on communication and collaboration with stakeholders, including policymakers and other interested parties, to build support for the concepts of molecular recycling and mass balance accounting (an accepted and certified protocol that documents and tracks recycled content through complex manufacturing systems). Eastman has committed to reduce its absolute scope 1 (direct GHG emissions occurring from sources that are owned by Eastman) and scope 2 (indirect GHG associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling and are a result of Eastman's energy use) emissions by approximately one-third by 2030 in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and to innovate to provide products that enable energy savings and GHG emissions reductions to customers and end-users.  Eastman focuses on the triple challenge of Climate, Circularity, and Caring for Society. Examples of Eastman sustainable solutions within identified disruptive macro trends include:  \u2022Climate:  \u2022Eastman's molecular recycling processes are expected to reduce GHG emissions by 20 percent to 50 percent when compared to processes using fossil fuels for intermediates used in various Renew products;  \u2022Saflex\u2122 Q series advanced acoustic interlayers enables weight reduction of vehicles; \u2022Solar-absorbing Saflex\u2122 PVB interlayer solutions, such as the Saflex\u2122 S series, Saflex\u2122 Solar Connect, and XIR\u2122 Solar Control Technology, are ideal for electric vehicle (\"EV\") glass in cabin-forward designs and for larger sunroofs, as they reduce loads on air-conditioning systems and help maximize EV driving range; \u2022LLumar\u2122 and SunTek\u2122 performance films, in the building and construction market, provide energy savings of 5 percent to 15 percent, depending on glass and film type; and \u2022Eastman specialty solvents reduce volatile organic compounds (\"VOC\").  \u2022Circularity: \u2022Eastman's molecular recycling technology, including carbon renewal and polyester renewal technologies, utilizes plastic waste as a feedstock. Products made with certified recycled content (allocated by International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (\"ISCC\") mass balance) include: \u2022Tritan\u2122 Renew copolyesters \u2022Acetate Renew cellulosic biopolymers \u2022Tr\u0113va\u2122 Renew cellulosic biopolymers \u2022Cristal\u2122 Renew copolyesters \u2022Naia\u2122 Renew cellulosic yarn \u2022Aventa\u2122 Renew cellulosic biopolymers  \u2022Eastman expects the methanolysis manufacturing plant in Kingsport, Tennessee to begin commissioning and startup activities by early summer 2023, and approximately 75 percent of required feedstock for the facility is being procured today, under contract, or in active negotiation; \u2022Eastman made significant progress in 2022 on a material-to-material molecular recycling facility in Port-J\u00e9r\u00f4me-sur-Seine, France. This facility will use Eastman's polyester renewal technology to initially recycle up to 110,000 metric tons annually of hard-to-recycle plastic waste. Additionally, a long-term supply agreement was reached in September 2022 that will provide up to 20,000 metric tons per year of feedstock for this facility; and 8 8  8   \u2022Eastman reached a definitive supply agreement in October 2022 for a planned third molecular recycling facility that will be located in the United States. \u2022Caring for Society:  \u2022Tetrashield\u2122 performance polyester resins provide Bisphenol A-non intent (\"BPA-NI\") can coating for food and beverage applications; \u2022Animal nutrition solutions, including Eastman organic acids and proprietary feed additives for feeding the world, are antibiotic free; \u2022Saflex\u2122 PVB and HUD acoustic interlayers in the automotive sector are essential to ensure passenger safety. Eastman's materials enable the adoption of digital technologies within the cabin and further advance improvements in solar, heat, and ultraviolet management; and \u2022Eastman medical polymers provide quality and durability to healthcare providers while ensuring safety for their patients.   FINANCIAL STRATEGY  In its management of the Company's businesses and growth initiatives, management is committed to maintaining a strong financial position with appropriate financial flexibility and liquidity. Management believes maintaining a financial profile that supports an investment grade credit rating is important to its long-term strategy and financial flexibility. The Company employs a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation and deployment of cash. The priorities for uses of available cash include payment of the quarterly dividend, funding targeted growth opportunities, repurchasing shares, and repayment of debt.

The CI segment sells excess intermediates beyond the Company's internal specialty needs into end-markets such as industrial chemicals and processing, building and construction, health and wellness, and agrochemicals. Key technology platforms include acetyls, oxos, plasticizers, polyesters, and alkylamines.   The CI segment product lines benefit from competitive cost positions primarily resulting from the use of and access to lower cost raw materials, and the Company's scale, technology, and operational excellence. Examples include coal used in the production of cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl stream product lines, propylene and ethylene used in the production of olefin derivative product lines such as oxo alcohols and plasticizers, and ammonia and methanol used to manufacture methylamines. The CI segment also provides superior reliability to customers through its backward integration into readily available raw materials, such as propane, ethane, coal, and propylene. See \"Eastman Chemical Company General Information - Manufacturing Streams\".  Several CI segment product lines are affected by cyclicality, most notably olefin and acetyl-based products. This cyclicality is caused by periods of supply and demand imbalance, when either incremental capacity additions are not offset by corresponding increases in demand, or when demand exceeds existing supply. While management continues to take steps to reduce the impact of the trough of these cycles, future results are expected to fluctuate due to both general economic conditions and industry supply and demand.

Lanxess AG    propane propylene paraxylene   See Exhibit 99.01 for CI segment revenue by end-use market.  13 13  13   Strategy  To maintain and enhance its status as a low-cost producer and optimize earnings, the CI segment continuously focuses on cost control, operational efficiency, and capacity utilization. This includes focusing on products used internally by other operating segments, thereby supporting growth in specialty product lines throughout the Company, and also external licensing opportunities. Through the CI segment, the Company has leveraged the advantage of its highly integrated manufacturing facilities. Scale and feedstock versatility at the Kingsport, Tennessee manufacturing facility allows for competitive advantage in the production of acetic anhydride and other acetyl derivatives. At the Longview, Texas manufacturing site, Eastman uses its proprietary oxo technology in one of the world's largest single-site oxo butyraldehyde manufacturing facilities to produce a wide range of alcohols and other derivative products utilizing local propane and ethane supplies and purchased propylene. The Pace, Florida manufacturing facility, which uses ammonia and methanol feedstocks, is one of the world's largest methylamine production sites in the world. These integrated facilities, combined with large scale production processes and a continuous focus on additional process improvements, allow the CI segment product lines to remain cost competitive and, for some products, cost-advantaged as compared to competitors. Use of refinery-grade propylene (\"RGP\") in the feedstock mix of the olefin cracking units at the Longview, Texas manufacturing site reduces the amount of other purchased feedstocks. This results in a decrease in ethylene production and excess ethylene sales while maintaining historical levels of propylene production, providing flexibility to reduce participation in the merchant ethylene market, and retaining a cost-advantaged integrated propylene position to support specialty derivatives throughout the Company.   FIBERS SEGMENT  Overview   In the Fibers segment, Eastman manufactures and sells acetate tow and triacetin plasticizers for use in filtration media, primarily cigarette filters; cellulosic staple fibers and filament yarn for use in apparel, home furnishings, and industrial fabrics; nonwoven media for use in filtration and friction applications, used primarily in transportation, industrial, and agricultural end-markets; and cellulose acetate flake and acetyl raw materials for other acetate fiber producers. The Company is the world's largest producer of acetate yarn and has been in this business for over 85 years.   The Fibers segment's competitive strengths include a reputation for high-quality products, technical expertise, large scale vertically-integrated processes, reliability of supply, internally produced acetate flake supply for Fibers segment's products, a reputation for customer service excellence, and a customer base characterized by strategic long-term customers and end-user relationships. The Company continues to capitalize and build on these strengths to further improve the strategic position of its Fibers segment. To strengthen and stabilize segment earnings, the Company has taken actions such as the establishment of long-term variable pricing in acetate tow customer arrangements and agreements, development of innovative textile and nonwoven applications, and repurposing manufacturing capacity from acetate tow to new products.  The 10 largest Fibers segment customers accounted for approximately 60 percent of the segment's 2022 sales revenue, and include multinational as well as regional cigarette producers, fabric manufacturers, and other acetate fiber producers.\u00a0  The Company's long history and experience in fibers markets are reflected in the Fibers segment's operating expertise, both within the Company and in support of its customers' processes. The Fibers segment's knowledge of the industry and of customers' processes allows it to assist its customers in maximizing their processing efficiencies, promoting repeat sales, and developing mutually beneficial, long-term customer relationships.  The Company's fully integrated fibers manufacturing process employs unique technology that allows it to use a broad range of high-purity wood pulps for which the Company has dependable sources of supply.  14 14  14   Principal ProductsProductDescriptionPrincipalCompetitorsKey RawMaterialsEnd-Use ApplicationsAcetate TowEstron\u2122cellulose acetate towCelanese CorporationCerdia InternationalDaicel Corporationwood pulpmethanolhigh sulfur coalfiltration media (primarily cigarette filters) Acetate Yarn and FiberNaia\u2122Estron\u2122natural (undyed) acetate yarnsolution dyed acetate yarnstaple fiberUAB Dirbtinis Pluostas Lenzing AGAditya Birla Groupwood pulpmethanolhigh sulfur coalwaste plastics and textilesconsumables (apparel, home furnishings, and industrial fabrics)health and wellness (medical tape)Acetyl Chemical ProductsEstrobond\u2122triacetincellulose acetate flakeacetic acidacetic anhydrideJiangsu Ruijia Chemistry Co., Ltd.Polynt SpADaicel CorporationCelanese CorporationCerdia Internationalwood pulpmethanolhigh sulfur coalfiltration media (primarily cigarette filters) NonwovensNonwovenswetlaid nonwoven mediaspecialty and engineered paperscellulose acetate fiberHollingsworth and Vose CompanyLydall, Inc.BorgWarner Inc.natural and synthetic fibersinorganic and metallic additivesresinsfiltration and friction media for transportationindustrialagriculture and miningaerospace markets Estron\u2122 Celanese Corporation Cerdia International Daicel Corporation  wood pulp methanol high sulfur coal Naia\u2122 Estron\u2122 natural (undyed) acetate yarn solution dyed acetate yarn staple fiber  UAB Dirbtinis Pluostas  Lenzing AG Aditya Birla Group wood pulp methanol high sulfur coal waste plastics and textiles consumables (apparel, home furnishings, and industrial fabrics) health and wellness (medical tape) Estrobond\u2122 triacetin cellulose acetate flake acetic acid acetic anhydride  Jiangsu Ruijia Chemistry Co., Ltd.

BorgWarner Inc. natural and synthetic fibers inorganic and metallic additives resins  filtration and friction media for transportation industrial agriculture and mining aerospace markets  Strategy   Management applies the innovation-driven growth model to the Fibers segment by leveraging its strong customer relationships and industry knowledge to maintain a leading industry position in the global market. The segment benefits from a state-of-the-art, world class, acetate flake production facility at the Kingsport, Tennessee site, which is supplied from Eastman's vertically integrated coal gasification facility and is the largest and most integrated acetate tow site in the world. The Fibers segment also expects to benefit from Eastman's recently developed carbon renewal technology, which enables the substitution of fossil fuel feedstock with recycled waste content. Products using this technology are marketed and sold under the \"Renew\" product designation. See \"Corporate Overview - Business Strategy - Sustainability and Circular Economy\". The Company supplies 100 percent of the acetate flake raw material to the manufacturing facility of its acetate tow joint venture in China from the Company's manufacturing facility in Kingsport, Tennessee, which the Company recognizes in sales revenue. The Company recognizes earnings in the joint venture through its equity investment, reported in \"Other (income) charges, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Company's focus on innovation has resulted in repurposing some of its acetate tow manufacturing capacity to fibers products for textiles, resulting in increased capacity utilization and lower acetate tow costs.  To meet customers' evolving needs and further improve the Fibers segment's manufacturing process efficiencies, the Company makes use of its capabilities in fibers technology to maintain a strong focus on incremental product and process improvements.  In 2022, the Fibers segment:  \u2022implemented variable pricing agreements across the acetate tow customer base, driving growth and returning adjusted EBIT margins and cash flow generation to acceptable performance levels; \u2022commercialized Naia\u2122 staple fiber for spun yarns for apparel and home textiles; and \u2022announced several high-profile brand adoptions, including a major multinational clothing company; an American retailer of outdoor clothing; and a sustainable women's clothing and accessories designer and manufacturer.  15 15  15   The Fibers segment R&D efforts focus on serving new and existing customers, leveraging proprietary cellulosic biopolymers and spinning technology, optimizing asset productivity through process improvement, selective product innovation in response to acetate tow customer needs, and working with suppliers to reduce costs. For textiles, the Fibers segment is offsetting declines in acetate tow through investments in differentiated application development capabilities and new product innovations, including circular solutions, to drive growth in textiles and apparel of Naia\u2122 yarns and fibers.   EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY GENERAL INFORMATION  Seasonality  Eastman's earnings are typically higher in the second and third quarters, and cash flows from operations are typically highest in the second half of the year due to seasonal demand based on general economic activity in the Company's key markets as described in \"Business Segments\". Results in all segments except the Fibers segment are typically weaker in the fourth quarter due to seasonal downturns in key markets.  The coatings additives product line of the AFP segment and the intermediates product line of the CI segment are impacted by the cyclicality of key end products and markets, while other operating segments and product lines are more sensitive to global economic conditions. Eastman is exposed to consumer discretionary end-markets and changes in global consumer spending, particularly in the AM and AFP segments. Supply and demand dynamics determine profitability at different stages of business cycles and global economic conditions affect the length of each cycle.  Sales, Marketing, and Distribution  Eastman markets and sells products primarily through a global marketing and sales organization which has a presence in the United States and approximately 30 other countries selling into more than 100 countries around the world. The Company focuses its market engagement on attractive niche markets, leveraging disruptive macro trends, and market activation throughout the value chain with both customers and downstream users. Eastman's strategy is to target industries and markets where the Company can leverage its application development expertise to develop product offerings to provide differentiated value that address current and future customer and market needs. The Company's strategic marketing approach and capabilities leverage the Company's insights about trends, markets, and customers to drive development of specialty products. Through a highly skilled and specialized sales force that is capable of providing differentiated product solutions, Eastman strives to be the preferred supplier in the Company's targeted markets.  The Company's products are also marketed through indirect channels, which include dealers and contract representatives. Sales outside the United States tend to be made more frequently through dealers and contract representatives than sales in the United States. The combination of direct and indirect sales channels, including sales online through its Customer Center website, allows Eastman to reliably serve customers throughout the world.  The Company's products are shipped to customers and to downstream users directly from Eastman manufacturing plants and distribution centers worldwide.  Research and Development  Management applies its innovation-driven growth model to leverage the Company's world class scalable technology platforms that provide a competitive advantage and the foundation for sustainable earnings growth. The Company's R&D strategy for sustainable growth through innovation includes multi-generational product development for specialty products, faster and more differentiated product development by leveraging global application development capabilities, and the creation of value through integration of multiple technology platforms. The Company's innovation strategy is guided by the need to provide practical solutions to sustainability macro-drivers that will improve the quality of life globally through material solutions. This strategy has been accelerated by enhancements of global differentiated application development capabilities that position Eastman as a strategic element of customers' success within attractive niche markets. See examples of recent product and technology innovations in \"Corporate Overview - Business Strategy - Innovation\".  16 16  16   Eastman manages certain growth initiatives and costs at the corporate level, including certain R&D costs not allocated to any one operating segment. The Company uses a stage-gating process, which is a disciplined decision-making framework for evaluating targeted opportunities, with a number of projects at various stages of development. As projects meet milestones, additional amounts are spent on those projects. The Company continues to explore and invest in R&D initiatives such as high-performance materials and opportunities created by disruptive macro trends including sustainability and development of a more \"circular economy\". See \"Corporate Overview - Business Strategy - Sustainability and Circular Economy\".  Manufacturing Streams  Integral to Eastman's strategy for growth is leveraging its heritage expertise and innovation in polyester, cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl, alkylamine, and olefins chemistries in key markets, including transportation, building and construction, consumables, and agriculture. For each of these chemistries, Eastman has developed and acquired a combination of assets and technologies that are operated within four manufacturing \"streams\", combining scale and integration across multiple manufacturing units and sites as a competitive advantage.  \u2022In the polyester stream, the Company begins with paraxylene, ethylene glycol, and integrated feedstocks, converting them through a series of intermediate materials to ultimately produce clear, tough, chemically resistant copolyesters. The Company is enhancing the polyester stream by investing in the multiple plastic-to-plastic polyester renewal facilities to enable various waste plastics to be recycled into high quality, specialty copolyester Renew products. Polyester stream products are converted for end-uses in cosmetics and personal care, medical device, durable goods, and food packaging industries. \u2022In the cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl stream, the Company begins with gasification of fossil fuels with oxygen. The resulting synthesis gas is converted into acetic acid and acetic anhydride. Cellulosic biopolymers derivative manufacturing at the Company begins with natural polymers, sourced from sustainably-managed forests, which, when combined with acetyl and olefin chemicals, provide differentiated product lines. Through a new recycling innovation, carbon renewal technology is now enabling the recycling of complex plastics to the basic building blocks of Eastman's cellulosic product stream. The major end-markets for products from the cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl stream include coatings, displays, and thermoplastics. \u2022In the alkylamines stream, the Company begins with ammonia and alcohol feedstocks to produce methylamines and higher alkylamines, which can then be further converted into alkylamine derivatives. The Company's alkylamines products are primarily used in agriculture, water treatment, consumables, animal nutrition, and oil and gas end-markets. \u2022In the olefins stream, the Company begins primarily with propane and ethane, which are thermally \"cracked\" (the process whereby hydrocarbon molecules are broken down and rearranged) into ethylene and propylene in cracking units at its site in Longview, Texas. As a result of modifications completed in 2018, these units also offer flexibility to use refinery-grade propylene (\"RGP\") as a diversified feedstock to minimize the impact of olefins spread volatility. The Company purchases some additional propylene to supplement cracking unit production. Propylene derivative products are used in a variety of items such as paints and coatings, automotive safety glass, and non-phthalate plasticizers. Ethylene derivative products are converted for end-uses in the food industry, health and beauty products, detergents, and automotive products.  The Company leverages its expertise and innovation in cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl, olefins, polyester, and alkylamine chemistries and technologies to meet demand and create new uses and opportunities for the Company's products in key markets. Through integration and optimization across these streams, the Company is able to create unique and differentiated products that have a performance advantage over competitive materials.  Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Energy  Eastman purchases a majority of its key raw materials and energy through different contract mechanisms, generally of one to three years in initial duration with renewal or cancellation options for each party. Most of these agreements do not require the Company to purchase materials or energy if its operations are reduced or idle. The cost of raw materials and energy is generally based on market price at the time of purchase; however, from time to time Eastman uses derivative financial instruments for certain key raw materials to mitigate the impact of market price fluctuations. Key raw materials include propane, propylene, paraxylene, methanol, cellulosic biopolymers, fatty alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol, and a wide variety of precursors for specialty organic chemicals. Key purchased energy sources include natural gas, coal, and electricity. The Company has multiple suppliers for most key raw materials and energy and uses quality management principles, such as the establishment of long-term relationships with suppliers and ongoing performance assessments and benchmarking, as part of its supplier selection process. When appropriate, the Company purchases raw materials from a single source supplier to maximize quality and reduce cost and has contingency plans to minimize the potential impact of any supply disruptions from single source suppliers.  17 17  17   While temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur, these items are generally sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements. However, their continuous availability and cost are subject to unscheduled plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand, domestic and world market conditions, changes in government regulation, supply chain disruption, the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic (\"COVID-19\"), natural disasters, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism or other political factors, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure. Eastman's operations or products have been in the past, and may be in the future, adversely affected by these factors. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report. The Company's raw material and energy costs as a percent of total cost of operations were approximately 55 percent in 2022. For additional information about raw materials, see Exhibit 99.02 \"Product and Raw Material Information\" of this Annual Report.  Intellectual Property, Trademarks, and Licensing  While Eastman's intellectual property portfolio is an important Company asset which it expands and vigorously protects globally through a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, neither its business as a whole nor any particular operating segment is materially dependent upon any one particular patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secret. As a producer of a broad range of advanced materials, specialty additives, chemicals, and fibers, Eastman owns over 800 active United States patents and over 1,400 active foreign patents, expiring at various times over several years, and owns over 4,800 active worldwide trademark applications and registrations. As the laws of many countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States, Eastman cannot ensure that it will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property assets outside the United States. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.  The Company pursues opportunities to license proprietary technology to third parties where it has determined that the competitive impact to its businesses will be minimal. These arrangements typically are structured to require payments at significant project milestones such as signing, completion of design, and start-up.  Information Security  The Company employs information systems to support its business, enable transformation and deploy digital services. The Company utilizes a risk-based, multi-layered information security approach following the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, including (a) dedicated security operations center monitoring, (b) network-based and host-based protections, (c) a Privacy Council focused upon adherence to privacy regulations, (d) privilege access management controls, (e) annual and on-going information security training and targeted exercises, (f) encryption of data, backup, recovery, and testing, (g) regular internal and external audits against information security best practices, and (h) benchmarking utilizing external third parties. As with other industry participants, the Company from time to time experiences attempted cyber-attacks of its information systems. None of these attempts have resulted in a material adverse impact on the Company's operations or financial results, any penalties, or settlements. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.  Senior management, including the Chief Information Officer (\"CIO\"), reviews information security performance and recent cybersecurity industry trends at least quarterly, and at least annually reviews the Company's information security strategy with executive management.  Under the Company's enterprise-wide approach to risk management, cyber security and security of company information is a \"high-priority\" risk that is reported to and overseen by the Board of Directors. The CIO provides an overview of information security performance and recent cybersecurity industry trends to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis throughout the year.  Human Capital  To keep solving complex problems and growing its business, the Company must continue to attract, develop, and retain exceptional people (\"human capital\"), and motivate them to excel. Strong workforce and leadership development, succession management, an inclusive culture that brings out the best in every individual and competitive compensation and benefits are vital to the success of Eastman's innovation-driven growth strategy. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors oversees workforce and senior management development and the Board of Directors monitors the culture of the Company and leadership quality, morale, and development.  18 18  18   Eastman places a strong emphasis on the health, safety and well-being of employees \u2014 both at work and at home. Eastman's \"zero-incident mindset\" takes a holistic approach to people and processes by fostering the right behaviors, values, and culture to ensure that employees are operating responsibly, accountably, and safely. In addition to annual process and personal safety performance expectations (see \"Executive Compensation\" in Part III, Item 11 of this Annual Report), safety and wellness protocols continue to be included for protection against the COVID-19 virus for employees.   The Company's focus on well-being also includes physical, emotional, and financial health of employees and their families, with on-site and on-demand resources such as fitness classes, health coaches, and financial counselors. In 2022, the Company conducted a benefits equity study to better understand the needs of its employees in the current environment. Through this work, the Company continues to explore new ways to make benefits more equitable and inclusive and more attractive in a diverse talent marketplace. The Company also continues to provide global flexibility principles and resources to emphasize the importance of balancing work and personal responsibilities.  Breakthroughs require creativity and unconventional ideas, and that takes diverse perspectives and an environment that empowers everyone to speak their mind and add value, so their ideas can get translated into plans and actions. As Eastman develops new products to meet today's most pressing needs, the Company inspires innovative ideas by making every team member feel valued and empowered to do their best work. Eastman's capacity to innovate and transform depends on its ability to attract and retain the best and brightest talent. Building an inclusive workplace, powered by a diverse global employee population of approximately 14,500 people worldwide is key to promoting innovation and driving results.  The table below shows the percentage of the Company's global employee population by region.   United States and Canada72\u00a0%Europe, Middle East, and Africa15\u00a0%Asia Pacific10\u00a0%Latin America3\u00a0%Total100\u00a0%  Eastman's focus on inclusion and diversity transcends race and gender. To execute the growth strategy, the Company needs to attract, develop, and retain people of all backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. Eastman believes transparency is an important part of creating accountability and driving progress. To that end, the Company has set clear goals to achieve gender parity in professional and leadership roles globally and to be an industry leader in racial and ethnic diversity in the United States by 2030. In 2022, the Company's female representation globally was 39 percent in professional level roles, 28 percent in leadership roles, and 25 percent at the executive level. In the United States, the Company's racially and ethnically diverse talent was 14 percent at both professional and leadership levels, and 13 percent at the executive level. The non-employee directors of Eastman's Board of Directors are 30 percent female and 20 percent racially and ethnically diverse. See \"Information About our Executive Officers\" in Part I of this Annual Report and \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\"\u2014 \"Election of Directors\" in Part III, Item 10 of this Annual Report for more information.  Eastman Resource Groups (\"ERGs\") are uniquely positioned to bring the Company's Inclusion & Diversity strategy to life through their insights and access to key populations to make sure every team member feels valued, respected, and able to perform at their full potential. Chaired by a team member and sponsored by a senior executive, each ERG is dedicated to helping its members bridge cultural gaps, grow professionally and maximize business contributions. All Eastman team members are encouraged to join or participate in any or multiple ERGs, either as a member of the target community or as an ally.   Eastman's compensation philosophy, principles and processes are designed to ensure the Company pays competitively in the market for top talent and that the pay is distributed fairly and consistently. An independent third party assesses pay equity each year by comparing pay for people in the same jobs, job levels, and locations. This analysis, which considers gender, race and ethnicity (in the U.S.), performance, tenure, specialty skills, and educational credentials, is completed during the annual compensation review process, when leadership makes pay decisions.  19 19  19   Customers  Eastman has an extensive customer base and, while it is not dependent on any one customer, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect the Company until such business is replaced. The top 100 customers accounted for approximately 55 percent of the Company's 2022 sales revenue. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the Company's consolidated sales revenue during 2022.  Compliance With Environmental and Other Government Regulations  The Company is subject to significant and complex governmental laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance and may, depending on specific facts and circumstances, impact the Company's competitive position. (See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Factors -- Legislative, regulatory, or voluntary actions, including associated with physical impacts of climate change, could increase the Company's future health, safety, and environmental compliance costs.\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.) These include health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations; site security regulations; chemical control laws; laws protecting intellectual property; privacy, data sharing and data protection laws; laws regulating energy generation and distribution, such as utilities, pipelines and co-generation facilities; and customs laws and laws regulating import and export of products and technology. As described below, the most significant environmental capital and other expenditures are for compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. In addition to these regulations, compliance with chemical control laws (including the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act, the U.S. Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and similar non-U.S. counterparts, and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (\"REACH\") program in the European Union) and laws protecting intellectual property (see \"Intellectual Property, Trademarks, and Licensing\") have the most impact on the Company's day-to-day operations and competitive position.  Environmental  The Company is subject to laws, regulations, and legal requirements relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal, remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which it does business. These health, safety, and environmental considerations are a priority in the Company's planning for all existing and new products and processes. The Environmental, Safety, and Sustainability Committee of Eastman's Board of Directors oversees the Company's policies and practices concerning health, safety, and the environment and its processes for complying with related laws and regulations and monitors related matters.  The Company's policy is to operate its plants and facilities in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations such that it protects the environment and the health and safety of its employees and the public. The Company intends to continue to make expenditures for environmental protection and improvements in a timely manner consistent with its policies and with available technology. In some cases, applicable environmental regulations such as those adopted under the Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and related actions of regulatory agencies determine the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by the Company. Likewise, any new legislation or regulations related to GHG gas emissions, energy or climate change, or the repeal of such legislation or regulations, could impact the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by the Company.  The Company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In some instances, the amount cannot be reasonably estimated due to insufficient information, particularly as to the nature and timing of future expenditures. In these cases, the liability is monitored until such time that sufficient information exists. With respect to a contaminated site, the amount accrued reflects liabilities expected to be paid out within approximately 30 years as well as the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.
