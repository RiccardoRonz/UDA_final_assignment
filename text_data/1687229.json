{"cik": 1687229, "item_1A": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Invitation Homes is a leading owner and operator of single-family homes for lease, offering residents high-quality homes in sought-after neighborhoods across the United States. With over 80,000 homes for lease in 16 markets across the country as of December\u00a031, 2022, we are meeting the needs of a growing share of Americans who prefer the ease of a leasing lifestyle over the burden of owning a home. We provide our residents access to updated homes with features they value, as well as close proximity to jobs and access to good schools. The continued demand for our product proves that the choice and flexibility we offer is attractive to many prospective residents. We operate in markets with strong demand drivers, high barriers to entry, and high rent growth potential, primarily in the Western United States, Florida, and the Southeast United States. Through disciplined market and asset selection, as well as through strategic mergers and acquisitions, we designed our portfolio to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated. Since our founding in 2012, we have built a proven, vertically integrated operating platform that enables us to effectively and efficiently acquire, renovate, lease, maintain, and manage our homes.  Our homes average approximately 1,870 square feet with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than a typical multifamily resident. We invest in the upfront renovation of homes in our portfolio in order to address capital needs, reduce ongoing maintenance costs, and drive resident demand.  At Invitation Homes, we are committed to creating a better way to live and to being a force for positive change, while at the same time advancing efforts that make our company more innovative and our processes more sustainable. Environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) initiatives are an important part of our strategic business objectives and are critical to our long-term success. Our mission statement, \u201cTogether with you, we make a house a home,\u201d reflects our commitment to high-touch customer service that continuously enhances residents\u2019 living experiences and provides homes where individuals and families can thrive. Each aspect of our operations \u2014 whether in our corporate headquarters or field offices located in our 16 markets \u2014 is driven by a resident-centric model. Our associates take our values seriously and work hard every day to honor the trust our residents have placed in us to provide clean, safe, and functional homes for them and their loved ones. In turn, we focus on ensuring that our associates are fairly compensated and that we provide a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture where they are appreciated for who they are and what they bring to the business. We also place a strong emphasis on the impact we have in our communities and to the environment in general, and we continue to develop programs that demonstrate that commitment. In addition, we ensure that we operate under strong, well-defined governance practices and adhere to the highest ethical standards at all times.  Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented and continue to follow, as appropriate, a host of measures to ensure continuity of our business operations and services while protecting our associates and residents. While our business has not been materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to monitor the situation for any potential impact on various aspects of our business.  History Through certain of the six holding entities that owned our business prior to our initial public offering (the \u201cIH\u00a0Holding Entities\u201d), we commenced operations in 2012. On January\u00a031, 2017, we effected certain reorganization transactions that resulted in INVH\u00a0LP holding, directly or indirectly, all of the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Manager and the full portfolio of homes owned by the IH\u00a0Holding Entities. As a result of the reorganization transactions, INVH\u00a0LP became a consolidated subsidiary of INVH. A wholly owned subsidiary of INVH, Invitation Homes OP\u00a0GP\u00a0LLC (the \u201cGeneral Partner\u201d), serves as INVH\u00a0LP\u2019s sole general partner.  8 8 8   Invitation Homes Inc., a Maryland corporation, was incorporated in Delaware on October\u00a04, 2016. On February\u00a06, 2017, Invitation Homes Inc. changed its jurisdiction of incorporation to Maryland and completed an initial public offering of its shares of common stock (the \u201cIPO\u201d). On November\u00a016, 2017, we completed the Mergers with SWH, whereby we acquired all outstanding SWH common shares. As of December\u00a031, 2022, INVH owns a 99.7% partnership interest in INVH\u00a0LP and has the full, exclusive, and complete responsibility for and discretion over the day-to-day management and control of INVH\u00a0LP. Our principal executive offices are located at 1717 Main Street, Suite 2000, Dallas, Texas 75201, and our telephone number is (972)\u00a0421-3600. Our Platform Our vertically integrated, scalable platform allows greater influence over the experience of our residents while enabling us to better control operating costs and continuously share best practices across functional areas of the business. Our differentiated platform is built upon:  \u2022Resident-centric focus. Our high-touch business model enables us to continuously solicit and integrate resident feedback into our operations and tailor our approach to address their preferences, providing a superior living experience and fostering customer loyalty. We believe this, in turn, drives rent growth, occupancy, and low turnover rates and will enable us to develop significant brand equity in the longer term. \u2022Local presence and expertise. In-market managers oversee the operations of local leasing, property management, and maintenance teams, enabling us to provide outstanding resident service, leverage local expertise in managing rental, occupancy, and turnover rates, and improve cost and oversight of renovations and ongoing maintenance of our homes. As a result of our concentrated footprint within our markets, our regional managers and in-market teams are able to realize local-operator advantages, while still benefiting from significant economies of scale. \u2022Scalable, centralized infrastructure. We support local market operations with national strategy, infrastructure, and standards to drive efficiency, consistency, and cost savings. We utilize our extensive scale to ensure the consistent quality of our resident experience and maximize cost efficiencies and purchasing power. On a national level we are also able to standardize resident leases, employ a consistent approach to resident screening and leasing operations, and utilize dynamic, rules-based pricing tools informed by local market conditions. Our approach to investment and asset management similarly combines local presence and expertise with national oversight. Our investment and asset management teams are located in-market and apply their local market knowledge within the framework of a proprietary and consistent underwriting methodology, with support from national leadership focused on investment and asset management strategy based in our corporate headquarters. Through the integration of investment and asset management and property management functions, our platform enables our teams to incorporate real-time information regarding leasing activity, property operations, maintenance, and capital spending into asset selection and asset management. We believe the advantages of our integrated acquisition platform and local market expertise have driven the quality of our existing total portfolio of 83,113 homes as of December\u00a031, 2022. We similarly believe that employing experienced, in-house acquisitions teams at the local level gives us a competitive advantage in selectively acquiring homes that will maximize risk-adjusted total return.  Our Business Activities Since our founding in 2012, we have built a proven, vertically integrated operating platform that allows us to effectively and efficiently acquire, renovate, lease, maintain, and manage both the homes we own as well as those we manage on behalf of others, including our joint venture partners. Our differentiated approach, which combines a resident-centric focus, local market presence and expertise, and national strategy, infrastructure, and standards, informs all areas of our operations.  9 9 9   Property Operations Property operations encompasses the in-house local market management and execution of marketing, leasing, resident relations, and maintenance functions. We have developed and employ a highly scalable, vertically integrated, and resident-centric property management service platform, referred to as \u201cProCare.\u201d All of our property management functions have been internally managed since our founding in 2012, and we have implemented an extensive property management infrastructure, including an online resident portal, smart home technology, a mobile app for residents to schedule and track maintenance requests, a technology suite to manage work orders and associate schedules, dedicated in-market associates, and local offices in each of our markets.  We have organized our property management associates and operating structure such that Vice Presidents of Operations in each of our markets are responsible for the operations of local leasing, property management, and maintenance teams. We believe our operating model differentiates our approach to local market operations and enables us to provide superior, high-touch resident service, maximize the effectiveness of our in-market associates in managing rental, occupancy, and turnover rates and improve our cost management and oversight over both upfront renovations and ongoing maintenance. All of our local market associates are supported by our centralized national infrastructure, which allows us to deploy best practices and standardization where appropriate. The combination of our local market presence and national infrastructure enables us to exercise greater control over our property management service platform, allowing us to enhance the experience of our residents, better manage operating costs, and share best practices across various functional areas of our business. Marketing and Leasing Our associates are responsible for establishing rental rates, marketing and leasing properties, and collecting and processing rent. We establish and manage rental rates based on a dynamic, rules-based pricing tool that is informed by local market conditions, including a competitive analysis of market rents for institutional single-family rental properties, growth in single-family market rents since a specific home\u2019s last lease commenced, the size, fit and finish, and location of the home, the number of applications received, and the number of days a home has been available on the market. We also consider a number of qualitative factors, such as neighborhood characteristics, community amenities, and proximity to employment centers, desirable schools, transportation corridors, and local services. We typically begin pre-marketing properties 30 to 45 days in advance of their becoming vacant to maintain high occupancy rates and reduce vacancy losses. We advertise available properties through multiple channels, including our proprietary website, internet listing services (such as Zillow, Trulia, HotPads, and Realtor.com), Multiple Listing Service (\u201cMLS\u201d), yard signs, search engine marketing, social and other digital media, and local brokers. We offer flexible showing options for convenience, including virtual tours and floor plans on our website, self-showings that leverage the home\u2019s smart home technology, and in-person showings. We own internal brokerages to serve each state in which we operate and utilize in-market leasing experience specialists to drive an end-to-end resident experience that achieves our occupancy, revenue, and retention goals while facilitating enjoyment of a worry-free leasing lifestyle. Prospective residents may submit an application through the application portal on our website. To maintain brand consistency and better track compliance with leasing requirements, we utilize standardized online applications, national lease agreements, move-in and move-out documents, resident communications, and other ancillary documents. We evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of a third party resident screening partner. Our resident screening process includes obtaining appropriate identification, a thorough evaluation of credit history and household income, a review of the applicant\u2019s rental history, and a background check for criminal activity. Although we require a minimum income to rent ratio, many additional factors are also taken into consideration during the resident evaluation process, including eviction history, criminal history, and rental and other payment history.  Our disciplined investment strategy and local, in-market approach have given us scale and density of homes in desirable neighborhoods, enabling us to execute cost-effective advertising targeting potential residents whose online behaviors indicate interest in these neighborhoods. We believe this approach increases our likelihood of capturing and retaining residents and enhances our opportunity to develop and market other programs and services.  10 10 10   Digital Marketing Initiatives and Branding We encourage meaningful community interaction across our digital platforms by continuously refreshing the content of our website, blog, and social media accounts with articles, home maintenance advice, contests, and incentives designed to enrich the lives of our residents and protect our homes. For example, we alert our residents to prepare for storms, incentivize them to pay their rent online, offer \u201cLease Friendly\u201d and \u201cMake It Home\u201d design tips and contests, and hold an annual Resident Appreciation Month. Resident engagement and social following continue to grow, and we receive positive feedback from residents, who specifically mention our approachable lifestyle and home maintenance content that helps them make a house a home. Resident Relations and Property Maintenance The associates in each of our markets are responsible for property repairs and maintenance and resident relations. In coordination with a third party vendor, we offer a 24/7 emergency telephone line to handle after-hours maintenance issues on an expedited basis as needed, and our residents can also contact us through our online mobile app, our resident portal, our call centers, or our local property management offices. As part of our ongoing property management process, we seek to conduct routine repairs and maintenance in a timely manner, as appropriate, by appointment at the resident\u2019s convenience. We seek to utilize quality materials to minimize the recurrence of maintenance requests and maximize long-term rental income and cash flows from our portfolio.  We typically utilize our in-house maintenance associates in each of our markets to provide ordinary course, \u201chandyman\u201d services, and outsource more complex or extensive repairs, such as roofing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (\u201cHVAC\u201d) systems, plumbing, and electrical work to vetted, pre-approved third party vendor partners. We strive to maximize the number of maintenance calls that are addressed by our in-house maintenance technicians. In cases where we outsource more complex or extensive repairs, our in-house maintenance associates provide oversight to ensure quality control and cost effectiveness. In addition, our in-house maintenance associates conduct periodic ProCare visits to our properties to help foster positive, long-term relationships with our residents, track and report maintenance needs effectively, conduct preventive maintenance, and ensure compliance with lease terms, local laws, and HOA rules and regulations.  ProCare service, our proactive property management service platform, includes several touchpoints over the term of a resident\u2019s lease designed to enhance their satisfaction with our service model, improve the efficiency of our service and our homes\u2019 systems, and ensure that each resident is properly educated regarding the home and their responsibilities. When a new resident moves into one of our homes, our associates conduct a resident orientation during which we revisit the terms of the lease, outline what aspects of the home\u2019s upkeep are the resident\u2019s responsibility, walk through all of the home\u2019s major systems in order to familiarize the resident with their safe and proper operation, and inform the resident that we will be conducting a post move-in maintenance visit. Following the move-in orientation, each resident is encouraged to keep a record of any non-emergency service items. At the time of the post move-in maintenance visit approximately 45 days after move-in, our in-house property maintenance associates will address any non-emergency service needs the resident has noted. We believe this process has a number of benefits. First, by conducting an in-person move-in orientation, we are able to ensure that residents understand their obligations under the terms of their lease, as well as how to safely and properly operate the home\u2019s systems, reducing both the likelihood of misaligned expectations and unnecessary wear and tear on the property. Second, by scheduling a post move-in maintenance visit, we are able to address multiple service requests in a single visit, improving the resident experience by avoiding the inconvenience of multiple service appointments and improving the efficiency and productivity of our in-house property maintenance associates. Finally, the post move-in maintenance visit allows us to more quickly identify residents who may not be adhering to the terms of their lease or may be subjecting the home to undue wear and tear and/or damages as a result of their treatment of the property. Following the regularly scheduled post move-in maintenance visit described above, our in-house property maintenance associates in each of our markets seek to conduct preventive maintenance visits every six months during the life of a resident\u2019s stay in the home. During preventive maintenance visits, our in-house property maintenance associates inspect the home\u2019s systems, paying particular attention to potential safety hazards as well as potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed. Examples of areas of focus for preventive maintenance visits include smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, air filters, hot water heaters, toilet valves, under-sink plumbing, and garbage disposals, among others.  11 11 11   We also conduct pre-move-out visits 15 to 30 days prior to scheduled resident move-outs. These visits allow us to notify residents of any repairs they may need to undertake prior to moving out of the property, such as carpet cleaning or landscaping maintenance, in order to avoid forfeiture of part or all of their security deposit. In addition, these visits allow our in-house property maintenance associates to begin preparing a scope of work and budget for the turnover work we undertake between residents to prepare our homes to be re-leased to a new resident. These visits also improve our ability to pre-market our homes. Regardless of the purpose or timing of the visit, our in-house property maintenance associates are required to conduct a general property condition assessment (\u201cGPCA\u201d) every time they visit one of our homes. The GPCA requires our in-house property maintenance associates to assess and document interior and exterior conditions and whether the resident is adhering to the terms of their lease, as well as any potential safety hazards or potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed. If a deficiency is\u00a0identified by our in-house property maintenance associates we endeavor to take prompt action to correct it.  Investment and Asset Management Acquisition Strategy We have a disciplined acquisition platform that is capable of deploying capital across multiple acquisition channels and markets simultaneously. Our markets were generally selected through a robust process utilizing an analysis of housing and rental market supply and demand fundamentals, macroeconomic and demographic trends, and risk-adjusted total return potential. Specifically, the process we use to select and, on an ongoing basis, evaluate our markets ranks these markets based on relative weightings of factors that include, but are not limited to, forecast population and employment growth, household formation, historical and forecast deliveries of new residential housing supply, size of the addressable market, volume of new and existing home sales, potential yields implied by the relationship between market rental rates and the price of single-family residential housing, forecast home price appreciation, and forecast rental rate growth.  We have amassed significant scale within our 16 markets. In these markets, our acquisition strategy has been, and will continue to be, focused on buying, renovating, and operating high quality single-family homes for lease that we believe will appeal to and attract a high quality resident base, that will experience robust long-term demand, and that will benefit from capital appreciation. In evaluating acquisitions, we analyze numerous factors, including neighborhood desirability, proximity to employment centers, schools, and transportation corridors, community amenities, construction type, and required ongoing capital needs, among others. We target submarkets and neighborhoods in undersupplied high-growth markets and leverage our in-house acquisition and operations teams\u2019 local market expertise to acquire homes in desirable locations that we believe will experience above average rental rate growth and home price appreciation. Our in-house acquisition teams are comprised of dedicated professionals located in our markets and at our corporate headquarters who provide strategic direction and broad oversight. Our acquisition teams have significant local market experience and expertise in single-family investments and sales, which enables us to target specific submarkets, neighborhoods, individual streets, and homes that meet our selection and underwriting criteria. As part of our selective and disciplined investment approach, we have analyzed and considered a far greater number of potential acquisitions than the number of homes we have actually acquired. We thus have a substantial proprietary database from which we can draw as we evaluate future acquisition opportunities in our markets. As a result of our large existing portfolio and volume of acquisitions to date, we believe we have a high degree of visibility into rental rates and fixed and controllable operating expenses, which allows us to more accurately underwrite expected net yields of homes prior to acquisition. We also collaborate with local market real estate brokers and strategic third party technology platforms, which we leverage to source off-market acquisition opportunities. Within our markets, our approach allows us to screen broadly and rapidly to identify potential acquisitions in highly targeted submarkets at the neighborhood and street levels. Our in-house team of acquisition professionals coordinates with our in-house renovation, maintenance, and property management teams to ensure that feedback from historical acquisitions is shared across functions so that our ongoing investment activities are informed by, and benefit from, insight from prior experience. 12 12 12   Property Renovations We have an in-house team of dedicated associates located in our markets who oversee our upfront property renovation process and the ongoing maintenance of our homes, with support from centralized construction experts and infrastructure. This team works in collaboration with our in-house investment and property management teams to maximize the total return of our upfront investment and minimize ongoing maintenance costs. To this end, our professionals ensure the following are evaluated: the structural needs and major systems of a property (e.g., examining roofs, HVAC systems, and siding); other maintenance-reducing improvements and repairs (e.g., installing durable hard-surface flooring, removing carpet from high-traffic areas, and testing plumbing and pipes both in the home and out to the street); and the level of fit and finish required to maintain consistency with our brand standards and maximize rental demand (e.g., selecting cabinet and countertop finishes and appliances designed to improve resident demand).  In general, before a home is acquired or when an acquired home first becomes vacant, our in-house teams begin the renovation process by preparing a detailed renovation budget and scope of work based on an assessment of each property\u2019s major systems and structural features. These include HVAC, roofs, pools, and plumbing and electrical systems. In addition, we also evaluate other features of the home\u2019s fit and finish, including appliances, landscaping, decks and/or patios, and fixtures. During our initial assessment, we also determine the potential for, and potential return on, any value-additive upgrades that may reduce future operating costs or enhance rental demand and, by extension, our ability to realize more attractive rental, occupancy, or turnover rates.  We are able to drive cost efficiencies through local oversight of the entire process of renovating our homes by our associates. Each property\u2019s detailed budget and scope of work prepared by our in-house team of renovation professionals is reviewed and vetted by our operations teams, both locally and nationally, and in the case of work we contract directly, presented for bid to one or more of our pre-approved vendor partners in each of our markets. In the case of work for which we rely upon general contractors, we set prices based on the scope of work involved. By establishing and enforcing best practices and quality consistency, and through a constant process of evaluating and grading our vendor partners, we believe that we are able to reduce the costs of both materials and labor. For example, we have negotiated discounts and extended warranties for products that we regularly use during the renovation process, including appliances, HVAC systems and components, carpet and flooring, and paint, among others. We are also able to reduce general contractor fees by working directly with vendors. We believe this approach results in both a larger proportion of our upfront renovation expenditures going toward actual investment in our homes as well as lower overall expenditures than if we were to outsource all elements of vendor selection and oversight to third party general contractors.  Portfolio Optimization We maintain a sophisticated process to identify and efficiently dispose of homes that no longer fit our investment objectives. We believe we have a proven ability to optimize sales prices while reducing both time to sale and selling costs by utilizing multiple distribution channels, including bulk portfolio sales, our \u201cResident First Look\u201d program (which facilitates home sales to our current residents), direct-to-market sales, and MLS. We believe the significant local density of our portfolio, which averages approximately 5,000 homes per market as of December\u00a031, 2022, allows us to selectively sell properties without sacrificing the operating efficiency of our concentrated scale.  Environmental, Social, and Governance As one of the nation\u2019s premier home leasing companies, we have an opportunity to make a profound impact through sustainability initiatives as we seek to embody our values of Unshakeable Integrity, Genuine Care, Continuous Excellence, and Standout Citizenship. Our mission statement \u201cTogether with you, we make a house a home\u201d reflects our efforts to creating an exceptional leasing experience for our residents, a workplace where our associates can thrive, and ESG practices that contribute to a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable world.  \u202fWe believe that integrating ESG initiatives into our strategic business objectives is part of our long-term success, and we continue to evolve our corporate strategy to meet sustainability and social responsibility commitments. To that end, our in-house ESG professionals and a cross-functional task force of associates ensure consistent attention and focus is placed on ESG matters. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring, reviewing, and providing oversight with respect to our ESG strategy, initiatives, and policies via periodic updates from management regarding our ESG activities and progress. We also believe in the value of feedback, and we hold  13 13 13   ourselves accountable.\u202f We participate in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment for a third-party evaluation of our ESG performance, and we are the first United States REIT to link the pricing of a revolving credit facility to our GRESB score. In 2022, for the second year in a row, we achieved a 13% improvement in our sustainability score with GRESB. Through our integrated and ongoing approach to sustainability and corporate responsibility, we seek to drive positive change and create value for our stakeholders. Our guiding social responsibility, business, and workplace policies apply to our directors, officers, associates, and vendors. These policies apply to all activities undertaken by or on behalf of Invitation Homes anywhere we operate. Among other things, these policies encompass areas of community and associate engagement, diversity, equity, and inclusion (\u201cDE&I\u201d), human rights, corporate governance and ethics, and environmental initiatives. Environmental Stewardship We are committed to sustainability and being a good corporate citizen. We focus on environmental sustainability because we\u202frecognize that the operation of our assets, the way our associates manage and conduct our business, and the way our residents use their homes can have a meaningful impact on the environment. \u202fWhile each resident is solely responsible for utility expenses related to energy and water usage, we\u202fseek\u202fto address environmental impacts within our areas of control and encourage our residents to do the same in their homes. For information about our perspective on climate change see Part\u00a0II. Item\u00a07. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Climate Change.\u201d Social Responsibility We strive to provide a work environment that attracts, develops, and retains top talent by creating an engaging work experience with opportunities for development. Further, our engagement with residents, community members, vendors, and others helps build strong connections that benefit our communities.  Residents By offering quality homes in attractive neighborhoods, we believe we give residents the choice to lease a home in a community that may not have otherwise been attainable. We strive to provide our residents with a worry-free leasing lifestyle through service that includes welcoming them with an in-person home orientation at move-in, making their lives easier with our smart home technology and other ancillary service offerings, providing 24/7 maintenance combined with our ProCare property management platform, and surveying residents to ask for feedback that can help us make their experience even better. We have been successful at driving consistently high resident satisfaction by promoting a culture of Genuine Care, including through a formal recognition program and by linking all operational associates\u2019 compensation to resident satisfaction.  Maintaining consistent and transparent communication with our residents is a priority. In the last few years, we have updated resources on our external website to promote transparency, including:  \u2022a step-by-step guide\u202fto our application process, including\u202fdetailed qualification requirements, for potential residents;  \u2022a detailed\u202fmove-out guide\u202fto inform residents of the steps to take when moving out of one of our homes, as well as tips on how to receive their full security deposit back; and  \u2022a detailed list of lease components, such as rent, utility reimbursements, and ancillary services, to build awareness of the service selections residents have made and the charges they are responsible for when they lease a home.  We also believe it is important to listen to our residents, and we take their feedback to heart in our quest to continuously enhance the Genuine Care we provide. We survey residents at each key step in their journey with Invitation Homes, such as at move-in and move-out, and after every maintenance interaction they have with an Invitation Homes associate or vendor. We use this feedback and other information to hold ourselves accountable, with 100% of our operational associates having a portion of their compensation tied directly to resident satisfaction survey scores. We also use feedback from surveys and focus groups to help inform new service offerings and enhancements we make to the resident experience. In addition to our website and resident surveys, we engage with our residents through monthly resident newsletters, blog posts, and social media campaigns and contests.  Our all-time company rating of 4.1 on Google and Yelp combined, our A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau (\u201cBBB\u201d), and our BBB accreditation evidence our commitment to resident satisfaction.  14 14 14   Human Capital As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had 1,511 dedicated full-time associates, which we supplement with temporary and contract resources. None of our associates are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Associates are the backbone of our company. Nothing is accomplished without the day-to-day dedication of our invaluable teams. Whether they are a front-line market associate who represents us each and every day with our residents, or a centralized team member who supports the front line and strives to ensure quality and consistency of our work, our associates are our greatest asset. From our focus on associates\u2019 well-being, health, and safety to our support of a DE&I culture, we treat each other fairly and act with honesty, integrity, and respect.  We believe that diverse, equitable, and inclusive companies make for more innovative, engaged, and happy teams. Our organization celebrates diversity and cultivates a culture of equity and inclusion. As of December\u00a031, 2022, women comprise 43% of all associates and 41% of our manager and above population, and people of color comprise 47% of all associates and 30% of our manager and above population. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, 45% of our new hires were women and 55% were people of color. We currently have six active Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d): Together With Women; The Black Collective; Juntos; GenNEXT; Open Invitation; and Asian Alliance. As of December\u00a031, 2022, 427 associates were members of at least one ERG. Our DE&I philosophy contributes to our overall business strategy and serves as a catalyst for retaining our associates, recruiting diverse talent, and building beneficial business relationships with key stakeholders. This business approach is expected to help increase our workforce diversity, retain and upskill our talent, and enhance our company\u2019s culture. We expect this to position us as an employer of choice and one of the nation\u2019s leading home leasing companies. In 2022, we were recognized for our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion through several external awards: Best Company for Diversity and Best CEO for Diversity by Comparably; and Top Rated CEO for Gender Diversity and Best Company by Fairygodboss. We value feedback from our associates, and we maintain a continuous listening associate survey tool, Our Family. Your Voice. We continue to achieve high participation by our associates, with 80% of our associates sharing feedback at least once in 2022. This tool provides managers with actionable feedback on several key engagement dimensions. We believe meaningful actions based on associate feedback provided by the surveys have resulted, and will continue to result, in ongoing high engagement with our associates as evidenced by our strong associate Net Promoter Score of 60 at the end of 2022, compared to a benchmark of 33. In 2022, our focus on engagement led to recognition by Comparably for Best Company Culture, Best Company \u2014 Dallas, and Best Company Happiness. We recognize the value of providing regular development opportunities for our associates that improve their capability to succeed in their current roles and achieve career growth to meet their aspirations. In 2022, we launched Growing People for Success, a fully integrated talent cycle that incorporates our performance and feedback process, career growth and development, and leadership behaviors model. We also conduct an annual mandatory compliance training campaign and offer a robust catalog of online learning and development videos designed to help associates build their skills. We were recognized by LinkedIn in 2022 with a Top Companies in Real Estate award, ranking #8 in companies offering real estate career growth. We are committed to accelerating the development of our leaders through various programs such as \u201cLeadership Essentials,\u201d a program designed to build capable and confident leaders that can lead and inspire a diverse workforce in an ever-changing environment. In 2022, we launched an immersive six month leadership development program for 25 emerging leaders. Additionally, we designed and piloted a leadership assessment and development program, aimed at creating a science-based approach to identifying, growing, and retaining our top talent. Lastly, we brought 150 of our leaders together in 2022 to focus on leadership development, building trust, and alignment with key Invitation Homes priorities. This commitment to leadership development resulted in Invitation Homes being recognized by Comparably in 2022 as having Best Company Leadership. 15 15 15   We believe that competitive compensation and benefits are key drivers of associate attraction, retention, motivation, and engagement. Compensation is one component of our Total Value offering for Invitation Homes associates, and we strive to compensate associates fairly and consistently based on market rates for their roles, experience, and how they perform. As such, in 2022 a pay equity review was conducted by a third party consultant with oversight by our human resources team. Our results show that we have 100% pay equity in salary for women and men, and compensation received by people of color is, on average, 99% of that received by peers who are not people of color in comparable positions. We intend to continue monitoring our pay equity practices on an ongoing basis and consider pay equity dynamics when promoting internally and hiring externally. Achieving and sustaining pay equity is a key focus for us now and in the future. Another component of our Total Value offering for associates is our holistic wellness program, which is designed to enhance mental, physical, and financial wellbeing. We also offer a myFlexibility program under which many of our office-based associates have shifted to hybrid work schedules. Health and safety programs and processes are also vitally important to the wellbeing of our associates, and we conduct monthly safety training for our maintenance associates and a regular driving safety training for our fleet drivers. We continue to enhance and improve health and safety processes, and we review and monitor our performance monthly to reduce on-the-job injuries. Our goal is to reduce Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable incidents each year; however, over the past three years, our annual on-the-job injuries have increased from 40 to 48, or 20%. This increase is primarily attributable to our return to normal business operations after the COVID-19 pandemic and a 42% increase in the headcount of our operations team over the same period. We believe it is critically important to maintain a corporate culture that demands integrity and reflects ethical values. Everyone who works at or with Invitation Homes should feel confident about our high ethical standards, our honesty, and our integrity. We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the \u201cCode of Conduct\u201d) that is applicable to all of our directors, officers, and associates. The Code of Conduct helps guide us as we collaborate to accomplish our goals together, while holding ourselves individually responsible for our work and accountable for our actions. Our Vendor Code of Conduct is an extension of our values to our vendors and serves to highlight our commitment to ethical business practices and regulatory compliance. Communities We value being part of the communities where we do business, and we recognize that the vitality of our business is directly linked to the vitality of the communities in which we operate. We also believe our business has a positive economic impact on the communities in which we operate, through improved neighborhoods that benefit from our home renovations, the value of our local teams living in and contributing to the local economy, and the payment of real estate taxes and purchase of local goods and services.  We encourage our associates to be good neighbors in their respective communities by partnering with local organizations to provide support to those in need. We are actively engaged in a broad range of community and philanthropic activities in our markets, contributing funds nationwide and encouraging our associates to be active in their communities by providing each of them 20 hours of paid volunteer time each year. In 2022, associates volunteered 19,358 hours in their local communities. Governance and Ethical Business Practices We strive every day to ensure that our actions result in value for the individuals and organizations that have chosen to invest in our company, and we take that responsibility very seriously. We believe that ethical business practices and good governance promote the long-term interests of our stockholders, strengthen Board of Directors and management accountability, and improve our standing as a trusted member of the communities we serve.  We believe it is critically important to maintain a corporate culture that demands integrity and reflects our ethical values. We are committed to operating at the highest ethical level and serving as a responsible fiduciary for our stockholders. Everyone who works at or with Invitation Homes should feel confident about our high ethical standards, our honesty, and our integrity. Our daily decisions are driven by our\u202f Code of Conduct, which demonstrates our commitment to be a responsible corporate citizen and a good business partner. \u202fEach day, we work hard and are committed to delivering on our company\u2019s mission statement \u2014 \u201cTogether with you, we make a house a home.\u201d In doing so, our actions are guided by our company\u2019s core values: Unshakeable Integrity, Genuine Care, Continuous Excellence, and Standout Citizenship. The Code of Conduct helps guide us as we collaborate to accomplish our goals together, while holding ourselves individually responsible for our work and accountable for our actions.  16 16 16   Code of Conduct  Our\u202fCode of Conduct\u202fis supported by associate conduct policies and programs and reinforced through regular associate training. In our daily interactions with residents, fellow associates, vendors, suppliers, and other stakeholders, honesty and integrity are essential. These tenets are articulated in our Code of Conduct, including policies on conflicts of interest, gifts and entertainment, fraud, sanctions, outside activities, political contributions, and bribery and corruption. Any associate who violates the requirements of the Code of Conduct, or any of our other policies, is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.\u202f  Reporting Violations and Whistleblower Protection  Our confidential compliance hotline is a critical part of our ethics and compliance program. The hotline is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is operated by a third party compliance management provider, enabling automated and anonymous reporting. We have implemented a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d policy that allows our associates to file reports regarding any impropriety on a confidential and anonymous basis and establishes comprehensive procedures for the receipt, retention, investigation, and treatment of reports. The reports are reviewed with our Audit Committee at meetings throughout the year. Our Code of Conduct provides that \u201cneither our company, nor any director, officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of the company will, directly or indirectly, discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against any person who, in good faith, makes a report or assists in investigating a report.\u201d Vendor Practices  We have adopted a\u202fVendor Code of Conduct\u202fthat extends our values to company vendors and serves to highlight our commitment to ethical business practices, safe labor conditions, respect for human rights, environmental stewardship, and regulatory compliance. Risk Management We face various forms of risk in our business ranging from broad economic, housing market, and interest rate risks to more specific factors, such as credit risk related to our residents, re-leasing of properties, and competition for properties. Our Board of Directors believes that effective risk management involves our entire corporate governance framework. Both management and the Board of Directors have key responsibilities in managing risk throughout our company. Our Board of Directors provides overall risk oversight, both directly and through its committees, to help management identify and assess the major risks our company faces and to develop policies and procedures for monitoring and controlling such risks.  Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk, including identification and assessment of material risks, implementation of appropriate risk management strategies, and integration of risk management into our decision-making process. Members of the Board of Directors regularly meet with members of management and other key associates who advise the directors on areas of enterprise risk, risk mitigation, response strategies, and any incidents that have arisen. We believe that the systems and processes developed by our experienced executive team, with the strategic counsel and stewardship of our Board of Directors, allow us to effectively monitor, manage, and ultimately mitigate these risks.  We seek to maximize revenue collections through our robust, standardized resident screening process (which includes, among other things, credit checks, evaluations of household income, and criminal background checks), as well as by utilizing an online resident payment portal, which includes an auto-pay feature, to facilitate the electronic collection of a majority of our rental payments. In addition, we track resident delinquency on a daily basis and assess any late fees promptly in accordance with the terms of our lease (typically between the third and fifth calendar day of the month). See \u201c \u2014 Systems and Technology\u201d for information about cybersecurity. Insurance We maintain property, casualty, and corporate-level insurance coverage related to our business, including general liability, business auto, umbrella, commercial crime, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability, fiduciary liability, cyber liability, employment practices liability, and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits under our insurance program are appropriate and adequate for our business and properties given the relative risk of loss, the  17 17 17   cost of the coverage, and industry practice. However, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage exclusions, and we are self-insured up to the amount of such deductibles and exclusions. See Part\u00a0I. Item\u00a01A. \u201cRisk\u00a0Factors\u00a0\u2014 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry \u2014 We may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance.\u201d  Systems and Technology Effective systems and technology are essential components of our business. To ensure scalability to accommodate continued growth in our portfolio of single-family homes for lease, we have made significant investments in the lease management, construction management, property and corporate accounting, and asset management systems used to operate our business. In addition to vigilant oversight over our core platform, we are now focused on advancing cloud-based digital technologies for both our residents and our associates. Our website is fully integrated into our resident accounting and leasing system. From our website, which is accessible from mobile devices, prospective residents can browse homes available for lease, take virtual tours, request additional information, and apply to lease a specific home. To ensure we remain the first choice when leasing a home, in June 2022, we launched the industry\u2019s first branded mobile application. Prospective residents can seamlessly search for a home and schedule a tour, and existing residents can pay rent and request maintenance service all from the app. Our associates can support and manage resident requests for critical functions such as leasing and maintenance through easy-to-use digital tools. Our system is designed to handle the accounting requirements of residential property accounting, including accounting for security deposits and payment of property-level expenses. The system also interfaces with our third party resident screening vendor partner to expedite evaluations of prospective residents\u2019 rental applications. We have worked with a search engine optimization firm to ensure we place high in search engine results and will continue to monitor our placement on search engines. In addition, sponsored key words are generally purchased in selected markets as needed.  We rely on technology systems across our operations that integrate with various third party vendors for services. The failure of these systems or services to execute at subscribed levels could adversely impact our business. We proactively engage with our third party vendor about service delivery and actively use security risk management controls to mitigate any negative impact on our business. For more information on the risks related to our use of technology, see Part\u00a0I. Item\u00a01A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to our Business and Industry \u2014 Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information systems and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\u201d Cybersecurity \u2014 Using Technology to Enhance Virtual Safety  Our operations are highly dependent upon information systems that support our business processes. Cyber intrusions could seriously compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed, publicly disclosed, misused, lost, or stolen. As such, we are committed to maintaining a secure and safe technology environment. We employ a multi-layered security model that leverages risk-based controls with a focus on protecting our residents' and associates\u2019 data. We follow a cloud-first approach to enable efficient scaling, robust business continuity, access to the latest innovations, and a reduction in our carbon footprint. Security features and services are regularly enhanced to address both emerging threats and evolving privacy laws. We also partner with industry leading third parties for regular security audits. These audits ensure we are always view cybersecurity with a holistic perspective.   We maintain a cybersecurity and information security training and compliance program that includes annual information security training for all associates, as well as additional role-specific information security training. In addition to annual training, we disseminate security awareness articles periodically throughout the year and conduct regular phishing exercises. As a backstop to our strong information security programs, policies and procedures, we purchase a cybersecurity risk insurance policy that would defray the costs of an information security breach, if we were to experience one. Competition We face competition from different sources in each of our two primary activities: acquiring and leasing our properties. We believe our competitors in acquiring properties for investment purposes are individual investors, small private investment partnerships looking for one-off acquisitions of investment properties that can either be leased or restored and sold, and larger investors, including private equity funds and other REITs, that are seeking to capitalize on the same market opportunity that we have identified. Our primary competitors in acquiring portfolios include large and small private equity investors, public and private REITs, and other sizable private institutional investors. These same competitors may also compete with us for  18 18 18   residents. Competition may increase the prices for properties that we would like to purchase, reduce the amount of rent we may charge for our properties, reduce the occupancy of our portfolio, and adversely impact our ability to achieve attractive total returns. However, we believe that our acquisition platform, our extensive in-market property operations infrastructure, and local expertise in our markets provide us with competitive advantages. Inflation  Inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of increased repair and maintenance and other costs and wage pressures. Inflation could also impact our cost of capital as a result of changing interest rates on variable rate debt that is not hedged or if our debt instruments are refinanced in a high-inflation environment. Our resident leases typically have a term of one to two years, which generally enables us to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing rents on our homes to current market rates. Although an extreme or sustained escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this had a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022. Seasonality  Our business and related operating results have been, and we believe will continue to be, impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year. In particular, we have experienced higher levels of resident move-outs during the summer months, which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs. Further, our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as HVAC repairs and costs to re-resident during the summer season.  Regulation General Our business operations and properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances, and rules. We believe that we are in material compliance with such covenants, laws, ordinances, and rules, and we also require that our residents agree to comply with such covenants, laws, ordinances, and rules in their leases with us.  Fair Housing Act The Fair Housing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d) and its state law counterparts, and the regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and various state agencies, prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (including children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians, pregnant women, and people in the process of adopting a child or securing custody of children under the age of 18), disability or, in some states, financial capability. We train our associates on a regular basis regarding such laws and regulations and we believe that our properties are in compliance with the FHA and other such regulations.  Municipal Regulations and Homeowners\u2019 Associations Our properties are subject to various municipal regulations and orders, and county and city ordinances, including without limitation, use, operation and maintenance of our properties. Certain of our properties are subject to the rules of the various HOAs where such properties are located. HOA rules and regulations are commonly referred to as \u201ccovenants, conditions and restrictions,\u201d or CC&Rs, and typically consist of various restrictions or guidelines regarding use and maintenance of the property, including, among others, noise restrictions or guidelines as to how many cars may be parked on the property.  Broker Licensure We own internal brokerages to serve each state in which we operate and utilize in-market leasing experience specialists to drive an end-to-end resident experience that achieves our occupancy, revenue, and retention goals while facilitating enjoyment of a worry-free leasing lifestyle. Our internal brokerages are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations that govern the licensure of real estate brokers and affiliate brokers and set forth standards for, and prohibitions on, the conduct of real estate brokers. Such standards and prohibitions include, among others, those relating to fiduciary and agency duties, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, and advertising and consumer disclosures, as well as  19 19 19   compliance with federal, state, and local laws and programs for providing housing to low-income families. Under applicable state law, we generally have a duty to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of our internal brokerages.  Environmental Matters As a current or prior owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and ordinances, and we could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties, even if we no longer own such properties. We are not aware of any environmental matters that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position. See Part\u00a0I. Item\u00a01A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry \u2014 Contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.\u201d Laws and Regulations Regarding Privacy and Data Protection We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve matters such as privacy, data protection, content, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Nevada Privacy Law, which took effect in January\u00a02020, establish certain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users, including more ability to control how their data is shared with third parties. See Part\u00a0I. Item\u00a01A. \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry \u2014 Our business is subject to laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, and other matters.\u201d Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, or other harm to our business and results of operations. Segment Reporting  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.  Under the provisions of ASC\u00a0280, Segment Reporting, we have determined that we have one reportable segment related to acquiring, renovating, leasing, and operating single-family homes as rental properties. The CODM evaluates operating performance and allocates resources on a total portfolio basis. The CODM utilizes net operating income (\u201cNOI\u201d) as the primary measure to evaluate performance of the total portfolio.  REIT Qualification We have elected to qualify as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes. So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax on net taxable income that we distribute annually to our stockholders. To qualify as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders, and the diversity of ownership of our stock. To comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations. Website and Availability of SEC filings We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. Our SEC filings are available to the public over the Internet at the SEC\u2019s website at https://www.sec.gov.  We maintain an internet site at INVH.com, where we make our annual reports on Form\u00a010-K, quarterly reports on Form\u00a010-Q, current reports on Form\u00a08-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section\u00a013(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our website and the information contained on or through that site are not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K. We use our website INVH.com as a channel of distribution of material company information. For example, financial and other material information regarding our company is routinely posted on and accessible at INVH.com. Accordingly, investors should monitor the website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, and public  20 20 20   conference calls and webcasts.
