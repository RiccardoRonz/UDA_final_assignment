Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably. With our employees focused on safe and reliable operations, environmental stewardship, and disciplined capital and corporate management, we are on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network \u2013 the world\u2019s largest \u2013 to enable green and blue hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement and other industrial activities. Our nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, an extensive storage, transportation and distribution network in North America, and logistics capabilities enabling a global reach underpin our strategy to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to clean energy. Our principal customers are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, wholesalers and industrial users. Our core product is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which contains 82% nitrogen and 18% hydrogen. Our nitrogen products that are upgraded from ammonia are granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) and ammonium nitrate (AN). Our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers.  Our principal assets as of December 31, 2022 include: \u2022five U.S. nitrogen manufacturing facilities, located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest nitrogen complex in the world); Sergeant Bluff, Iowa (our Port Neal complex); Yazoo City, Mississippi; Claremore, Oklahoma (our Verdigris complex); and Woodward, Oklahoma. These facilities are wholly owned directly or indirectly by CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN), of which we own approximately 89% and CHS Inc. (CHS) owns the remainder; \u2022two Canadian nitrogen manufacturing facilities, located in Medicine Hat, Alberta (the largest nitrogen complex in Canada) and Courtright, Ontario;  \u2022a United Kingdom nitrogen manufacturing facility located in Billingham; \u2022an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States; and \u2022a 50% interest in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited (PLNL), an ammonia production joint venture located in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad) that we account for under the equity method. We have a strategic venture with CHS under which CHS owns an equity interest in CFN, a subsidiary of CF Holdings, which represents approximately 11% of the membership interests of CFN. We own the remaining membership interests. CHS also receives deliveries pursuant to a supply agreement under which CHS has the right to purchase annually from CFN up to approximately 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of UAN at market prices. As a result of its minority equity interest in CFN, CHS is entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. We are also entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. See Note\u00a017\u2014Noncontrolling Interest for additional information on our strategic venture with CHS. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we sold 18.3 million, 18.5 million and 20.3 million product tons generating net sales of $11.19 billion, $6.54 billion and $4.12 billion, respectively.

The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our Commitment to a Clean Energy Economy We are taking significant steps to support a global hydrogen and clean fuel economy, through the production of green and blue ammonia. Since ammonia is one of the most efficient ways to transport and store hydrogen and is also a fuel in its own right, we believe that the Company, as the world\u2019s largest producer of ammonia, with an unparalleled manufacturing and distribution network and deep technical expertise, is uniquely positioned to fulfill anticipated demand for hydrogen and ammonia from green and blue sources. Our approach includes green ammonia production, which refers to ammonia produced through a carbon-free process, and blue ammonia production, which relates to ammonia produced by conventional processes but with CO2 byproduct removed through carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).  In April 2021, we signed an engineering and procurement contract with thyssenkrupp to supply a 20 MW alkaline water electrolysis plant to produce green hydrogen at our Donaldsonville complex. Construction and installation, which is being managed by us, is expected to finish in 2023, with an estimated total cost of approximately $100 million. We will integrate the green hydrogen generated by the electrolysis plant into existing ammonia synthesis loops to enable the production of approximately 20,000 tons per year of green ammonia. We believe that the Donaldsonville green ammonia project will be the largest of its kind in North America.  In July 2022, we and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (Mitsui) signed a joint development agreement for the companies\u2019 proposed plans to construct an export-oriented blue ammonia facility. We and Mitsui continue to progress a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study for the project, and expect to make a final investment decision on the proposed facility in the second half of 2023. Should the companies agree to move forward, the ammonia facility would be constructed at our new Blue Point complex. We acquired the land on the west bank of the Mississippi river in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, for the complex during the third quarter of 2022. Construction and commissioning of a new world-scale ammonia plant typically takes approximately four years from the time construction begins.  We are also exploring opportunities to produce blue ammonia from our existing ammonia production network. We have announced a project with an estimated cost of $200 million to construct a CO2 dehydration and compression facility at our Donaldsonville complex to enable the transport and permanent sequestration of the ammonia process CO2 byproduct. Engineering activities and procurement of major equipment for the facility are in progress, and modification of the site\u2019s existing equipment to allow integration with existing operations has begun. Once the dehydration and compression unit is in service and sequestration is initiated, we expect that the Donaldsonville complex will have the capacity to dehydrate and compress up to 2 million tons per year of CO2, enabling the production of blue ammonia. In October 2022, we announced that we had entered into a definitive CO2 offtake agreement with ExxonMobil to transport and permanently sequester the CO2 from Donaldsonville. Start-up for the project is scheduled for early 2025. Under current regulations, the project would be expected to qualify for tax credits under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides a credit per tonne of CO2 sequestered. Company History We were founded in 1946 as Central Farmers Fertilizer Company, and were owned by a group of regional agriculture cooperatives for the first 59 years of our existence. Central Farmers became CF Industries in 1970.  Originally established as a fertilizer brokerage company, we expanded owning and operating fertilizer manufacturing and distribution facilities in the early 1950s with a principal objective of assured supply for our owners. At various times in our history, we manufactured and/or distributed nitrogen, phosphate and potash fertilizers. We operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002, when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective, rather than assured supply for our owners. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace. In August 2005, we completed the initial public offering (IPO) of our common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our pre-IPO owners\u2019 equity interests in CF Industries were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock. At the time of the IPO, our assets consisted of one wholly owned nitrogen manufacturing facility in Louisiana, United States; a joint venture nitrogen manufacturing facility in Alberta, Canada, of which we owned 66 percent; a phosphate mining and manufacturing operation in Florida, United States; and distribution facilities throughout North America. 2 2 2 Table of ContentsCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.   In April 2010, we acquired Terra Industries\u00a0Inc. (Terra), a leading North American producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of $4.6\u00a0billion, which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock. As a result of the Terra acquisition, we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities; an approximately 75.3% interest in Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP), a publicly traded limited partnership; and certain joint venture interests.  Prior to April 30, 2013, CF Industries owned 66 percent of Canadian Fertilizers Limited (CFL), a joint venture nitrogen manufacturing facility in Alberta, Canada. On April 30, 2013, CF Industries acquired all of the outstanding interests in CFL that it did not already own and CFL became our wholly owned subsidiary. In March 2014, we exited our phosphate mining and manufacturing business, which was located in Florida, through a sale to The Mosaic Company. As a result, we became focused solely on nitrogen manufacturing and distribution. In July 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK Group Limited (formerly known as GrowHow UK Group Limited) (CF Fertilisers UK) not previously owned by us, and CF Fertilisers UK became wholly owned by us. This transaction added CF Fertilisers UK\u2019s nitrogen manufacturing complexes to our consolidated manufacturing capacity.   In February 2016, our strategic venture with CHS commenced, at which time CHS made a capital contribution of $2.8\u00a0billion to CFN in exchange for membership interests in CFN, which represented approximately 11% of the total membership interests of CFN. In late 2015 and 2016, we completed capacity expansion projects at our Donaldsonville complex in Louisiana and our Port Neal complex in Iowa. These projects, originally announced in 2012, included the construction of new ammonia, urea, and UAN plants at our Donaldsonville complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal complex. These plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25%, improved our product mix flexibility at Donaldsonville, and improved our ability to serve upper-Midwest urea customers from our Port Neal location. The total capital cost of the capacity expansion projects was $5.2 billion. Prior to April 2, 2018, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership, which owns and operates our Verdigris nitrogen manufacturing facility in Oklahoma, was a subsidiary of TNCLP. On April 2, 2018, Terra Nitrogen GP Inc., the sole general partner of TNCLP and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, completed its purchase of all of the publicly traded common units of TNCLP (the Purchase). Upon completion of the Purchase, CF Holdings owned, through its subsidiaries, 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP.

Our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs: Henry Hub, SONAT and TETCO ELA in Louisiana; ONEOK in Oklahoma; AECO in Alberta; Ventura in Iowa; Demarcation in Kansas; Welcome in Minnesota; Dawn and Parkway in Ontario; and the National Balancing Point (NBP) in the United Kingdom. In 2022, our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consumed, in the aggregate, approximately 330\u00a0million MMBtus of natural gas. We employ a combination of daily spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable, competitively-priced supply of natural gas. We also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices. See Note\u00a015\u2014Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information about our natural gas hedging activities. Nitrogen Product Distribution The safe, efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen products is critical for successful operations. Our nitrogen production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship products to terminals, warehouses and customers. Each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location. Our North American nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and to our storage facilities in the U.S. and Canada, with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5,000 tank and hopper cars, as well as railcars provided by rail carriers. Our United Kingdom nitrogen production facility mainly ships products via truck.  The North American waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our Donaldsonville, Verdigris and Yazoo City facilities. To ship ammonia and UAN, we employ a fleet of up to eleven tow boats and thirty-six river barges, which are primarily leased. We also utilize contract marine services to move granular urea and AN. We can also export nitrogen products via seagoing vessels from our Donaldsonville and Billingham manufacturing facilities. The Donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2,000-mile long Nustar pipeline through which we have the ability to transport ammonia to ten terminals and shipping points in the Midwestern U.S. corn belt. 6 6 6 Table of ContentsCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force. CHS was our largest customer in 2022 and accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated net sales. We have a strategic venture with CHS under which CHS has a minority equity interest in CFN. See Note\u00a017\u2014Noncontrolling Interest for additional information on our strategic venture with CHS.  Competition Our markets are global and intensely competitive, based primarily on delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. During the peak demand periods, product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers.  Our primary North American-based competitors include Nutrien Ltd., Koch Fertilizer LLC, N-7 LLC (a joint venture between OCI N.V. and Dakota Gasification Company) and Yara International. There is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world, including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs, which may include the benefit of government subsidies. Because ammonia, urea and UAN are widely-traded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry, we experience competition from foreign-sourced products continuously. Producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers located in the Middle East, Trinidad, North Africa and Russia have been major exporters to North America in recent years. Our primary United Kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including Yara International, Origin Fertilisers, Ameropa and Thomas Bell & Sons Ltd. Urea and UAN are not produced in the United Kingdom, but along with AN are widely-traded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry.  Seasonality The fertilizer business is seasonal. The degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors. The strongest demand for our products in North America occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. In contrast, we and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year. As a result, we and/or our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to  7 7 7 Table of ContentsCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.   the next due to weather-related shifts in planting and application schedules and purchasing patterns as well as import timing, import and distribution costs and logistical limitations, such as river conditions. Environmental, Health and Safety We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union (EU) and Trinidad, including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; the introduction of new chemicals or substances into a market; the cleanup of hazardous substance releases; the discharge of regulated substances to air or water; and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure. In the United States, these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and various other federal, state and local statutes. Violations of environmental, health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment. We may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental, health and safety laws in the future. Environmental, Health and Safety Expenditures  Our environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2022 totaled approximately $31\u00a0million. We estimate that we will have approximately $57\u00a0million of environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2023. In addition, to support safe and reliable operations at our continuous process manufacturing facilities, we conduct scheduled inspections, replacements and overhauls of our plant machinery and equipment, which are referred to as turnarounds. A further description of turnaround activities is included in Note 6\u2014Property, Plant and Equipment\u2014Net in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our manufacturing and distribution facilities. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures. Our costs to comply with, or any liabilities under, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. CERCLA/Remediation Matters  From time to time, we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup laws. In 2011, we received a notice from the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine site we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho. The current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site. In 2014, we and the current property owner entered into a Consent Order with IDEQ and the U.S. Forest Service to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the site. The remedial investigation was submitted to the agencies in 2021. The next step will be a risk assessment, followed by a feasibility study. In 2015, we and several other parties received a notice that the U.S. Department of the Interior and other trustees intended to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for 18 former phosphate mines and three former processing facilities in southeast Idaho, which includes the Georgetown Canyon former mine and processing facility. See Note\u00a020\u2014Contingencies for additional information. Regulation of Greenhouse Gases  Our production facilities emit greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process. We are subject to GHG regulations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. Our U.K. manufacturing plant is required to report GHG emissions annually to the United Kingdom Environment Agency pursuant to its site Environmental Permits and Climate Change Agreement, which specifies energy efficiency targets. Failure to meet efficiency targets may require the plant to purchase CO2 emissions allowances. Our U.K. manufacturing plant is subject to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which generally requires us to hold or obtain emission allowances to offset GHG emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program. 8 8 8 Table of ContentsCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.   In Canada, we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with Environment Canada\u2019s National Pollutant Release Inventory, Ontario\u2019s Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Regulation, and the GHG Reporting Regulation. In addition, our manufacturing plants in Alberta and Ontario are subject to provincial or federal laws that impose a price on excess GHG emissions. Each of these laws establishes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions standards applicable to our facilities in terms of emissions per unit of production, with the provincial laws and the federal law using different formulas for establishing the intensity-based limits and the reductions in these limits over time. The federal law is the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, which came into effect in 2018 and is intended to function only as a backstop to the provincial programs if such programs do not meet minimum federal criteria. In 2022, the federal government found that both the Alberta and Ontario programs for 2023-2030 met such minimum criteria, and therefore, the provincial laws apply. Effective January 1, 2023, these provincial regulations will increase in stringency from 2022 levels. If a facility\u2019s CO2e emissions exceed the applicable limit, the excess emissions must be offset, either through obtaining qualifying emission credits or by making a payment for each ton of excess emissions. For calendar year 2023, the excess emissions fee under the federal, Alberta and Ontario regulatory programs is CAD $65 per tonne, which fee will increase by CAD $15 per tonne per year, reaching CAD $170 per tonne by 2030. In the United States, GHG regulation is evolving at state, regional and federal levels, although some of the more significant developments to date, including efforts of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, do not directly impose obligations on our facilities. The EPA issued a mandatory GHG reporting rule that required all of our U.S. manufacturing facilities, which are considered large emitters of GHGs, to commence monitoring GHG emissions beginning on January\u00a01, 2010 and reporting the previous year\u2019s emissions annually starting in 2011. In addition, if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result, are required to obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) construction permit applicable to such facilities, we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to GHGs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants. Such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects. Other than the states\u2019 implementation of this permitting requirement, none of the states where our U.S. production facilities are located \u2013 Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma \u2013 has proposed control regulations limiting GHG emissions. Increasing concern over the impacts of climate change is driving countries to establish ever more ambitious GHG reduction targets. Approximately 200 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the members of the EU have joined the Paris Agreement, an international agreement intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Each signatory is required to develop its own national plan to attain this objective. In December 2020, the United Kingdom announced a target to reduce GHG emissions 68% from the baseline year of 1990 by 2030. Canada has increased its emissions reduction target under the Paris Agreement to 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2030, up from 30%. In April 2021, the United States increased its goal to reduce GHG emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Executive orders issued by the Biden administration, including in particular an executive order issued on January 27, 2021 focusing on climate change, evidence the administration\u2019s intent to undertake numerous initiatives in an effort to reduce GHG emissions, including promoting renewable energy development, limiting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and, in general, making climate change considerations a critical component of federal policy.  Regulatory Permits and Approvals We hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. More stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits.  Human Capital Resources Our long-term success depends on our people. We are dedicated to creating a workplace where employees are proud to work and grow and where everyone feels empowered to do their best work. We do this by investing in extensive recruitment, training and professional development opportunities for our employees and fostering diversity and inclusion in our culture.   Employee Population.  We employed approximately 2,700 employees at December 31, 2022, of which 76% were located in the United States, 15% in Canada, and 9% in the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2022, 12% of our employees have worked for the Company more than 20 years, 18% of our employees have worked for the Company between 11 and 20 years, 28% of our employees have worked for the Company between 6 and 10 years, and 42% of our employees have worked at the  9 9 9 Table of ContentsCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.   Company for less than 6 years. Full-time employees represented nearly 100% of our workforce as of December 31, 2022 and approximately 6% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We supplement our workforce with contractors with specialized skill sets during periods of peak activity, such as during turnarounds and maintenance events. Culture, Inclusion and Diversity. Our core values and their underlying principles reflect our commitment to a diverse and inclusive culture, treating one another with respect. Across the Company, all employees completed training to learn to recognize and address the effects of unconscious bias by challenging assumptions; encouraging diversity of experience, opinion, and expression; and supporting a workplace culture that actively strives to be more inclusive. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 15% of our global workforce was female and 17% of the Company\u2019s employees in frontline managerial roles were female. Minorities represented approximately 17% of the Company\u2019s U.S. workforce and 15% of our U.S. employees in managerial roles. In order to continue to improve the inclusiveness and diversity of our company and culture, our comprehensive ESG goals announced in 2020 include goals to increase the representation of females and persons of color in senior leadership roles and to implement a program designed to increase the hiring and promotion of minority and female candidates. As of December 31, 2022, we had exceeded our representation goal with approximately 38% of senior leadership roles held by females and persons of color. Workforce Health and Safety. Operating in a safe and responsible manner is a core value and an integral part of what sets the Company apart. We believe that focusing on leading indicators - such as the behavioral safety practices we have incorporated into our annual incentive plan \u2014 to drive and measure activities that prevent safety incidents, results in our industry-leading safety record. As of December 31, 2022, our employee 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate (RIR) was 0.33 incidents per 200,000 work hours, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, our total recordable injury count was nine. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our days away, restricted or transferred (DART) incident rate was 0.22 injuries per 200,000 work hours, and our lost time incident rate was 0.04 injuries per 200,000 work hours.   Talent Development.  A core aspect of our culture is our commitment to identifying and developing talent to help employees accelerate growth and achieve their career goals. We invest in extensive assessment, training and professional development opportunities for our employees through a robust set of formal and informal programs, including targeted job movements, key experiences, and training, with an emphasis on creating a culture of inclusion. Leadership is the quality that drives our values and sets us apart. To help foster leadership, we have developed a set of leadership competencies that provide a common language for how to demonstrate leadership at every level of the organization and have embedded them into all talent management processes, including selection, performance management and succession planning. We view training and development programs as being a key part of talent management, allowing us to grow a stronger company today and in the future. 10 10 10  Table of ContentsCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
