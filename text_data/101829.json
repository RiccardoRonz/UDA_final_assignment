Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts). Total backlog was $175 billion and $156 billion as of December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of the total RPO as of December\u00a031, 2022, we expect approximately 25% will be recognized as sales over the next 12 months. Competition All of our businesses are subject to significant competition. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, delivery schedule, past performance, reliability, customer service, product development, innovation and technology. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. Further, some non-U.S. competitors receive government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products beyond the assistance that may be available to us as a U.S. company. In addition, the competitive landscape in the industry segments we serve continues to evolve with trends such as increased vertical integration by competitors and customers and the emergence of more commercial competitors on defense development programs.  Our aerospace businesses compete with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers, customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. government\u2019s and other governments\u2019 policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Some competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products. Our defense businesses compete with numerous U.S. and foreign companies in most defense and government electronics, space, information technology and technical services and support segments. We frequently partner on defense programs with our major suppliers, some of whom are, from time to time, competitors on other programs.  People As a global technology and innovation-driven company, we depend on a highly skilled workforce. Attracting, developing, advancing and retaining the best talent is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our business. Individuals with technical, engineering, and science backgrounds, experience, or interests are particularly important for us to succeed in the industries in which we compete.  Due to macroeconomic, industry and labor market conditions, we have experienced and continue to experience a highly competitive environment with respect to hiring and retaining employees with relevant qualifications and experience, particularly personnel with specialized engineering experience and security clearances, which has negatively impacted our operating and financial performance. We continuously monitor labor market conditions and trends and are working to mitigate this issue through talent acquisition, partnership, sourcing and recruiting arrangements, workforce succession planning, talent identification, development and advancement, engagement and recognition programs, and initiatives to attract and rehire former  7 7 7  Table of Contents Table of Contents employees. However, we expect the current labor market conditions and highly competitive employee hiring and retention environment to continue. Governance. The Human Capital & Compensation Committee of the RTC Board of Directors oversees the Company\u2019s human capital management.  Workforce Demographics. As of December\u00a031, 2022, our global employee population consisted of a total of approximately 182,000 employees, including approximately 55,000 engineering professionals and approximately 31,000 employees represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies. Our employees are located in 52 countries, with 70% of our employees located in the U.S.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I). We strive to advance a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment. We believe a work environment where all individuals are respected, valued and supported enables them to focus on developing the most innovative solutions to our industry\u2019s greatest challenges. We have a DE&I advisory board of senior leaders. We review diversity in talent development and promotion, employee compensation practices and succession planning, and embed DE&I training into our leadership development programs. We have published our U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity EEO-1 report data as part of our Environmental Social Governance Report. We have nine diverse global employee resource groups, which are volunteer-run organizations that are open to all employees and are intended to foster an inclusive culture. We also invest in a more diverse workforce by supporting science, technology, engineering and mathematics initiatives for women and people of color, and providing opportunities and support to military veterans, people with disabilities and the LGBTQ+ community. As of December\u00a031, 2022, women represented 25% of our global workforce and 33% of our global executives, and people of color represented 32% of our U.S. employee population and 17% of our U.S. executives. In addition, based on those employees who self-identified, veterans represented 12% of our U.S. employee population. Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention; Employee Health and Safety. We continuously monitor the hiring, retention and management of our employees by business and function with a focus to attract, develop, engage, advance and retain the best talent in the industry. We invest in our workforce through internal and external education, training and development programs and tuition assistance benefits. We also provide market competitive compensation and benefits. We recognize and reward performance during our annual review process. We regularly conduct succession planning to ensure that we continue to cultivate the leadership pipeline of talent needed to execute our business strategy. We solicit employee feedback on RTC\u2019s performance as an employer via confidential surveys in the pre-hire, active and exit stages of employment, and use those results to improve our workplace and employee experience. These surveys cover various topics related to employee engagement and satisfaction.  We have industry-leading health and safety programs to help maintain a safe work environment for all employees and mitigate workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We review and monitor our performance and encourage employee input to identify opportunities to reduce incidents. Moreover, we have industry-leading ethics and compliance programs to help mitigate associated employee risks. We also provide health and wellness benefits and support flexible work arrangements for our employees. Additional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our \u201cPeople\u201d section of our Environmental Social Governance Report that can be found on our company website. Information on our website, including our Environmental Social Governance Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.  For information on the risks related to our human capital resources, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K. Research and Development and Operations Our innovative products and services incorporate advanced technologies. As a result, we invest substantial amounts in research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds and under contractual arrangements with our customers, to enhance existing products and services and develop future technologies to meet our customers\u2019 changing needs and requirements, as well as to address new business opportunities.  We manufacture and service our products in over 229 manufacturing, production or overhaul facilities in approximately 30 countries, including the U.S. In addition, RTC has offices in approximately 10 other countries. Intellectual Property We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. We rely on a combination of these rights, along with nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses to certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in the performance of government contracts. Commercial customers also have licenses to certain of our intellectual property largely in connection  8 8 8  Table of Contents Table of Contents with the sale of our products. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Suppliers and Raw Materials We are dependent upon the availability of materials and major components and the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors. Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. In addition, in some cases, we must comply with specific procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium, nickel and titanium. We also have some foreign suppliers as single-source suppliers of components. Global supply chain and labor markets are continuing to experience high levels of disruption, causing significant materials and parts shortages, including raw material, microelectronics and commodity shortages, as well as delivery delays, labor shortages, distribution issues, energy cost increases and price increases. We and many of our suppliers and subcontractors have ceased operations in Russia due to sanctions and have ceased sourcing of components that are subject to sanctions. Other suppliers and subcontractors are located in areas experiencing supply impediments or are at risk of being subjected to trade restrictive actions, due to current geopolitical conditions. In addition, some suppliers and subcontractors have been, or may in the future be, impacted by credit market conditions, including higher interest rates and the availability of credit. Our supplier and subcontractor performance continues to be affected by these issues, and we have experienced difficulties receiving necessary raw materials, components, other supplies and third-party services on a timely basis or at all. Our business has been negatively impacted by the above factors, as well as price increases arising from these issues and ongoing inflation. We work continuously to mitigate the effects of these supply chain issues through targeted activities as well as through our ongoing supply chain programs. We work with our suppliers and subcontractors to assess the causes of performance failures and delays. We are providing our suppliers with access to our contract labor networks to augment supplier workforces, providing suppliers with raw materials and technical support, and leveraging our raw materials contracts to apply our negotiated rates to purchases by our suppliers. We are also working to arrange second and third supply source alternatives and have increased our inventory of available materials and parts. We regularly pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating or re-sourcing our purchased parts, expanding use of long-term agreements, reducing the number of suppliers generally (except as described above for important supply alternatives), strategic sourcing in cost competitive regions, competitions among suppliers and other low-cost sourcing initiatives. We also have a number of ongoing programs to manage our dependence on foreign raw material supply and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. In addition, to help address the risk of supplier closings or bankruptcies, we monitor the liquidity of our significant supplier base. For additional information related to supply chain issues, see Item IA. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K. Other Matters Relating to Our Business As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section, in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d in Item 1. \u201cCautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,\u201d and in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, the labor market, supply chains, inflation, and the industries in which we operate. Commercial air travel has been significantly disrupted by the pandemic and government, business and individual actions in response. Commercial air travel has not fully returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, although we continue to see signs of ongoing recovery. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic capacity will fully return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. For additional information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the DoD, the FAA, and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business. U.S. Government Contracts. As previously discussed, the U.S. government is our largest customer, representing a substantial majority of our total defense sales. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for  9 9 9  Table of Contents Table of Contents convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Our U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government; department-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the DoD\u2019s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. A contractor\u2019s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments, forfeiture of profits, and/or the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines, and could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, including on-going litigation associated with U.S. government audits and investigations, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Form 10-K and \u201cNote\u00a018: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Commercial Aerospace Product Regulation. Our commercial aerospace products are subject to regulations by the FAA, foreign aviation administration authorities and international regulatory bodies, including on production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. In addition, commercial aerospace regulations and regulator approaches differ across jurisdictions and changes in such regulations and implementing legislation can impact our operations. Environmental Regulation. Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to the generation, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in some of our operations and have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs associated with environmental compliance activities and management of remediation matters at sites with pollutants. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, or state law counterparts to the Superfund law, for a number of sites. The nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. We also manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government, and we have relied upon the U.S. government funding to pay such costs. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Environmental matters are further addressed in \u201cNote\u00a01: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles\u201d and \u201cNote\u00a018: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected.  In addition, we could be affected by future foreign or domestic laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, and we monitor developments in environmental and climate-related laws and regulations and their potential impact to our business and financial condition. Changes in environmental and climate-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, energy taxes, product efficiency standards, and mandatory disclosure obligations could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. For further discussion of risks related to environmental and climate matters and other government regulations, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K. Other Applicable Regulations. We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. As a result, our businesses and operations are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. government laws, regulations and procurement policies and  10 10 10  Table of Contents Table of Contents practices, including regulations relating to import-export controls, tariffs, taxes, investment, sanctions, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and cash repatriation. Our international sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.
