{"cik": 37996, "item_1A": "ITEM 1. Business.  Ford Motor Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1919.  We acquired the business of a Michigan company, also known as Ford Motor Company, which had been incorporated in 1903 to produce and sell automobiles designed and engineered by Henry Ford.  We are a global company based in Dearborn, Michigan.  With about 173,000 employees worldwide, the Company is committed to helping build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams.  The Company\u2019s Ford+ plan for growth and value creation combines existing strengths, new capabilities, and always-on relationships with customers to enrich experiences for customers and deepen their loyalty.  Ford develops and delivers innovative, must-have Ford trucks, sport utility vehicles, commercial vans and cars, and Lincoln luxury vehicles, along with connected services.  With our change in segments effective January 1, 2023, the Company does that through three customer-centered business segments:  Ford Blue, engineering iconic gas-powered and hybrid vehicles;  Ford Model e, inventing breakthrough electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d) along with embedded software that defines always-on digital experiences for all customers; and Ford Pro, helping commercial customers transform and expand their businesses with  vehicles and services tailored to their needs.  Additionally, the Company is pursuing mobility solutions through Ford Next (previously Mobility) and provides financial services through Ford Motor Credit Company LLC (\u201cFord Credit\u201d).

Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  OVERVIEW  On January 1, 2023, we implemented a new operating model and reporting structure.  With this change, we will analyze the results of our business through the following reportable segments:  Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro (combined, replacing the Automotive segment); Ford Next (previously Mobility); and Ford Credit.  As a result of the change, beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2023, we will report our results in these five reportable segments.  Company adjusted EBIT will include the financial results of these five reportable segments and Corporate Other, and net income will comprise the financial results of the five reportable segments and Corporate Other, as well as Interest on Debt, Special Items, and Taxes.  Below is a description of our reportable segments and other activities as of December 31, 2022.     AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT  The Automotive segment primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles, service parts, and accessories worldwide, together with the associated costs to develop, manufacture, distribute, and service the vehicles, parts, and accessories.  This segment includes revenues and costs related to our electrification vehicle programs and enterprise connectivity.  The segment includes the following regional business units:  North America, South America, Europe, China (including Taiwan), and the International Markets Group.    General  Our vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln.\u00a0\u00a0In 2022, we sold approximately 4,231,000\u00a0vehicles at wholesale throughout the world.  See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (\u201cItem\u00a07\u201d) for a discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes.  Substantially all of our vehicles, parts, and accessories are sold through distributors and dealers (collectively, \u201cdealerships\u201d), the substantial majority of which are independently owned.\u00a0\u00a0At December 31, the approximate number of dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows: Brand20212022Ford8,900\u00a08,596\u00a0Ford-Lincoln (combined)654\u00a0607\u00a0Lincoln401\u00a0408\u00a0Total9,955\u00a09,611\u00a0  We do not depend on any single customer or a few customers to the extent that the loss of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.   In addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale, we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to fleet customers, including commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments.\u00a0\u00a0We also sell parts and accessories, primarily to our dealerships (which, in turn, sell these products to retail customers) and to authorized parts distributors (which, in turn, primarily sell these products to retailers).  We also offer extended service contracts.   The worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic and political conditions over which we have little control.\u00a0\u00a0Vehicles are durable goods, and consumers and businesses have latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth, geopolitical events, and other factors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars, trucks, and utility vehicles and the availability and cost of financing and fuel).\u00a0\u00a0As a result, the number of cars, trucks, and utility vehicles sold may vary substantially from year to year.\u00a0\u00a0Further, the automotive industry is a highly competitive business that has a wide and growing variety of product and service offerings from a growing number of manufacturers. 2 2 2 Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Our wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand.  Our wholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory, and our ability to maintain sufficient production levels to support desired dealer inventory in the event of supplier disruptions or other types of disruptions affecting our production.  Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived by customers in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety, fuel efficiency, functionality, and reputation.\u00a0\u00a0Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions.\u00a0\u00a0Our ability to satisfy changing consumer and business preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance characteristics, affects our sales and earnings significantly.  As with other manufacturers, the profitability of our business is affected by many factors, including:  \u2022Wholesale unit volumes \u2022Margin of profit on each vehicle sold - which, in turn, is affected by many factors, such as: \u25e6Market factors - volume and mix of vehicles and options sold, and net pricing (reflecting, among other factors, incentive programs)   \u25e6Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles \u25e6Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions \u25e6Costs for safety, emissions, and fuel economy technology and equipment \u2022A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly affect overall profitability  Although recent supply disruptions have resulted in near-term upward pressure on new vehicle prices, our industry has historically had a very competitive pricing environment, driven in part by excess capacity.  For the past several decades, manufacturers typically have offered price discounts and other marketing incentives to provide value for customers and maintain market share and production levels, and we are beginning to see indications that some of these actions will resume in 2023 as industry production and inventories improve.\u00a0\u00a0The decline in value of foreign currencies in the past has also contributed significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets.\u00a0   Competitive Position.\u00a0\u00a0The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single dominant producer.  Certain manufacturers, however, account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries, especially their countries of origin.\u00a0\u00a0  Seasonality.\u00a0\u00a0We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors, including retail sales (i.e.,\u00a0units sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail) and dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in inventory by our dealerships for sale to their customers).  Historically, we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business, with production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer (typically the strongest sales months of the year).  In recent years, due to COVID-19, the semiconductor shortage, and other supply constraints, production has been higher in the second half of the year.  Backlog Orders.\u00a0\u00a0During the past year, gross stock levels at dealers were lower than normal due largely to the semiconductor shortage and other supply constraints, and the amount of time required to fill orders for certain vehicles increased.    Raw Materials.\u00a0\u00a0We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in the production of, and development of technologies in, our vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0These materials include base metals (e.g., steel and aluminum), precious metals (e.g.,\u00a0palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas), and plastics/resins (e.g.,\u00a0polypropylene).\u00a0\u00a0As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries.  We expect to have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs; however, there always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact availability in sufficient quantities and at cost effective prices to meet our needs.\u00a0\u00a0See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the risks associated with a shortage of components or raw materials, supplier disruptions, and inflationary pressures, the \u201cKey Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry\u201d section of Item\u00a07 for a discussion of supplier disruptions caused by a shortage of key components, as well as commodity and energy price changes, and \u201cItem\u00a07A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d (\u201cItem 7A\u201d) for a discussion of commodity price risks.   3 3 3 Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Intellectual Property.\u00a0\u00a0We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks on a global basis.\u00a0 We expect to continue building this portfolio as we actively pursue innovation in every part of our business.\u00a0 We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its products and services globally.\u00a0 While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property agreement.  Warranty Coverage, Field Service Actions, and Customer Satisfaction Actions.\u00a0\u00a0We provide warranties on vehicles we sell.\u00a0\u00a0Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage, and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale.\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the costs associated with this warranty coverage provided on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of field service actions (i.e., safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns), and for customer satisfaction actions.  For additional information regarding warranty and related costs, see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d in Item\u00a07 and Note\u00a025 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.  Wholesales  Wholesales consist primarily of vehicles sold to dealerships.  For the majority of such sales, we recognize revenue when we ship the vehicles to our dealerships from our manufacturing facilities.  See Item 7 for additional discussion of revenue recognition practices.  Wholesales in each region and in certain key markets within each region during the past three years were as follows:\u00a0Wholesales (a)(in thousands of units)\u00a0202020212022United States1,826\u00a01,716\u00a02,012\u00a0Canada210\u00a0233\u00a0258\u00a0Mexico34\u00a040\u00a042\u00a0North America2,081\u00a02,006\u00a02,335\u00a0Brazil135\u00a027\u00a021\u00a0Argentina31\u00a026\u00a031\u00a0South America 185\u00a081\u00a083\u00a0United Kingdom208\u00a0227\u00a0263\u00a0Germany211\u00a0152\u00a0182\u00a0EU20 (b)904\u00a0806\u00a0910\u00a0T\u00fcrkiye102\u00a072\u00a085\u00a0Europe1,020\u00a0891\u00a01,014\u00a0China (c)617\u00a0649\u00a0495\u00a0Australia57\u00a070\u00a071\u00a0India46\u00a034\u00a0\u2014\u00a0ASEAN (d)67\u00a075\u00a0102\u00a0Russia14\u00a022\u00a03\u00a0International Markets Group284\u00a0315\u00a0304\u00a0Total Company4,187\u00a03,942\u00a04,231\u00a0 T\u00fcrkiye __________ (a)Wholesale unit volumes include sales of medium and heavy trucks.

For additional information about our investment in Argo AI, see Note\u00a014 of our Notes to the Financial Statements.  Effective January 1, 2023, our Ford Next segment (formerly Mobility) primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in complementary market segments.  5 5 5  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  FORD CREDIT SEGMENT  The Ford Credit segment is comprised of the Ford Credit business on a consolidated basis, which is primarily vehicle-related financing and leasing activities.    Ford Credit offers a wide variety of automotive financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the world.\u00a0\u00a0The predominant share of Ford Credit\u2019s business consists of financing our vehicles and supporting our dealers.\u00a0\u00a0Ford Credit earns its revenue primarily from payments made under retail installment sale and finance lease (retail financing) and operating lease contracts that it originates and purchases; interest rate supplements and other support payments from us and our affiliates; and payments made under dealer financing programs.  As a result of these financing activities, Ford Credit has a large portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases which it classifies into two portfolios \u2014\u201cconsumer\u201d and \u201cnon-consumer.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Finance receivables and operating leases in the consumer portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of our vehicles from dealers for personal and commercial use.\u00a0\u00a0Retail financing includes retail installment sale contracts for new and used vehicles and finance leases (comprised of sales-type and direct financing leases) for new vehicles to retail and commercial customers, including leasing companies, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers.  Finance receivables in the non-consumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers.  Ford Credit makes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance other dealer vehicle programs.\u00a0\u00a0Ford Credit also purchases receivables generated by us and our affiliates, primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies.  Ford Credit also provides financing to us for vehicles that we lease to our employees.  The majority of Ford Credit\u2019s business is in the United States and Canada.  Outside of the United States, Europe is Ford Credit\u2019s largest operation.  Ford Credit\u2019s European operations are managed primarily through its United Kingdom-based subsidiary, FCE Bank plc (\u201cFCE\u201d).  Within Europe, Ford Credit\u2019s largest markets are the United Kingdom and Germany.  See Item 7 and Notes 10 and 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of Ford Credit\u2019s receivables, credit losses, allowance for credit losses, loss-to-receivables ratios, funding sources, and funding strategies.  See Item 7A for a discussion of how Ford Credit manages its financial market risks.  We routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers\u2019 customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit.\u00a0\u00a0In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer\u2019s customer.  These programs increase Ford Credit\u2019s financing volume and share.\u00a0\u00a0See Note\u00a02 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information about our accounting for these programs.  We have a Third Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement with Ford Credit, pursuant to which, if Ford Credit\u2019s financial statement leverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 12.5:1 (as reported in its most recent periodic report), Ford Credit could require us to make or cause to be made a capital contribution to it in an amount sufficient to have caused such financial statement leverage to have been 12.5:1.\u00a0\u00a0No capital contributions have been made pursuant to this agreement.\u00a0\u00a0In a separate agreement with FCE, Ford Credit has agreed to maintain FCE\u2019s net worth in excess of $500\u00a0million.  No payments have been made pursuant to that agreement.  Ford Credit files periodic reports with the SEC that contain additional information regarding Ford Credit.  The reports are available through Ford Credit\u2019s website located at www.fordcredit.com/investor-center and can also be found on the SEC\u2019s website located at www.sec.gov.  The foregoing information regarding Ford Credit\u2019s website and its content is for convenience only and not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Report nor filed with the SEC.  6 6 6  Item 1.

Business (Continued)  CORPORATE OTHER  Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, interest income (excluding interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio that is included in our Automotive segment) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending.  Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments.  These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company\u2019s interests.    Effective January 1, 2023, past service pension and other postretirement employee benefits (\u201cOPEB\u201d) income/expense and related assets, previously reported in the Automotive segment, were realigned to Corporate Other.     INTEREST ON DEBT  Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit.   GOVERNMENTAL STANDARDS  Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment.  In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances.  The most significant of the standards and regulations affecting us are discussed below:  Vehicle Emissions Control  U.S. Requirements - Federal and California Tailpipe Emission Standards.  Both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and the California Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) have established motor vehicle tailpipe and evaporative emissions standards that become increasingly stringent over time.  Seventeen states have adopted California\u2019s light-duty standards, four states have adopted California\u2019s heavy-duty standards, and other states are expected to join.  Both federal and California regulations also require motor vehicles to be equipped with on-board diagnostic (\u201cOBD\u201d) systems that monitor emission-related systems and components.  In addition, light- and medium-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines must be certified by EPA prior to sale in the United States and by CARB prior to sale in California and the relevant states.  Canada accepts EPA certification.  Compliance with emissions standards, OBD requirements, and related regulations can be challenging and can drive increased product development costs, warranty costs, and vehicle recalls.    CARB has adopted new emissions regulations applicable to model year 2024 heavy-duty engines, as well as extended heavy-duty warranty requirements beginning with the 2022 model year, and EPA has proposed more stringent heavy-duty standards beginning with the 2027 model year.  These rules include more stringent emissions standards, as well as new requirements affecting durability testing, warranty, and OBD.  CARB has also adopted new light-duty emissions standards applicable to 2026 model year vehicles, including a more stringent emissions standard and other new emissions requirements.  These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development of light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines.   Compliance with automobile emissions standards depends in part on the widespread availability of high-quality and consistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use.  Legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments related to fuel quality at both the national and state levels could affect vehicle manufacturers\u2019 warranty costs as well as their ability to comply with vehicle emissions standards. 7 7 7 Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  The California vehicle emissions program also includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale zero-emission vehicles (\u201cZEVs\u201d).  California\u2019s light-duty vehicle ZEV regulation, which uses a system based on credits that can be banked and carried forward, mandates annual increases in the production and sale of battery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles.  For 2025 model year, this regulation will require approximately 22% of a manufacturer\u2019s California light-duty vehicle sales volume be ZEVs. In August 2022, California approved a sweeping revision to the ZEV regulation.  Beginning with the 2026 model year, the revised ZEV rule mandates a 35% ZEV sales requirement, rising to 100% by 2035.  The revised regulation also imposes significant restrictions on credit usage, and new requirements for EV battery durability.  California has also instituted ZEV regulations governing medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, beginning with the 2024 model year.  These stringent ZEV requirements covering light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles could entail significant costs and compliance challenges, and include complex warranty and recall requirements.  Compliance with ZEV rules depends on market conditions (including the pace of adoption of EVs), technology readiness, and battery raw material availability as well as the availability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging.   European Requirements.  European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and U.K. regulations, directives, and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU and the United Kingdom.  Regulatory stringency has increased significantly with the application of Stage VI emission standards (first introduced in 2014) and the implementation of a laboratory test cycle for CO2 and emissions and the introduction of on-road emission testing using portable emission analyzers (Real Driving Emission or \u201cRDE\u201d).  These on-road emission tests are in addition to the laboratory-based tests (first introduced in 2017).  The divergence between the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory conditions and the allowed values measured in RDE tests will ultimately be reduced to zero as the regulatory demands increase.  In addition, new requirements for tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions will be included in the upcoming Euro 7 regulation, and the lead-time for engineering and type approval may potentially be too short.  The costs associated with complying with all of these requirements are significant, and following the EU Commission\u2019s indication of its intent to accelerate emissions rules in its road map publication \u201cEU Green Deal\u201d as well as the EU sustainable mobility action plan, these challenges will continue in European markets, including the United Kingdom.  In addition, the Whole Vehicle Type Approval (\u201cWVTA\u201d) regulation has been updated to increase the stringency of in-market surveillance.  Moreover, following the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, we may be subject to diverging requirements in our European markets, which could increase vehicle complexity and duties.  There is an increasing trend of city access restrictions for internal combustion engine powered vehicles.  The access rules being introduced are developed by individual cities based on their specific concerns, resulting in rapid deployment of access rules that differ greatly among cities.  The speed of implementation of access rules may directly influence customer vehicle residual values and choice of next purchase.  In an effort to support the Paris Accord, some countries are adopting yearly increases in CO2 taxes, where such a system is in place, and publishing dates by when internal combustion powered vehicles may no longer be registered, e.g., Norway in 2025 and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 2030.  Other National Requirements.  Many countries, in an effort to address air quality and climate change concerns, are adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (\u201cUN-ECE\u201d) mobile source emission regulations.  Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or U.S. regulations.  For example, the China Stage VI light-duty vehicle emission standards, based on European Stage VI emission standards for light-duty vehicles, U.S. evaporative and refueling emissions standards, and CARB OBD II requirements, incorporate two levels of stringency for tailpipe emissions.  Under the level one (VI(a)) standard, which is currently in place nationwide in China, the emissions limits are comparable to the EU Stage VI limits, except for carbon monoxide, which is 30% lower than the EU Stage VI limit.  The more stringent level two (VI(b)) standard\u2019s emissions limits are approximately 30-50% lower than the EU Stage VI limits, depending on the  pollutant.  While level two (VI(b)) is not slated for nationwide implementation  until July 2023, the government has encouraged the more economically developed cities and provinces to pull ahead implementation.  For example, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei province, and Guangdong province have all begun implementing level two (VI(b)).  Both China Stage VII light-duty vehicle and heavy duty vehicle emission regulations are currently under pre-study, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has advised that the Stage VII regulations will have more stringent limits on pollutant emissions and will establish limits for greenhouse gas (primarily CO2) tailpipe emissions. In South America, most countries are evolving to implement more stringent requirements accepting Europe and U.S. regulations, except Brazil, which has a unique local process called PROCONVE based on U.S. regulations for light-duty vehicles and European regulations for heavy-duty vehicles.   8 8 8 Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Canadian criteria emissions regulations are largely aligned with U.S. requirements; however, the existing ZEV regulations in Quebec and those published in British Columbia in July 2020 are more stringent than those in place in California.  Both British Columbia and Quebec have proposed draft amendments to their regulations to increase requirements starting in 2025 and 2026, respectively.  The federal government has published draft light-duty ZEV sales requirements through an amendment to the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations and has also published its intent to develop ZEV sales requirements for heavy-duty vehicles.  Other provinces have signaled their interest in light-duty ZEV sales regulations but are awaiting the finalization of the federal ZEV regulations.  Elsewhere, there is a mix of regulations and processes based on U.S. and EU standards.  Not all countries have adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted.  This could lead to compliance problems, particularly if OBD or in-use surveillance requirements are implemented.  Global Developments.  In recent years, EPA and CARB have increased their focus on the use of \u201cdefeat devices.\u201d  Defeat devices are elements of design (typically embedded in software) that improperly cause the emission control system to function less effectively during normal on-road driving than during an official laboratory emissions test, without justification.  They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, and we do not use defeat devices in our vehicles.  Regulators around the world continue to scrutinize automakers\u2019 emission testing, which has led to a number of defeat device settlements by various manufacturers.  EPA is carrying out additional non-standard tests as part of its vehicle certification program.  CARB has also been conducting extensive non-standard emission tests, which in some cases have resulted in certification delays for diesel vehicles.  In the past, several European countries have conducted non-standard emission tests and published the results, and, in some cases, this supplemental testing has triggered investigations of manufacturers for possible defeat devices.  Testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis.  In addition, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are pursuing consumer class action lawsuits based on alleged excessive emissions from cars and trucks, which could, in turn, prompt further investigations by regulators.  Vehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Standards  U.S. Requirements - Light-Duty Vehicles.  Federal law requires that light-duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy (\u201cCAFE\u201d) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d).  Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years.  The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturer\u2019s fleet of domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light-duty trucks.  EPA also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions under the Clean Air Act.  Because the vast majority of GHGs emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion, GHG emission standards are similar to fuel economy standards.  Thus, NHTSA and EPA coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards, respectively, to avoid potential inconsistencies.  Beginning with the 2012 model year, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated harmonized GHG and fuel economy regulations under what came to be known as the \u201cOne National Program\u201d (\u201cONP\u201d) framework.  California, which had promulgated its own state-specific set of GHG regulations, agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with its own GHG requirements, thereby avoiding a patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state GHG standards.  ONP has required manufacturers to achieve increasingly stringent year-over-year standards.    ONP was envisioned to continue at least through the 2025 model year.  In 2020, EPA introduced significantly less stringent fuel economy and GHG standards applicable to model years 2021-2026.  The federal government also revoked California\u2019s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that opted in to California\u2019s standards.  California continued to assert its authority to regulate vehicle GHGs, challenged in court the federal government\u2019s preemption actions, withdrew from ONP, and planned to return to enforcing its own state-specific GHG standards.     9 9 9 Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  The litigation over both standards and preemption, with uncertain outcomes, created difficulty for purposes of Ford\u2019s future product planning.  To avoid a \u201cbifurcated\u201d regulatory scenario in which California and the 15 other states that adopted California\u2019s GHG standards enforce one set of rules, while a different set of rules applies in the rest of the country, Ford reached an agreement with California on a set of terms for an alternative framework in which Ford committed to meet a designated set of standards on a national basis in lieu of the California regulatory program.  This framework enabled Ford to continue its product planning on a nationwide basis, while being consistent with Ford\u2019s environmental goals.  Ford finalized its agreement with California in 2020, and other states that adopted the California standards indicated they would respect the agreement.  In 2021, EPA again re-evaluated the stringency of light-duty fuel economy and GHG standards through the 2026 model year, and considered whether to restore the stringency to the previous ONP levels, or greater.  EPA finalized this evaluation in December 2021, establishing GHG standards applicable to model years 2023-2026 with stringency that exceeded ONP levels.  In 2022, NHTSA finalized more stringent fuel economy standards for model years 2024-2026, which are substantially aligned with EPA\u2019s GHG standards.  The federal government also acted in December 2021 to repeal its rule blocking California\u2019s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that adopted California\u2019s standards, and EPA took similar action in early 2022 under the Clean Air Act.  In late 2022, EPA began consideration of sweeping changes to light-duty GHG regulations for model years 2027 and beyond.  These regulations are expected to extend through at least the 2030 model year, and to drive significant ZEV sales mix, along with rapid improvement of ICE vehicle performance, by virtue of greatly increased stringency.  These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development of light-duty vehicles.  If any federal or state agency imposes and enforces fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions, Ford would likely be forced to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on its sales volumes and results of operations.  Such actions likely would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options; increasing market support programs for Ford\u2019s most fuel-efficient vehicles; and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicles, such as high-performance cars, utilities, and/or full-size light trucks in order to maintain compliance.  U.S. Requirements - Heavy-Duty Vehicles.  EPA and NHTSA have jointly promulgated GHG and fuel economy standards for heavy-duty vehicles (generally, vehicles over 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating) through the 2027 model year, and EPA is preparing a major update to these standards for the 2027 model year and beyond.  In Ford\u2019s case, the standards primarily affect heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, plus vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks.  As the heavy-duty standards increase in stringency, it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavy-duty trucks.  European Requirements.  The European Union regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle CO2 emissions using sliding scales with different CO2 targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles first registered in a calendar year, with separate targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.  A penalty system applies to manufacturers failing to meet the individual CO2 targets.  Pooling agreements between manufacturers to utilize credits are possible under certain conditions, and we have entered into such pooling agreements in order to comply with fuel economy regulations without paying a penalty and to enable other manufacturers to benefit from our positive CO2 performance.  For \u201cmulti-stage vehicles\u201d (e.g., Ford\u2019s Transit chassis cabs), the base manufacturer (e.g., Ford) is fully responsible for the CO2 performance of the final up-fitted vehicles.  The initial target levels get significantly more stringent every five years (2025, 2030, and 2035, after which all new vehicles must be zero emission), requiring significant investments in propulsion technologies and extensive fleet management forcing low CO2 emissions.  The United Kingdom and Switzerland have introduced similar rules, and the United Kingdom is considering adopting ZEV mandates.  The EU Commission is investigating the introduction of Real Driving CO2 and Life Cycle Assessment elements, and heavy-duty vehicles are addressed in separate regulations with analogous requirements and challenges.  As discussed above, the EU Commission has announced a \u201cGreen Deal\u201d that is likely to trigger more stringent requirements for CO2 emissions (including stricter CO2 fleet regulations) and other regulated emissions and include recycling and substance restrictions.  While the EU Commission targets net climate neutrality by 2050 and a more ambitious 2030 interim target (a 55% instead of 40% CO2 reduction compared to 1990), several countries, such as Germany, have adopted stricter interim targets and earlier net climate neutrality targets.  Ford also faces the risk of advance premium payments for both passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in all European markets due to, for example, unexpected market fluctuations and shorter lead times impacting average fleet performance.   10 10 10 Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  The United Nations developed a technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO2.  This world light-duty test procedure (\u201cWLTP\u201d) is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO2 and fuel consumption figures with customer-reported figures.  The introduction of WLTP in Europe started in September 2017 and requires updates to CO2 labeling, thereby impacting taxes in countries with a CO2 tax scheme as well as CO2 fleet regulations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.  Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP are significant.  Some European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO2 vehicle emissions, including fiscal measures and CO2 labeling to address country specific targets associated with the Paris Accord.  For example, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced taxation based on CO2 emissions.  The EU CO2 requirements are likely to trigger further measures.  In addition, delayed vehicle launches and supply shortages, as well as an insufficient charging infrastructure and lower demand for ZEV and low CO2 emission vehicles as certain electric vehicle incentives are reduced, can trigger compliance risks in all European markets.  Other National Requirements.  The Canadian federal government regulates vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.  In October 2014, the Canadian federal government published the final changes to the regulation for light-duty vehicles, which maintain alignment with U.S. EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 2017-2025 model years.  The revised U.S. EPA standards were automatically adopted in Canada by reference for the 2022-2025 model years, and draft amendments for a few standalone administrative elements not automatically adopted by reference were published in December 2022.  The heavy-duty vehicle and engine GHG emissions regulations for the 2021 model year and beyond were published in May 2018 and are in line with U.S. requirements, subject to any change in those requirements.    China\u2019s Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle (\u201cNEV\u201d) Credit Administrative Rules contain fuel consumption requirements as well as credit mandates for NEV passenger vehicles, i.e., plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, or fuel cell vehicles.  The fuel consumption requirement uses a weight-based approach to establish targets, with year-over-year target reductions.  China set a target of 5.0L/100km for the 2020 passenger vehicle industry fuel consumption fleet average, which lowers to 4.0L/100km by 2025 based on the New European Driving Cycle system.  The government is projecting a further fuel consumption reduction in 2030, and is targeting 3.5L/100km based on the WLTP cycle (\u201cWLTC\u201d) system.  The NEV mandate requires that OEMs generate a specific amount of NEV credits each year, with NEV credits of at least 16%, 18%, 28%, and 38% of the annual ICE passenger vehicle production or import volume required in 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively.  Future percentages are currently under consideration.  As discussed below in Item 1A. Risk Factors under \u201cFord may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous vehicle, and other regulations,\u201d a production disruption, stop ship, lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles, or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans or, in some cases, purchase credits in order to comply with fuel economy standards.   Vehicle Safety  U.S. Requirements.  The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the \u201cSafety Act\u201d) regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways.  First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA.  Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly and has continued to evolve as global compliance and public domain (e.g., New Car Assessment Programs (\u201cNCAPs\u201d), Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (\u201cIIHS\u201d)) requirements continue to evolve, are increasing in demands, and lack harmonization globally.  As we expand our business priorities to include autonomous vehicles and broader mobility products and services, our financial exposure has increased.  Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns.  A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard.  Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.  European Requirements.  The EU has established vehicle safety standards and regulations and is likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in the future, especially in the areas of access to in-vehicle data, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0   11 11 11 Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  The European General Safety Regulation (\u201cGSR\u201d) introduced UN-ECE regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval process.  The GSR includes the mandatory introduction of multiple active and passive safety features, including cybersecurity requirements for new vehicle models from 2022 and for all registrations in 2024.  EU regulators are focusing on active safety features, such as lane departure warning systems, electronic stability control, and automatic brake assist.  Furthermore, mobile network providers in certain EU Member States have begun shutting down their 2G and 3G networks, which form the basis for e-Call system functionality in existing vehicles.  The e-Call systems in existing vehicles may need to be updated as these systems are phased out.  It is also possible that the EU may mandate Member States to maintain these networks to allow for the continued functionality of existing e-Call systems.  Other National Requirements.  Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with minor variations to address local concerns.  Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to the development of global platform vehicles, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing a common level of safety performance; several on-going bilateral negotiations on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal.  Safety and recall requirements in Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and Gulf Cooperation Council (\u201cGCC\u201d) countries may add substantial costs and complexity to our global recall practice.  Brazil has set mandatory fleet safety targets and penalties are applied if these levels are not maintained, while a tax reduction may be available for over-performance.  In Canada, regulatory requirements are currently aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act, the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety.  In 2021, Canada started preliminary consultations on several new proposed regulations, including Administrative Monetary Penalties (\u201cAMPs\u201d) and Analysis of Technical Information for Vehicles and Equipment (\u201cACTIVE\u201d) regulations.  Draft language for the AMPs regulation was published in May 2022 with final regulations expected to be published at the end of 2023.  In China, a new mandatory Event Data Recorder regulation that is more comprehensive than U.S. requirements has been released, and in China, Malaysia, and South Korea, mandatory e-Call requirements are being drafted.  E-Call is mandatory in the UAE for new vehicles starting with the 2021 model year, and in Saudi Arabia from the 2025 model year.  New Car Assessment Programs.  Organizations around the world rate and compare motor vehicles in NCAPs to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles.  NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle safety, with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest.  Achieving high NCAP ratings, which may vary by country or region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.  Similarly, environmental rating systems exist in various regions, e.g., Green NCAP in Europe.  In China, C-NCAP has a stringent rating structure to decrease the number of five-star ratings.  Further, the China Insurance Auto Safety Index (similar to IIHS) has been implemented, with higher standards for passenger and pedestrian protection and driver assistance technologies. These protocols impose additional requirements relating to testing, evaluation, and mandatory safety features, and compliance with them (or any subsequent updates to them) may be costly. 12 12 12  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES  People Strategy and Governance  We strive to create an employee experience that enables an inclusive environment of excellence, focus, and collaboration among team members, allowing us to deliver short- and long-term business success.  Ford maintains an Executive People Forum consisting of the CEO and top leadership team that meets monthly with a specific focus on people and organizational topics that will enable and accelerate delivery of the business plan.  Key topic areas include Compensation & Retention, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d), Organization Design, Talent Planning & Development, and Culture.  Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters, including items discussed at the Executive People Forum.  The Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee maintains responsibility to review, discuss, and set strategic direction for various people-related business strategies, including:  compensation and benefit programs; leadership succession planning; culture; DEI; and talent development programs.  The Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee is responsible for discussing and advising management on maintaining and improving sustainability strategies, the implementation of which creates value consistent with the long-term preservation and enhancement of shareholder value and social wellbeing, including human rights, working conditions, and responsible sourcing.  The collective recommendations to the Board and its committees are how we proactively manage our human capital and create an employee experience that allows employees and our organization to thrive.    Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  At Ford, we believe that creating a Culture of Inclusion for all our employees is both foundational to achieving our Ford+ plan and the right thing to do.  Ford offers 12 Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) that represent various dimensions of our employee population, including racial, ethnic, gender, religious, sexual orientation and gender identity, ability, and generational communities with chapters throughout the world, in addition to Ford Advocacy for Belonging (\u201cFAB\u201d) Councils in every region.  Our ERGs and FAB Councils are instrumental in providing a voice to our globally diverse workforce as well as sharing valuable insights into the development of products, services, and experiences.    Our business has developed DEI action plans specific to each region\u2019s unique needs and culture.  From an enterprise perspective, we have taken several concrete steps to further these efforts, including embedding DEI into our corporate strategy and governance, ensuring that revisions to employee expected behaviors enable an inclusive culture, and establishing objectives for progress for every salaried employee.  This holistic DEI strategy includes a strong focus on racial equity, growing representation of diverse talent throughout the pipeline, and DEI education.     Our diversity statistics include the following as of December 31, 2022 (based on self-reporting at the date of hire):  28.8% of our salaried employees worldwide are females (excludes certain employees in Europe in accordance with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation); 25.4% of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States are females; and 36.2% of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States are minorities.    Talent Attraction, Growth, and Capability Assessment  The workplace is quickly evolving, and new working practices are constantly developing.  Many employees are no longer bound to physical locations, where and how we source our talent is evolving, and employee expectations have shifted.  From a growth perspective, we are focused on several key areas vital to our success (e.g., software, electrification, and data science).  Ford continues to accelerate its efforts to attract new employees with diverse skill sets and capabilities, and more resources have been dedicated to recruiting these employees, who are critical to supporting our business model.  From a capability perspective, we are leveraging best practices in assessments and talent management to strengthen our current capabilities and future pipeline while reinforcing a culture of belonging, collaboration, empowerment, and innovation.  The performance management process is reviewed regularly to ensure we set clear expectations, measure individual performance, and reward appropriately.  We are also creating targeted learning experiences, democratizing learning and career development opportunities across the organization, and empowering employees to design their own career paths with skill development targeted for the roles of today and the future.    13 13 13 Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Item 1.  Business (Continued)  Finally, the extent to which our People Leaders are equipped to care for, inspire, and empower our people plays a vital role in our strategy, and we are committed to helping our leaders strengthen these capabilities with dedicated learning paths and non-traditional learning opportunities.  Our Leadership+ mechanism for developing People Leaders guides how we think about performance management and how we assess our talent to meet our organizational needs.  Leadership+ will continue to prepare and empower our People Leaders to lead our teams through significant change at our Company and in our industry.  Employee Health and Safety  Nothing is more important than the health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees, and we consistently strive to achieve world-class levels of safety through the application of sound policies and best practices.  We maintain a robust safety culture to reduce workplace injuries, supported by effective communication, reporting, and external benchmarking.  We verify compliance with regulatory requirements as well as our internal safety standards and regularly report to Company management on key safety issues, including significant incidents and high potential near-misses, to prevent recurrences.  We also participate in multi-industry groups, within and outside the automotive sector, to share safety best practices and collaborate to address common issues.  Our Safety Record  Any loss of life or serious injury in the workplace is unacceptable and deeply regretted.  Unfortunately, there were two fatal incidents in 2022 in our China region.  Another key safety indicator is our global lost-time case rate (\u201cLTCR\u201d), which is defined as the number of cases where one or more working days is lost due to work-related injury/illness per 200,000 hours worked.  While our global LTCR remains stable overall, there was an increase to 0.39 in 2022 from 0.35 in 2021.  We will continue our efforts to reduce workplace injuries.    Employee Wellbeing Initiatives  Our global, holistic approach to wellbeing encompasses the financial, social, mental/emotional, physical, and professional needs of our employees.  Foundational to our wellbeing philosophy is providing a broad array of resources and solutions to educate employees, build capability, and meet individual and organizational wellbeing needs and goals.  Wellbeing is an integral part of our total rewards strategy as we work to address business and employee challenges through a multi-channel approach that provides our diverse populations and global regions flexibility and choice to meet their specific needs.  We use data-driven insights gathered through surveys, focus groups, and claims data to understand employee needs and prioritize our wellbeing efforts.  We provide global wellbeing programs, such as Employee Assistance Programs and mindfulness sessions, among other things.  In addition, we provide employees with experiences, self-guided tools, and social connection opportunities, as well as access to the professional support and resources they need to achieve their own sense of wellbeing.  We are committed to creating an environment where employees and People Leaders care for each other as we deliver Ford+.  Employee Sentiment Strategy  We leverage our ask/listen/observe framework to understand employee sentiment at Ford.  This approach is a holistic and consistent methodology that enables us to understand how employees are feeling in real time and act accordingly.  Our measurement focuses on several areas that are key to our business:  Employee Mental and Emotional Wellbeing, Health & Safety, Employee Experience, Culture, DEI, Leadership, and Strategic Alignment.  Our employee sentiment surveys guide the actions we take to address employee concerns and related risks, and also help us understand whether our efforts to drive change in these areas are effective.  A critical element of our measurement program is ensuring that data ends up in the hands of those who are best positioned to drive meaningful change.  To this end, leaders at all levels have access to dashboards with data from their teams and organizations, as well as personalized next step recommendations embedded into action planning tools.  Our measurement approach is also used to inform our areas of focus as an organization and to evaluate the effectiveness of talent initiatives across the enterprise.    14 14 14 Item 1.
