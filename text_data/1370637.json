{"cik": 1370637, "item_1A": "Item 1. Business.  Overview Our Mission Etsy\u2019s mission to \u201cKeep Commerce Human\u201d is rooted in our belief that, although automation and commoditization are parts of modern life, human creativity cannot be automated and human connection cannot be commoditized. We believe consumers are demanding more of the businesses they support and companies that build win-win solutions that are good for people, the planet, and profit will be best positioned to succeed. We are committed to growing sustainably by aligning our mission and business strategy to help create economic impact through entrepreneurship. You can read more about Etsy\u2019s Impact and environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) strategies beginning on page 21, where we report on metrics aligned with both our self-identified Impact priorities and widely accepted third-party frameworks. About our Company Etsy operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world. These marketplaces - which collectively create a \u201cHouse of Brands\u201d - share our mission, common levers for growth, similar business models, and a strong commitment to use business and technology to strengthen communities and empower people. Our primary marketplace,\u00a0Etsy.com, is the global destination for unique and creative goods made by independent sellers. The Etsy marketplace connects creative artisans and entrepreneurs with thoughtful consumers looking for items that are a joyful expression of their taste and values. Our sellers are the heart and soul of Etsy, and our technology platform allows our sellers to turn their creative passions into economic opportunity. We have a seller-aligned business model: we make money when our sellers make money. We offer Etsy.com sellers a marketplace with tens of millions of buyers along with a range of seller tools and services that are specifically designed to help our creative entrepreneurs generate more sales and scale their businesses. In addition to our core Etsy marketplace, our \u201cHouse of Brands\u201d consists of Reverb Holdings, Inc. (\u201cReverb\u201d), our musical instrument marketplace acquired in 2019, Depop Limited (\u201cDepop\u201d), our fashion resale marketplace, and Elo7 Servi\u00e7os de Inform\u00e1tica S.A. (\u201cElo7\u201d), our Brazil-based marketplace for handmade and unique items. Both Depop and Elo7 were acquired in July 2021. Our marketplaces primarily operate independently, although some of our key operational functions such as finance, legal, and human resources, for example, support all four marketplaces to some extent. The Reverb, Depop, and Elo7 marketplaces are included in all financial and other metrics discussed in this report, unless otherwise noted, from their respective dates of acquisition.  Our sellers generated $13.3 billion of Gross Merchandise sales (\u201cGMS\u201d) in 2022. Of this, Etsy marketplace GMS was $11.8 billion or 88.3% of the total and Reverb, Depop, and Elo7 marketplaces generated approximately $942.5 million (7.1% of the total), $552.1 million (4.1% of the total), and $69.7 million (0.5% of the total) of GMS, respectively. We anticipate that the Etsy marketplace will continue to be the primary driver of our overall financial performance for the foreseeable future. Here are a few key statistics about our marketplaces: \u2022The Etsy, Reverb, Depop, and Elo7 marketplaces collectively connected a total of 7.5 million active sellers to 95.1 million active buyers as of December\u00a031, 2022. \u2022Our top six retail categories on the Etsy marketplace in 2022 were homewares and home furnishings, jewelry and personal accessories, apparel, craft supplies, paper and party supplies, and toys and games. Toys and games replaced beauty and personal care in our top six. These categories represented approximately $10 billion, or 86% of 2022 GMS.  \u2022Reverb provides a significant presence in the market for musical instruments, Depop extends our apparel offering into the resale space, and Elo7 expands our geographic opportunity with a local brand in Brazil. \u2022We are a global company, and 44% of our consolidated 2022 GMS was generated when a seller or buyer, or both, were located outside of the United States. \u2022Approximately\u00a067%\u00a0of our 2022 consolidated GMS came from purchases made on mobile devices, with mobile app being the fastest growing device for the Etsy marketplace.  1 1  1 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our Strategy  As illustrated below, our strategy is focused around:  \u2022Building a sustainable competitive advantage - our \u201cRight to Win;\u201d \u2022Growing the Etsy marketplace in our seven core geographies; and \u2022Leveraging our marketplace playbook across our \u201cHouse of Brands.\u201d  Building a sustainable competitive advantage - our \u201cRight to Win\u201d Our \u201cRight to Win\u201d is centered on four key elements that we believe make Etsy.com a better place to shop and sell and, which, in turn, will bring more buyers, lead to increased frequency and size of purchases, and build trust in the Etsy marketplace. We believe that when executed effectively, these elements can create a multiplier effect that will drive future growth. Our sellers\u2019 collection of unique items: The foundation of Etsy.com\u2019s competitive advantage is our sellers\u2019 collection of millions of unique items. Sellers choose to list their collections of unique items on our marketplace because they believe that we are the best place for them to start and grow a creative business and that we have created a community that attracts, supports, and retains some of the world\u2019s most talented makers. The unique nature of our sellers\u2019 items requires that we invest in the other three elements of our strategy: search and discovery, human connections, and our trusted brand in order to deliver a best-in-class marketplace experience. Best-in-class search and discovery: We are focused on continuing to develop a search and discovery experience that unlocks the value of the unique items that can be found on the Etsy marketplace. With over a hundred million items listed on Etsy.com that don\u2019t map to a catalog or a stock keeping unit (\u201cSKU\u201d), our challenge is delivering world-class search and discovery technology that surfaces the right unique product to the right buyer at the right time in order to drive sales and buyer satisfaction. We use a combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and human curation to help personalize the search experience and enable Etsy buyers to more easily browse, filter, and find the items they desire. We\u2019re investing in multiple areas focused on understanding buyer tastes and preferences as we strive to anticipate and inspire their next purchase.  The power of human connections: Our mission to \u201cKeep Commerce Human\u201d is a vital part of our strategy. We continue to emphasize the role that humans play in every aspect of our business. What makes the Etsy marketplace special isn\u2019t just the unique items in our marketplace, it\u2019s also the stories of how those items were brought to life by the hands of real people. Our buyer experience allows Etsy buyers to work with Etsy sellers to personalize or customize items to their exact specifications. We believe that fostering and elevating the quality of these human connections will continue to enable us to drive buyer engagement, loyalty, and purchase frequency, thus differentiating Etsy.com from other places you can shop.  Our trusted brand: We will continue to focus on being a reliable brand that inspires trust along the buyer journey \u2014 when buyers search, purchase, anticipate, and receive their special items, and all the steps in between. Since Etsy sellers have relatively unknown brands and unbranded items, we aim to ensure that the Etsy brand is recognized and valued for providing an excellent end-to-end experience. There are two key elements to being a trusted brand: standing for something that buyers understand and rely on, and delivering a purchasing experience that feels efficient and safe. Our goal is to bolster trust in the Etsy brand, Etsy sellers, the items available on Etsy, and in the overall Etsy experience. We also need to be reliable for our sellers, offering a suite of compelling services to help sellers comply with marketplace policies and have peace of mind transacting on Etsy. Growing the Etsy marketplace in our seven core geographies: We are focused on growing the Etsy marketplace in our seven core geographies (as illustrated above). While we have sellers and buyers around the world, we define our core geographies as locations that meet any of the following criteria:  \u2022represent our most attractive GMS opportunities,  \u2022where we currently have or believe we can create a vibrant two-sided marketplace, or  2 2  2 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022where we\u2019re making strategic investments in domestic growth. We will also continue to evaluate additional geographies for strategic investments.  Leveraging our marketplace playbook across our \u201cHouse of Brands\u201d We have four values-aligned e-commerce marketplaces offering non-commoditized items in our \u201cHouse of Brands:\u201d Etsy, Reverb, Depop, and Elo7. Each of these marketplaces stands for creativity, community, and \u201cspecial\u201d and shares common commitments to operate in a way that makes a positive impact on the world. Our goal is that all four marketplaces benefit from shared expertise in product, marketing, technology, and customer support, and that the sum of the whole, over time, will equal more than its individual parts. We believe our marketplaces all share key elements central to success, including: \u2022analytical frameworks, product experiment and measurement approaches, and operating rhythms that prioritize resource allocation towards the most impactful outcomes,  \u2022sophisticated search and discovery technology,  \u2022compelling on-site customer experiences,  \u2022efficient payment platforms,  \u2022value-added seller services, such as advertising platforms and effective shipping options,  \u2022strong brand and performance marketing capabilities, and \u2022a commitment to investments that protect the marketplace.  Since acquiring each business, we have invested in leveraging high-performing talent across Etsy and the other \u201cHouse of Brands\u201d marketplaces to accelerate value creation and idea pollination across our four marketplaces. We continue to invest in cross-functional, cross-marketplace initiatives that accelerate the application of best practices in domains relevant to all our businesses, some of which have been listed above. Some specific examples of cross-marketplace collaboration include application of proven techniques for making search more efficient, fulfillment and trust initiatives, optimization of performance marketing attribution models, and experience with brand research and awareness campaigns.   Etsy\u2019s overall capital allocation strategy is focused in three areas: core investments in organic growth, which includes investments in our \u201cHouse of Brands;\u201d selectively pursuing acquisitions of businesses or technologies that complement our marketplaces or align with our overall growth strategy; and mitigating dilution to our stockholders through stock repurchase programs that have and may continue to be authorized by our Board of Directors.  3 3  3 Table of Contents Table of Contents  How We Make Money We see our business model as a virtuous circle - we connect sellers and buyers, enable their transactions, receive fees for our services, and then reinvest in customer experiences to further grow Etsy and our sellers\u2019 revenue. We generate revenue primarily from marketplace activities, including transaction, listing, and payments processing fees, and fees for optional seller services, which include on-site advertising and shipping labels. For more information, see Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014 Components of Our Results of Operations\u2014Revenue.\u201d On April 11, 2022, we increased the Etsy marketplace seller transaction fee. As part of our long standing principle to provide a \u201cfair exchange of value\u201d for the fee Etsy earns on marketplace transactions, we reinvested most of the incremental revenue generated from the transaction fee increase into the following: (a) expanding our engineering headcount, allocating a meaningful portion to Product Development initiatives targeted to improve customer experiences; (b) continuing to increase our Marketing spending; (c) launching the Etsy Purchase Protection program; and (d) increasing investments in Trust & Safety and Member Support.

We are focused on attracting potential buyers to Etsy for everyday items that have meaning and those \u201cspecial\u201d purchase occasions that happen throughout the year. These include items that reflect an individual\u2019s unique style; gifting that demonstrates thought and care; and celebrations that express creativity and fun. Style(me)Gifting(you)Celebration(us)    Etsy purchase occasions can happen frequently throughout the year - when a buyer is decorating a home, selecting an outfit for a special event, planning a celebration for a special moment, or buying a gift for someone else. In fact, according to a 2022 Etsy buyer survey:  We believe the Etsy marketplace is characterized by several unique qualities, including: \u2022A brand that stands for \u201cIntentional Shopping:\u201d In a world of increasing automation and commoditization, Etsy.com is a marketplace where creativity lives and thrives because it\u2019s powered by people. We help our community of sellers turn their ideas into successful businesses. Our platform connects them with millions of buyers looking for an alternative\u2014something special that expresses their taste and values. \u2022Unique products: Etsy boasts a large assortment of handmade, customized, personalized, vintage, and craft supply products from all over the world. As of December\u00a031, 2022, there were more than 100 million items listed on the Etsy marketplace, and approximately 26% of our 2022 GMS was from custom or made-to-order merchandise.  \u2022Global reach: In 2022, 45% of Etsy sellers were located outside the United States, and 45% of our GMS was generated between an Etsy seller, Etsy buyer, or both, located outside of the United States. Our platform makes it easy for Etsy buyers and sellers to interact across borders even if they do not speak the same language and wish to transact in different currencies. We use innovative machine translation technology to translate listings, reviews, Etsy Ads, and conversations between buyers and sellers. We invest in localization, particularly within our core non-U.S. markets, to create a more localized experience such as browse features and shipping filters, which has resulted in more sellers selling to buyers within their own country. In 2022, approximately 70% and 80% of GMS in the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively, was from domestic sales.  \u2022Organic traffic base: The unique nature of our sellers\u2019 inventory and power of our brand have enabled us to organically build a loyal, global base of Etsy buyers on the platform. In 2022, 80% of our GMS was generated through organic channels, including a large portion from buyers visiting Etsy directly as well as from non-paid channels such as search, social, email, and push notifications.  \u2022Connection between Etsy buyers and sellers: As of December\u00a031, 2022, 89.4 million buyers and 5.4 million sellers were active on the Etsy marketplace. We emphasize that the items listed for sale on the Etsy marketplace are brought to life by real people and that buyers can connect directly with sellers in order to ask questions and personalize or customize items to their specifications. 5 5  5 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u2022Connected experience across all devices: We want to engage Etsy buyers wherever they are and provide an enjoyable and accessible shopping experience regardless of the format. Our mobile website and our Etsy mobile app for Etsy buyers (\u201cBuy on Etsy\u201d) include search and discovery, curation, personalization, augmented reality, and social shopping features. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, approximately 66% of Etsy.com GMS was generated on a mobile device. Through product investments that drive buyers to our app, we\u2019ve been able to increase app downloads by 33% in 2022, which is beneficial to our conversion rate, as our mobile app has the highest conversion rate among devices. For the full year, our Etsy App represented the largest single GMS contributor by device. \u2022Buyer intent; people come to the Etsy marketplace to browse and be inspired: Our platform is designed to provide a personalized search and discovery experience to Etsy buyers, curating search results and listings based on transaction and browsing history. We are continuing to build more sophisticated algorithms that allow us to deliver more personalized results to our buyers, with the goal of helping our buyers find both the items they want, and inspiration for their next purchase. High Level Performance Recap: Beginning in 2020 and continuing through 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and other global macroeconomic factors drove a significant shift to online purchasing in many retail categories. During this period, the Etsy marketplace experienced significant growth - more than doubling our GMS from 2019 through 2021. We believe this growth can be attributed to the diversity of our merchandise, the differentiation of our brand and shopping experience as explained above, and our capital light business model, among other factors.  As the COVID-19 pandemic eased beginning in February 2022, consumer mobility significantly increased which resulted in many more choices for individuals of where to spend their time and money, as well as greater competition for share of wallet as a result of other macroeconomic factors such as increased inflation and geopolitical events. Despite these very strong reopening headwinds in 2022, the Etsy marketplace maintained the vast majority of gains achieved during the pandemic (with 2022 GMS equal to 96% of 2021 GMS and up 148% from 2019). On a constant currency basis, Etsy\u2019s GMS declined 1% year-over-year in 2022. We believe the primary reason for maintaining our pandemic gains was Etsy\u2019s significant investments in improving the customer experience and deepening our engagement with buyers. Throughout 2022, we employed multiple strategies, some of which are outlined in the Product Development and Marketing sections below, to make shopping on Etsy more efficient, inspirational, and trustworthy. We believe another factor contributing to this performance is the diversity of the merchandise on the Etsy marketplace, as categories that were weaker during the pandemic (such as apparel or events related items) offset weakness in categories such as home and living and craft supplies, which grew significantly during that time. The Reverb Marketplace\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Reverb, headquartered in Chicago, is a two-sided marketplace launched in 2013 on the principle that buying and selling musical instruments should be easy. Reverb connects buyers and sellers of new, used, and vintage music gear from all over the world, uniting music makers with the gear that inspires them. As of December\u00a031, 2022, our Reverb marketplace had 811 thousand active buyers and 229 thousand active sellers. Reverb\u2019s buyers and sellers range from beginners looking for their first instruments to professional musicians expanding their gear collections, local music stores that use Reverb to do more business online, and the largest music retailers in the world that use Reverb to reach an even larger audience. In 2022, over 64% of Reverb\u2019s active sellers also bought on Reverb, and those that bought and sold gear spent close to three times more than those that bought gear on Reverb but did not sell on Reverb. Reverb\u2019s unique characteristics include the depth and breadth of its sellers\u2019 inventory, its range of sellers (including retailers, manufacturers, and individual sellers distributed across the globe), one of the largest musical instrument databases with historical pricing data in the world, and a large and passionate community of musicians and music gear lovers. In 2022, Reverb invested in optimizing conversion rate, delivering a more customized experience, and driving international growth.  High Level Performance Recap: In 2022, Reverb\u2019s GMS declined 0.6% from 2021 and increased approximately 1% on a constant currency basis during the same period as reopening headwinds and other macroeconomic factors, such as increased inflation and geopolitical events weighed on consumer discretionary spending. Despite these strong headwinds, Reverb, similar to Etsy, maintained the vast majority of its 2020 and 2021 GMS gains. Based upon insights from music industry trade publications and our internal estimates, we believe that Reverb continued to meaningfully outpace the growth of the musical instruments industry on a three-year basis, yet Reverb still represents less than 4% of the total available market for musical instruments. Reverb\u2019s 2022 investments included improvements to the buyer and seller experiences, including enhanced search capabilities, additional payment and shipping options, greater emphasis on affordability, and more robust customer support. In marketing, Reverb tested new advertising channels and launched a new Google integration to optimize performance marketing efficiency and better target prospective buyers with higher potential lifetime value. 6 6  6 Table of Contents Table of Contents The Depop Marketplace\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Depop, headquartered in London, is dedicated to building the world\u2019s most diverse and progressive home of fashion. Since its founding in 2011, Depop has evolved to become a community-powered fashion marketplace to buy and sell unique fashion, with approximately 30 million registered users. Depop had approximately 3.3\u00a0million active buyers and 1.8\u00a0million active sellers at December\u00a031, 2022. Approximately 55% of Depop sellers who made a sale in 2022 also made at least one purchase in 2022 which we believe shows the strong engagement of Depop\u2019s user base. Approximately 92% of Depop\u2019s GMS is in the apparel category.  Depop is a place for anyone to discover and celebrate their style on their own terms and to feel good about their fashion choices by extending the lives of millions of garments. We believe Depop has a meaningful growth opportunity given its healthy user engagement metrics, strong resale market position with the \u201cGeneration Z\u201d (\u201cGen Z\u201d) consumer demographic, and strong brand awareness in its core markets (United Kingdom and United States). As of December\u00a031, 2022, the majority of Depop\u2019s users were Gen Z (the demographic cohort succeeding Millennials and known as \u201cdigital natives\u201d as they are the first social generation to have grown up with access to the internet and portable digital technology from a young age). According to a 2022 ThredUp Annual Resale Report, which looked at trailing twelve-month data, over 60% of Gen Z and Millennial shoppers will look for an item secondhand before purchasing it new, and over 80% of first time thrifters plan to spend the same amount or more on secondhand in the next five years. ThredUp also expects the global secondhand apparel market to grow approximately three times faster than the broader global apparel market through 2026. High Level Performance Recap: In 2022, the resale market outpaced the wider online fashion industry despite challenging macroeconomic conditions including reopening headwinds, inflationary pressures, consumer discretionary spending trends, foreign exchange rate volatility, and ongoing geopolitical events. Depop experienced intensified competition and inflationary pressures impacting performance in monthly active users, visit frequency, conversion and growth. Etsy believes Depop is a highly-relevant and authentic re-commerce brand that is still early in its growth lifecycle and plans to continue to invest accordingly. In September 2022, Etsy appointed Kruti Patel Goyal, Etsy\u2019s former Chief Product Officer, to the role of Depop Chief Executive Officer. New leadership has focused on building momentum in the business, identifying the fewest, most impactful things to re-accelerate growth and improve operational efficiency in service of the Depop community. Throughout the year, Depop improved the buyer experience by increasing product velocity and infrastructure, enhancing search capabilities, building new performance marketing channels with PLA, and launching Make an Offer, Depop Payments, and Boosted Listings.  The Elo7 Marketplace\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Elo7, known as the \u201cEtsy of Brazil,\u201d was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Elo7 specializes in custom and made-to-order merchandise, connecting approximately 53\u00a0thousand active sellers and 1.6\u00a0million active buyers as of December\u00a031, 2022. Approximately 64% of Elo7\u2019s GMS is from repeat buyers. Elo7's marketplace includes items in over 40 retail categories, with a significant amount of GMS from \"special event and life moment\" categories. In 2022, Elo7\u2019s top categories were parties and events, party favors, home decor, baby and kids, and weddings. Elo7 is ranked as a top 10 e-commerce site in Brazil in terms of traffic in web and android (according to Conversion E-commerce Report in Brazil, December 2022), providing us with a strong local brand in the largest Latin American e-commerce region. High Level Performance Recap:  In 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic eased in Brazil, leading to a resumption of consumer mobility and therefore a return to in-person celebrations and events. Given Elo7\u2019s exposure to these categories, as outlined above, the business began to see improved GMS performance throughout 2022. Key areas of investment for Elo7 during the year included conversion rate improvements from investments in search, giving sellers tools to help them grow, including access to more options for fast and affordable shipping. Elo7 also began testing an online marketing campaign aimed at driving brand awareness as it builds a broader marketing strategy. Similar to Etsy, we believe that Elo7 can expand its \u201cconsideration set\u201d in the mind of Brazilian consumers, becoming a destination they turn to more frequently for more of life\u2019s special moments. 7 7  7  Table of Contents Table of Contents Primary Business Drivers   We leverage technology to connect people around the world through commerce. Among other things, we invest in our technology and infrastructure, product development, marketing, trust and safety, member support and seller tools and education as we strive to continuously improve our marketplaces for our buyers and sellers. While the discussion below focuses on the primary drivers of the Etsy marketplace, there are similar business drivers at each of our marketplaces.  Technology\u00a0Infrastructure Our engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of sellers and buyers to smoothly transact across borders, languages, and devices. This team writes, deploys, and operates the software and services that enable us to run our business, including the web and mobile products we deploy externally and internally, and maintains our cloud environment and local office networks, and more. Etsy also makes significant investments in areas such as foundational infrastructure, our payments platform, cyber security, internal information technology, data enablement, and system architecture.  We collect and analyze large volumes of data to enhance the performance of our platform, personalize search and discovery, improve our search experience, and test features on our website. Our use of machine learning algorithms on the Etsy marketplace creates an engaging shopping experience and helps Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers connect across our platform. We apply proprietary machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human curation to personalize the search and discovery experiences and enable buyers to more easily browse, filter, and buy that perfect item, even when they may not have something specific in mind. Machine translation and machine learning also play an important role in making it easy for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to connect even if they don\u2019t speak the same language. We translate listings within our Etsy marketplace, which we believe significantly increases the items available to non-English speaking Etsy buyers and gives Etsy sellers access to a truly global audience. In addition, our technology infrastructure allows us to scale our efforts across the platform. Since the Etsy marketplace\u2019s migration to Google Cloud, completed in 2020, we\u2019ve increased engineering efficiency, shifting the focus from maintaining on-premise systems to product engineering work that is more strategic. This cloud migration has enabled us to dynamically flex our infrastructure capacity, while providing faster processing speed, improved page load time, and more nimble technology on an as needed basis depending on traffic volume. In 2022, we invested in our technology platform to improve engineering development efficiencies and increase our product development velocity. Our other marketplaces Reverb, Depop, and Elo7 also operate their marketplaces in the cloud and make similar technical development investments with Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d). Product Development Etsy\u2019s product development and engineering organization is built around the core belief that we can create connections between our sellers and buyers that are personal and fundamentally different from those in other places you can shop or sell. We believe we have a novel approach to product development, which we call our Product Development Culture, an evolving set of key principles, mindsets, and habits that guide how our teams work, experiment, and interact as we develop great experiences for our customers and business. Our teams are organized around a collection of initiatives that support a common strategy aligned with our \u201cRight to Win,\u201d with cross-functional teams focused on a single key performance indicator (\u201cKPI\u201d) and set of objectives and key results, all meant to solve key customer friction points. Product and engineering groups work across all areas that matter to our buyers and sellers - the core buyer and seller experience, search and ads, payments, fulfillment, member support, and more. Our approach to solving customer challenges includes deep research, A/B testing, exploratory analysis, product management, design, engineering, and product marketing (go-to-market strategies).  We continue to advance our \u201cRight to Win\u201d strategy, our playbook designed to ensure Etsy is the first stop for consumers who want to shop their tastes and values, as well as differentiating our value proposition in a competitive environment. In 2022, we targeted our investments to making Etsy feel more \u201cmade for you\u201d by improving the efficiency and inspiration of our Search & Discovery, making Etsy more reliable as a Trusted Brand, and providing our sellers with increased agency and scalability tools to help grow their businesses.  8 8  8 Table of Contents Table of Contents The chart below highlights just a few of our key product development achievements in 2022: Etsy also shares aspects of its product development culture and strategies with our other subsidiaries. We are early in this effort and believe that over time increased focus on experimentation, search and discovery, and fulfillment will improve the customer experience across all of our marketplaces. Marketing We believe that our approach to investments in marketing are somewhat different from some other players in e-commerce, and we continue to evolve and refine these activities as a core component of our business. We\u2019ve evolved our marketing strategy to reinforce our core brand promise in the minds of Etsy buyers, and we\u2019ve strengthened our capabilities by employing a full-funnel marketing approach, optimizing our investments in each area of the funnel. Our two primary types of marketing investments, performance and brand - where we spent approximately $433\u00a0million and $145\u00a0million, respectively on a consolidated basis in 2022 - are discussed below: Performance marketing. In 2022, the percentage of GMS attributed to performance marketing (paid GMS) was 20% so the vast majority of our GMS comes to us organically through awareness of our brand. Our investments in performance marketing, which we define as paid media spend related to the digital acquisition and re-engagement of buyers, adjusts according to demand and scale based on incremental return. We do not set fixed budgets for our marketing team; our investment philosophy for performance marketing is to invest until the marginal return on investment (\u201cROI\u201d) on the next dollar spent is below our target minimum ROI. Increases in buyer lifetime value (\u201cLTV\u201d), driven by visits, conversion rate, incremental revenue, and frequency, shift the return curve, enabling us to spend more in marketing. The vast majority of return comes in-period, although some does fall into subsequent quarters. Our performance marketing spend naturally adjusts with demand, which we believe has worked well for us through changing demand and pricing for third-party marketing channels. In May 2020, we launched our innovative advertising program for Etsy marketplace sellers called Offsite Ads. In this offering, Etsy pays the upfront costs to promote Etsy sellers\u2019 listings on multiple internet platforms, and sellers only pay an additional transaction fee when they make a sale. When a shopper clicks on an offsite ad featuring a seller\u2019s listing and purchases from the seller\u2019s shop within 30 days of that click, the seller pays Etsy a transaction fee on that order. We believe our Offsite Ads program is a win-win for Etsy and our sellers because sellers only pay a fee when they make a sale and the additional fee expands Etsy\u2019s LTV, as outlined above, enabling us to spend deeper to drive more visits to our marketplace. In 2022, revenue from the Etsy marketplace\u2019s Offsite Ads program offset approximately 32% of our consolidated performance marketing spend. Brand marketing. Since 2018, Etsy has leaned more heavily into \u201cupper funnel\u201d brand marketing strategies through TV, digital video, and paid social, to create a flywheel designed to elevate the effectiveness of our other marketing channels. Etsy continuously surveys buyers on \u2018brand funnel\u2019 metrics such as awareness and loyalty, and, in 2022, we refreshed the questions asked in these surveys to better track the results of our investments. U.S. Etsy buyer surveys indicate that, since the fourth quarter of 2018, prompted awareness is up more than 10%, purchase intent grew over 100%, and visit intent increased over 70%. We are also seeing great movement in our brand funnel metrics in the United Kingdom and Germany. Since the fourth quarter of 2020, our prompted awareness in the United Kingdom is up over 15% and purchase intent is up over 10%. During the same period in Germany, prompted awareness increased nearly 100% and purchase intent grew nearly 90%. Given these healthy performance metrics, as well as our validation of performance through multiple third-party methodologies, we anticipate that upper funnel brand marketing strategies will continue to be a growing part of our marketing investment mix over time.  Other marketing activities. Our marketing strategy also includes sophisticated Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools that enable us to segment and target our buyers for engagement on and off Etsy, \u201cmid funnel\u201d advertising such as on social media channels, and corporate marketing partnerships to target specific buyer demographics. For example, we saw a 92% increase in video views on our social channels in 2022. We also build our brand globally through earned media that features Etsy as a trend-setter and global destination for conscious shopping that supports small business.  9 9  9 Table of Contents Table of Contents We believe our CRM and app push notifications are efficient tools to drive engagement with our active and lapsed buyers. In 2022, we leveraged these capabilities to promote seller \u201cThank You\u201d coupon email reminders, offers for buyers\u2019 recently favorited items, select flash sales on our app, abandoned cart reminders, as well as redesigned post-purchase \u201cconvos\u201d to drive buyer re-engagement and frequency. We also added email opt-in at checkout for international buyers, provided an automated app download offer, and further improved update banners that bring buyers back. We expanded social marketing activities with our \u201cCreator Collab\u201d program that encourages co-created content and product to drive traffic to Etsy by allowing creators to monetize certain social media content through our affiliate marketing channels. As part of this program, Etsy and our sellers partner with celebrities and influencers who are passionate about Etsy to reach new buyers and drive engagement with existing buyers.  Our subsidiaries are less mature businesses than Etsy.com and have therefore not yet reached the necessary size to cost-effectively scale either performance or brand marketing. We see further opportunity following early collaborations to share expertise through projects and personnel across our brands. We believe increased collaboration has the potential to drive future growth. Trust & Safety The trustworthiness of our marketplaces and the connections among people in our community are cornerstones of our business. Our policies are designed to encourage transparency among our members by clearly outlining the rights and responsibilities of sellers and buyers participating on our platform. On Etsy.com we strive to give the Etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing goods from a shop that adheres to certain standards, which starts with our policies. Fundamentally, we require that goods listed on Etsy be handmade (whether by the seller alone or with the help of a production partner), vintage, or craft supplies. Etsy is an unjuried marketplace, meaning sellers run their own shops, create, sell, and ship their own products, and are responsible for complying with our robust Seller Policy. Items on Etsy do not have barcodes or SKUs, and Etsy does not ever touch or possess the items for sale on our marketplace. The unique nature of Etsy sellers\u2019 product inventory, combined with the constantly evolving nature of policy interpretation, necessitates expert, human involvement in content moderation, which we combine with the power of cutting-edge tools and technology. Our teams continuously re-evaluate content on Etsy.com in the context of emerging trends to determine whether such content violates our House Rules or terms of use, including our Prohibited Items policy. Etsy.com has a zero tolerance approach for items that promote, support, or glorify hate or violence or that perpetuate the spread of harmful misinformation. Beyond prohibited content detection and removal, we have grounded our content moderation program and product roadmap in ensuring that buyers can trust their experience and have the information they need to make informed purchase decisions, and that sellers can understand what is required of them, including whether their listing is permitted under our policies. We remain committed to ensuring that any member can easily alert Etsy about potential violations of our policies. We have also taken steps to ensure that Etsy sellers are positioned for success by making our policies easy to understand, refining our violation notification process, and providing resources to help sellers when they have compliance questions.  As the Etsy marketplace has experienced significant growth over the last few years, we have increased our investments and resources dedicated to trust and safety. This includes scaling our teams and investing in new tools and advanced technologies to enable these teams to more effectively and efficiently do their jobs. This included growing our content moderation team, expanding our handmade and counterfeit team dedicated to fighting counterfeits and violations of our Handmade Policy, and creating a dedicated trust and safety machine learning engineering team. Another example of a Trust & Safety enhancement is our new Reporting Portal, introduced in 2022, which has enabled thousands of intellectual property and other proprietary rights holders to report issues. In 2022, we expanded enforcement of our Handmade Policy to continue to protect the integrity of our marketplace and increased our proactive review of listings for potential handmade violations. In order to protect our brand and our sellers\u2019 collection of unique items, we will continue building on our proactive moderation capabilities while providing sellers with new tools to accurately describe their items and stay policy-adherent.  We publish an annual Transparency Report, which details our policy enforcement for the year on Intellectual Property, Prohibited Items, and Requests for Member Information policies. We have shared this report on our corporate website annually since 2015 and believe that publicly reporting on our enforcement efforts builds trust in our marketplace and community. Our subsidiaries \u2013 Depop, Reverb, and Elo7 \u2013 also care about running trustworthy marketplaces, and maintain robust community guidelines and prohibited items policies. In 2022, there was significant sharing of best-practices and information on these important items across our \u201cHouse of Brands.\u201d As one example of improvements within our other marketplaces, Depop stepped up fraud detection and prevention activities through the implementation of a new third-party tool and expanded its fraud prevention team. You can read more about our other marketplaces\u2019 respective policies and procedures by visiting each of their marketplace websites. 10 10  10 Table of Contents Table of Contents Member Support As the Etsy marketplace has scaled, so have our investments in member support. While the majority of issues are resolved directly between our customers, we jump in and work to help resolve problems quickly when needed. As the primary touch point for our vibrant community of buyers and sellers, our Member Services team serves as both the voice of the Etsy brand and an important advocate for our community. When an issue arises, or a user has a question, we want to ensure they get support quickly and easily.  In 2022 we expanded our Member Services team to improve our case management process and continued to enhance our self-service and seller education tools to quickly resolve issues without our intervention. Here are some specific examples of 2022 enhancements: \u2022We expanded our Member Services team and trained hundreds of agents in Etsy Purchase Protection workflows ahead of the August 2022 launch, allowing us to meaningfully reduce the time to resolve case complaints despite the increase in submissions. Etsy Purchase Protection protects sellers and buyers on qualifying orders up to $250 when an item does not match the description, arrives damaged, or never arrives. \u2022We improved and expanded our live chat support, which is an increasingly preferred option for many Etsy users. For example, we launched Shop Manager Chat, a higher level of support provided to top sellers. Our subsidiaries also require similar member support activities, and we believe our experience can be leveraged across our subsidiaries to help drive their future growth and customer satisfaction. Seller Investments  In addition to our Offsite Ads advertising program and our paid services which include Etsy Ads, our on-site advertising platform for sellers, and our shipping labels product, we provide a wide range of insights, tools, programs, and educational resources to give Etsy marketplace sellers the support they need to manage and grow their businesses. Here are some examples: \u2022Star Seller program: We expanded on our successful Star Seller program, which celebrates and rewards sellers who provide excellent customer service with badging and increased prominence. The Star Seller program continued to gain traction, with a 75% increase year-over-year in sellers with a badge as of December 31, 2022. Star Sellers also earned approximately 15% more GMS than their non-Star Seller counterparts in 2022 due to factors such as higher conversion rate, traffic, average order value, and orders per converting buyer. \u2022Seller Services and Tools:  \u25e6We offer a variety of free tools to Etsy sellers, including our Shop Manager dashboard, which serves as a centralized hub for Etsy sellers to track orders, manage inventory, view metrics and statistics, and have conversations with their customers across all of their Etsy shops. This dashboard is a single, easy-to-use interface that streamlines sellers\u2019 bills and payments accounts.  \u25e6We fully launched a new Etsy Seller App to all sellers, which includes features such as the ability to more easily manage inventory and check order status, receive notifications about repeat customers, add photos and listing videos, and purchase and print shipping labels. We continue to add features based on our seller feedback. \u25e6As part of our Etsy Purchase Protection program, as described above, Etsy refunds buyers and allows sellers to keep their earnings on qualifying orders if a buyer never receives the package, or the item arrives damaged, providing our sellers with more support in the event that something goes wrong.  \u25e6We expanded our Help Center and improved navigation functionality, making it easier for sellers to access articles and content to better manage their accounts, find answers to their questions, and self-service minor issues that may arise. We also added 24/7 chat to support sellers. \u2022Education: We provide extensive educational resources to teach Etsy sellers how to start, manage, and scale their businesses on our platform, including: \u25e6Blog posts, video tutorials, the Etsy Seller Handbook (available on Etsy.com), Etsy.com online forums, and insights from our support teams. Leveraging seller feedback, we redesigned the Etsy Seller Handbook homepage, introducing a new top navigation tool to highlight key resources and popular content.  11 11  11 Table of Contents Table of Contents \u25e6In September 2022, we held Etsy Up: Holiday Edition, our first-ever global holiday kickoff event for sellers around the world. The interactive online experience included insider access to trends, tools, and actionable takeaways to help grow our sellers\u2019 shops. This virtual event drew 80,000 sellers, making it the largest ever seller gathering in our history. \u25e6We added a personalized Offsite Ads performance snapshot email that details key metrics and messaging. This report provides our sellers with a clear view of the value of our Offsite Ads program. \u25e6Etsy sellers also connect through self-organized Etsy Teams to build personal relationships with other Etsy sellers, collaborate, educate, and support each other as they build their independent creative businesses.  Our subsidiaries also offer many tools and services for their seller communities, including tips for success, pricing insights, community events, and shipping carrier relationships and support. 12 12  12  Table of Contents Table of Contents The Etsy Marketplace: Our Passionate and Engaged\u00a0Community Over the past few years, Etsy\u2019s investments in our growth strategy and business drivers, as well as external factors that drove dramatic changes to the way people engage with e-commerce marketplaces in general and with the Etsy marketplace in particular, have led to significant changes in engagement and retention of our seller and buyer communities. This section outlines characteristics of the Etsy marketplace seller and buyer cohorts, which we believe is a useful barometer to track our performance over time. Etsy Sellers We believe that our 5.4 million active sellers are the backbone of Etsy\u2019s business and that what matters most to them is our community of approximately 89 million buyers. We serve creative artisans and entrepreneurs around the world who choose to pursue their passions, offering them excellent value compared with other channels they may have to sell their products, and a cohesive suite of powerful tools and services to help them run their business and drive sales. Etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional merchants and have a broad range of personal and professional goals.  In 2022, active sellers, those who sold an item or incurred a bill charge in the last 12 months, grew 2% compared to 2021 and 114% compared to 2019. Our number of active sellers grew at a 27% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2018. Our sellers\u2019 success can be measured by trailing twelve-month GMS per active seller, which decreased approximately 6% year-over-year to $2,169 in 2022, yet grew when compared to the pre-pandemic period, up 16% from 2019. About Etsy Sellers  Etsy is an on-ramp to entrepreneurship and economic empowerment for many people who might not have otherwise started a business. Here are some highlights of our November 2022 seller census1: Seller\u2019s creative businesses help build resilience for sellers and their families. \u2022For 34%, their creative business (on and off Etsy) is their sole occupation.  \u2022Their creative business provides an important source of supplemental income contributing 12% of household income, on average.  \u20225 in 10 have financial dependents, including 29% who have children under 18 at home.  \u202244% use income from their creative business to cover household expenses like bills, rent, and food.  1 Global Methodology: Etsy sellers with an active shop in all of our core markets with the exception of Australia (United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada and India) were randomly selected to take part in a 25 minute online survey between November 9, 2022 and November 23, 2022. The survey and data analysis of the results were conducted by Ipsos, a leading Research and Public Opinion firm, in partnership with Etsy. Historically Etsy provided country specific data in its seller census. Given general similarity in our seller community survey results across countries we are no longer providing this level of detail. The total global sample size was 8,118 sellers. Results were weighted to represent Etsy\u2019s global footprint and seller population parameters. The margin of error for the global survey is +/- 1.5%, but may vary per question.  13 13  13 Table of Contents Table of Contents Etsy businesses support local communities and the broader economy. \u2022The vast majority (90%) source supplies domestically.  \u202236% of sellers export their goods outside their home country.  Creative entrepreneurs continue turning to Etsy for financial stability. \u202261% of all sellers cite financial challenges as prompting them to start their creative businesses. Of those, 69% said that financial challenge was the rising cost of living or inflation.  \u20221 in 4 sellers say their business has helped them offset the rising cost of living, and 36% of sellers in business for more than a year say their Etsy income is more important now than a year ago.  Etsy sellers help us understand broader economic trends. \u2022They are emblematic of the changing nature of work: 57% work independently2, and only 32% have full-time employment.

The above tables show two different views of the same data. Each new seller cohort includes the aggregate GMS from all sellers that created and were billed for their first listing on Etsy.com in the designated year - the table on the left shows retention as a percentage of \u201cYear 1\u201d GMS and the one on the right shows retention in dollars. The GMS for each seller is calculated from the date of their first listing fee such that \u201cYear 1\u201d represents the GMS received by all sellers in the cohort within 365 days of their first listing fee. As a result, we do not yet have a full \u201cYear 2\u201d data set for the 2021 new seller cohort, as sellers who incurred their first listing fee later in 2021 have not yet had two years to age. These tables show that all seller cohorts initially inflected positively in terms of GMS value sold on the Etsy marketplace during the pandemic, and that seller cohorts are retaining much of the gains achieved despite the significant macroeconomic and reopening headwinds Etsy and other e-commerce marketplaces faced in 2022. That said, as pandemic periods roll out of future periods we could see further degradation of cohort retention.  Etsy Buyers The Etsy marketplace supports a community of approximately 89 million buyers, who are looking to buy unique items directly from creative artisans and entrepreneurs. Etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and build relationships through direct interactions with Etsy sellers. They can also purchase customized items, vintage merchandise, and craft supplies from Etsy sellers. By shopping on the Etsy marketplace, Etsy buyers are supporting creative artisans and entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world. We are focused on driving more new buyers to the platform and driving engagement so they purchase more often. The COVID-19 pandemic and other global macroeconomic factors were catalysts for significant change in how buyers engage with Etsy.com. Here we provide detail supporting our belief that we have been able to retain much of the positive impact we\u2019ve seen from the dramatic adoption of e-commerce in 2020 and 2021.

Since a buyer is separately identified by a unique e-mail address, a buyer is considered new if they use a unique e-mail address that has never been used for a purchase on the Etsy marketplace. During 2022, we had over 29 million new Etsy.com buyers, down 16% compared to 2021.

The dramatic increase in active buyers during the pandemic also resulted in more lapsed buyers in recent periods than in pre-pandemic periods, providing Etsy with opportunity to reactivate a much larger pool of recently lapsed buyers. As a result of focus on this opportunity, we reactivated our highest ever number of lapsed buyers - 24\u00a0million in 2022, an increase of 24% from 2021, and up 87% from 2019.

Repeat Buyers: Repeat Etsy buyers represent shoppers who made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months. We believe repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of Etsy buyers. In 2022, on the Etsy marketplace, approximately 48% of our active buyers were repeat buyers, largely in line with the approximately 49% in 2021. While in 2022 the average number of purchase days per year that repeat buyers purchased decreased slightly from 2021 as we encountered reopening headwinds, this metric has trended higher over the past few years (from 4.6 times per year in 2019 to 5.1 times per year in 2022). We believe that we have significant opportunity to continue to drive frequency, a challenging metric to move, by improving the buyer journey through our ongoing investments in inspiration, efficiency, and reliability.

We have been particularly focused on converting our repeat buyers into habitual buyers, or Etsy buyers who have spent $200 or more and made purchases on six or more days in the previous 12 months. Habitual buyers were 8% of our active buyers yet represented approximately 44% of our 2022 GMS. While we saw a 9% decline in habitual buyers in 2022 given the headwinds outlined above, we believe we have significant opportunities to re-accelerate growth in this buyer type as we continue to invest in our \u201cRight to Win\u201d strategy.

The COVID-19 pandemic drastically shifted behavior for buyers around the globe, which led to a surge in e-commerce and accelerated digital transformation in 2020 and 2021. In February of 2022, the world began to take material strides in increasing mobility and nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels by May 2022, which provided consumers with many more choices for where to spend their time and money. Looking forward, we believe that the lines between online and offline shopping are blurring for many consumers, and that Etsy has the opportunity to gain share within the context of the broader retail marketplace. We expect that our future success hinges on our ability to execute on the growth strategies outlined above, bringing more buyers to the marketplace, driving frequency of purchasing and the amount of spend on Etsy. Etsy Marketplace Opportunity In a market opportunity analysis completed in 2021, we estimated that the online market size across all relevant retail categories for the Etsy marketplace within our seven core geographic markets represented a $466 billion market opportunity, and an approximately $2.0 trillion market opportunity when offline was included. Included in this analysis of \u201crelevant retail categories\u201d was apparel and footwear, beauty and personal care, home and living, craft supplies, paper and party, art and collectibles, personal accessories and eyewear, pet care, and toys and games. Our 2022 Etsy marketplace GMS only represented approximately 2.5% of that online only portion.  We continue to focus on our goal of growing at a faster rate than e-commerce, on average and over time, and on gaining share through further penetration of certain categories and driving frequency of purchases on Etsy from existing and new buyers. We believe that the total number of days per year buyers purchase on Etsy continues to lag the total purchase days per year patterns for some of our key competitors. We believe Etsy has significant opportunities to capture more buyers around the world, with room to grow with our core female buyers, increasing opportunity to make Etsy relevant for people who identify as men, and further penetration in our most mature markets as well as in our lesser penetrated regions. Since our analysis is focused on our core geographies and retail categories, additional upside to this opportunity could come from further geographic and/or category expansion for Etsy.com. \u201cHouse of Brands\u201d Opportunity  Since 2019, Etsy has taken several important strategic actions that deepen or enhance our total market opportunity. These include: our purchases of Reverb (musical instruments), Depop (expanding our apparel category opportunity into the resale sector), and Elo7 (which brings Etsy into the Brazilian e-commerce market). Third-party data on each brands\u2019 market opportunity is provided on pages 6-7 above. 19 19  19  Table of Contents Table of Contents Competition For all of our marketplaces, sellers may choose to list their goods for sale with online retailers or sell their goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces, including through commerce channels on social networks like Facebook and Instagram. They may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers, including large national retailers, who discover their goods in our marketplaces or otherwise. We also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses, enabling sellers to sell from their own website or otherwise run their business independently of our platforms. We are able to compete for sellers based on our brand awareness, the global scale of our marketplaces and the breadth of our online presence, our meaningful investments in marketing that benefit our sellers and their growth, the number and engagement of our buyers, our seller tools and services, our seller education resources, our policies and fees, our mobile apps, the strength of our community, and our values. We also compete with retailers of all shapes and sizes for the attention of our buyers. A buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer, whether large marketplaces, national retail chains, local consignment and vintage stores, resale marketplaces, or other venues or marketplaces. We are able to compete for buyers based on the unique goods that sellers list in our marketplaces, our brand awareness, the person-to-person commerce experience, customer service, our reputation for trustworthiness, the positive impact buyers can make by shopping from the creative entrepreneurs on our platform, our mobile apps, the availability of fair and free shipping offered by sellers, ease of payment, and the availability and reliability of our platform.  Intellectual Property Protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, in the United States and abroad. We also use confidentiality procedures, defensive licensing and acquisitions, non-disclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights to protect us and our intellectual property. We file patents and register domain names, trademarks, copyrights, and service marks in the United States and abroad. We rely upon unregistered copyrights and common law protection for certain trademarks. We also use internal and external brand protection mechanisms that are intended to protect our brands from misuse by third parties.   Government Regulation As with any company operating on the internet, we are subject to a growing number of local, national, and international laws and regulations. These laws are often complex, sometimes contradict other laws, and are frequently changing. Compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant amounts of management time and focus. In addition, in both the United States and abroad, laws and regulations relating to the liability of online marketplaces for activities of their sellers and other third parties are being tested by a number of proceedings.   Laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world, posing a significant challenge to our global business. For example, federal and state laws in the United States, E.U. directives, and other national laws govern the processing of payments and consumer protection; other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices. Still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected. Laws of defamation apply online and vary by country.   We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of consumer information. Our privacy policies describe our practices concerning the use, storage, transmission and disclosure of personal information, including buyer and seller data. Any failure by us to comply with our policies or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business.   Many jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted laws and regulations requiring notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. This growing focus on data privacy and regulation of e-commerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on sellers and could subject us to significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect the privacy and data of our sellers and buyers could result in a loss of confidence in our marketplaces, which could adversely affect our business.  In addition, some of these requirements may introduce friction into the buying and selling experience on our platforms and may impact the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, which could negatively impact our business and future outlook. Additionally, because we operate internationally, we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the United States, including anti-money laundering, sanctions, anti-corruption, and export control laws. Non-compliance with any applicable laws and regulations could result in penalties or significant legal liability. See Part I, Item IA, \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Regulatory, Compliance, and Legal Risks.\u201d 20 20  20  Table of Contents Table of Contents Seasonality Etsy.com sellers experience increased sales and use more Etsy services during the fourth-quarter holiday shopping season. This has resulted in increased GMS and revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Our cost of revenue and marketing expenses also generally follow this trend, with the highest costs incurred in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We expect this seasonality to continue in future years.    ESG Reporting: Our Impact Goals, Strategy & Progress We have developed an Impact strategy and goals that reflect the positive impact we want to have on the world while advancing and complementing our business strategy, and we are pleased to provide this update on our progress. Our Approach to ESG Reporting: We apply similar focus, discipline, and accountability to our environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) reporting metrics as we do our financial metrics, and we believe that together they make us stronger and more resilient. We expect to continue to use our required filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), as well as our Investor Relations website and Etsy News blog, as our primary communications channels for information relating to our Impact strategy and progress. We have various approaches for determining what information we disclose in our ESG reporting, including feedback we receive from the financial community and other stakeholders. In addition, we continue to report our ESG metrics using the relevant Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\u201cSASB\u201d) sector standards for our industry and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) frameworks. Our \u201cHouse of Brands\u201d and ESG Reporting Boundary: We expect to continue to evolve our Impact strategy and ESG reporting in the future as we grow and further incorporate our recently acquired marketplaces into our Impact strategy and as our Impact work continues to mature. Our discussion of Impact strategy and highlights and ESG data includes the operations of our Etsy.com, Reverb, and Depop marketplaces but does not include the operations of Elo7, which was acquired in 2021, except where designated in the below chart. It is our intention to further integrate our Elo7 marketplace in our ESG reporting in the future.

Creating Economic Impact Through Entrepreneurship We are committed to growing sustainably by aligning our mission and business strategy to help create economic impact through entrepreneurship and, therefore, create value for all our stakeholders. In 2022, Etsy.com sellers contributed almost $13.5\u00a0billion to the U.S. economy* by harnessing their creativity and bringing unique products to market. Etsy.com sellers created the equivalent of nearly 3.4 million jobs in the independent worker economy*, enough jobs to employ all of the city of Chicago (population 2.7 million) and more, and generated approximately $3.6 billion in income*. *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To calculate these results, Etsy.com commissioned its fifth economic impact study with ECONorthwest, an independent economic consulting firm, to explore the ways Etsy.com sellers in the United States contribute to the national economic landscape.            22 22  22 Table of Contents Table of Contents How We Drive Impact Underpinning our Impact strategy is a set of levers we employ to drive toward our Impact goals while advancing and complementing our business strategy.  In 2022, Etsy Inc.\u2019s Advocacy team worked with sellers and policymakers around the world to ensure a voice for small business owners in public policy. We continued to advocate for public policies aligned with the needs of creative entrepreneurs including\u00a0supporting:\u2022reform efforts to provide the U.S. postal service with the funds needed to provide accessible affordable shipping options for\u00a0sellers;\u2022enhanced access to affordable child care and caregiving leave for micro businesses;\u2022sellers\u2019 privacy rights by advocating for strong privacy protections in consumer protection bills; and\u2022the rights of small business owners by advocating against new rules that would impose heavy burdens on small and\u00a0microbusinesses.Impact Investing.

This extended to Ukraine-based sellers in our relevant marketplaces, including Etsy.com and Reverb. This represented a contribution of approximately $4.6 million towards our community.Natural disasters can be devastating to our sellers. In 2022, we updated our Disaster Response Framework to guide how and when we proactively support sellers in times of crisis.Purchasing Power. We aim to drive positive impact in our supply chain by investing in strong relationships with our suppliers. We engage on priority impact areas, such as supplier diversity, greenhouse gas emissions, fair wages, and employee benefits programs, at crucial touch points throughout the supplier lifecycle. We conduct regular reviews, audits, and conversations to confirm suppliers are upholding agreed upon practices and to identify further areas where we can engage with suppliers.

We believe our Net Zero goal strengthens our position as a trusted brand and contributes to our long-term strategy and makes us more resilient, drives efficiencies, and prepares us for anticipated regulations. What\u2019s more, we believe the benefits of reducing emissions resonate beyond our corporate boundaries, contributing to the overall health of people and planet. In 2022, Etsy, Inc. became one of the first few hundred companies globally to have our Net Zero goal approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) under their new Net-Zero Standard. Guided by our new targets, in 2022, we reduced our absolute Scope 1 and 2 Net emissions by 12% while our Scope 3 emissions decreased by 22% on an intensity basis (tCO2e / $mm of gross profit) compared with our 2020 Net Zero baseline for both targets\u2020. We made the following progress towards our Net Zero goal in 2022: Transportation: Emissions from the shipping of items sold in our marketplaces is by far the largest source of our Scope 3 emissions. In 2022, emissions from transportation accounted for approximately 64% of our Scope 3 emissions. This represents a 17% intensity reduction relative to 2021 and 27% intensity reduction relative to our 2020 baseline. We drive reduction in transportation emissions primarily through advocacy, carrier engagement, and product (marketplace) design. In 2022, we supported the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act at the national level, and advocated for the Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Fleets legislation at the state level. Packaging:  In 2022, emissions related to our sellers\u2019 packaging made up 11% of our total Scope 3 footprint. This represents a 20% intensity reduction relative to 2021. Purchased Goods & Services:  Our 2022 corporate procurement emissions were 120,325 tCO2e or 23% of our Scope 3 emissions. Through direct supplier engagement and strict supplier selection criteria, we were able to reduce corporate procurement emissions 6% on an intensity basis relative to 2021. Through our supplier vetting program, we collected impact data from 77.7% of Etsy.com\u2019s suppliers, representing 89.7% of Etsy\u2019s supplier spend in 2022. Of suppliers who have provided information, we found that 55% of Etsy.com\u2019s spend went to companies that have set an emissions reduction goal. We plan to further leverage our negotiating power in our supply chain to drive Net Zero aligned reductions in 2023.  \u2020\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope 1 emissions include direct emissions such as natural gas and refrigerants used at our facilities. Scope 2 emissions include indirect emissions from the generation of electricity, steam, heating, and cooling that we may purchase for our facilities. Scope 3 emissions include all other indirect emissions that occur in our value chain such as business travel, employee commuting, and the goods and services we purchase. 24 24  24 Table of Contents Table of Contents Scope 3: Progress Against Science-Based Net Zero Target n\u00a0\u00a0Actual Emissions Intensity\u2014Yearly Target\u20142040 GoalScope of our Net Zero Goal: This includes emissions across all four brands within Etsy, Inc. and is set against a 2020 baseline.

Our consolidated \u201cHouse of Brands\u201d Scope 3 emissions intensity for the trailing three years are illustrated in the \u2018Progress Against Net Zero\u2019 adjacent chart.  Carbon Neutral Business We are focused on meeting our long-term SBTi- approved Net Zero goal. However, while we work toward long-term reductions in line with our goal, we are taking immediate action to address our environmental impact through our commitment to carbon neutrality. We consider our Net Zero efforts to be separate, but complementary to our carbon neutral work and expect to phase down our investments in offsets as we meet our Net Zero targets. Since 2019, we have offset 100% of Etsy.com and Reverb\u2019s Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. For 2022, we offset 100% of Etsy.com, Reverb and Depop\u2019s Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by investing in 532,009 verified emissions reductions (VERs) that protect forests, sponsor wind and solar farms, and help develop greener methods for producing auto parts. Sustainable Operations Maintain best-in-class sustainable operations. 2022 & 2023 GoalsSource 100% of electricity from renewable sources for all Etsy, Inc. brands.Achieve a 25% reduction in the intensity of our energy use in offices (kWh/sq. ft.) and for computing (kWh/visit) for Etsy.com by year end 2025.Maintain \u201cZero Waste\u201d across global operations for Etsy.com.

Achieve a 25% reduction in the intensity of our energy use in offices (kWh/sq. ft.) and for computing (kWh/visit) for Etsy.com by year end 2025.  Maintain \u201cZero Waste\u201d across global operations for Etsy.com. Run \u201cZero Waste\u201d operations at Reverb and Depop by year end 2025. Maintaining best-in-class sustainable operations allows us to focus on long-term cost reduction, minimizing waste, and creating a healthier office environment for our employees. In 2022, we continued to make good progress against our\u00a0goals.  Energy Use In 2022, our total operational energy footprint was 19,688 MWh, of which 52% was from electricity. This includes energy usage from our office facilities for Etsy.com, Reverb, and Depop, remote worker energy usage for Etsy.com, Reverb, and Depop, and our Google Cloud computing for Etsy.com. Using our Cloud Jewels methodology, we estimate our energy consumption from Google Cloud in 2022 to be 6,379 MWh, or 32% of our total energy use. Renewable Electricity Since 2020, we have sourced renewable energy for 100% of the electricity used to power Etsy.com and Reverb's offices and employees working from home, as well as Etsy.com's computing load in Google Cloud. For 2022, we also sourced renewable energy for 100% of the electricity used to power Depop's offices and employees working from home. 25 25  25 Table of Contents Table of Contents  This was achieved through a virtual power purchase agreement (\u201cVPPA\u201d), international renewable energy credits (iRECs), and on-site solar arrays at select offices. Through our 15-year VPPA, which we signed in 2018, we procure solar energy in the PJM Interconnection market that covers greater than 100% of Etsy, Inc.\u2019s U.S. electricity needs. Energy Efficiency Our 2022 energy use for Etsy.com offices was 4,001 MWh. In offices where we maintain operational control, we achieved a 35% reduction in energy intensity (kWh/sq. ft.) relative to our 2016 baseline. At our Brooklyn headquarters, our efforts led to a New York City Building Energy Grade of an A. For Etsy.com computing energy use, our energy usage per site visit (kWh/visit) decreased by 69% since 2016, largely due to our move to Google Cloud which has enabled us to dynamically flex our infrastructure capacity, while providing faster processing speed, improved page load time, and more nimble technology on an as needed basis depending on traffic volume. \u201cZero Waste\u201d In 2022, Etsy.com received a \u201cZero Waste\u201d certification of our operations through the Total Resource Use and Efficiency (\u201cTRUE\u201d) certification program by Green Business Certification Inc. (\u201cGBCI\u201d) for the fifth year in a row for diverting over 90% of waste from landfill at our Brooklyn and Dublin offices. We continue to work toward our \u201cZero Waste\u201d by 2025 goal for Reverb and Depop.

We believe prioritizing sustainability within our marketplaces creates an opportunity to drive strategic growth and ensure we are our communities\u2019 first stop when they want to shop according to the values that are most important to them. We\u2019re bringing sustainability to life for buyers and sellers in several ways: Item Sustainability In 2022, Etsy.com piloted new optional sustainability listing attributes that allow sellers to indicate if their items are made from environmentally conscious materials or are designed to be reusable or to reduce waste. On December 31, 2022, 4.7% of sellers had added a sustainability attribute to 1 or more listings, and 1.2% of active listings had at least one sustainability\u00a0attribute. As part of the launch, we also provided guidance to sellers on best practices for indicating each attribute. We are undertaking an\u00a0internal review of a sample of listings to identify opportunities to enhance education. We are also engaging an external sustainability firm to review the efficacy of the program and determine if any remediation measures are needed in advance of\u00a0launching any buyer-facing initiatives. Packaging  As part of our efforts to meet our Net Zero goal, we are helping sellers reduce emissions from the packaging they use to ship orders, through both reused packaging and more sustainable options. In 2022, we expanded our partnership with EcoEnclose to include both  26 26  26 Table of Contents Table of Contents Etsy.com and Depop sellers in the United States. Through the partnership, sellers can access and buy affordable packaging made from certified responsibly sourced and 100% recycled paper that buyers can also recycle easily at home. The program now also supports sellers who reuse existing packaging, through a reused packaging sticker option.  Circularity  In 2022, we set a new strategy to inspire and enable people to participate in the circular economy where products and resources remain in use at their highest value across our marketplaces. Across our marketplaces, our communities are participating in circular systems, from the creative materials they use, to the items they sell, to the packaging they use to ship.   SocialEnsuring equitable access to opportunity  Prioritizing People As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had approximately 2,790 total employees worldwide, inclusive of Reverb, Depop, and Elo7 which had approximately 270 employees, 390 employees, and 220 employees, respectively. Diversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) are core to Etsy\u2018s culture. As Etsy has grown, we have leaned on our value of \u201cembracing differences.\u201d We\u2019ve continued our commitment to creating safe-space communities through our Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERGs\u201d), made improvements to increase employee accessibility and disability inclusion, and refreshed our competency matrices and our performance enablement programs to enable equity.  This year we took to heart that diverse teams thrive with inclusive leadership, benefits, and policies. We believe that diverse and inclusive teams build more creative and innovative solutions that strengthen our business and reinforce our values. We\u2019re committed to building a workplace where people of all backgrounds and walks of life can thrive. Additionally, the sustainability of our working environment and employee well-being also remained a key priority.  As a result, we\u2019ve continued to support our hybrid working mode, as we believe a hybrid approach to work is the best fit for our business, culture, and team. We offer paid family leave policies, as well as periodic company-wide \u201crest and recharge\u201d days to supplement Etsy\u2019s generous paid time off policies. Etsy\u2019s employees also took advantage of regular Focus Days, full days where non-critical meetings are canceled and we focus on digging deep into individual work. Etsy also continues to offer mental health days to our employees as part of our overall approach to well-being. We continued our focus on employee engagement in 2022, which is linked with high performance, retention, innovation, and growth. Our employees have chosen to work at Etsy because they believe in our action-oriented, values-based, and purpose-driven work culture. In 2022, we conducted an engagement survey of all Etsy.com and Reverb global employees. Of all employees surveyed across Etsy.com and Reverb, 87% submitted a response. 77% of Etsy.com respondents and 75% of Reverb respondents reported favorable employee\u00a0engagement. 27 27  27 Table of Contents Table of Contents Employee Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Build diverse and inclusive work forces that are broadly representative of their communities. 2022 Goals2023 GoalsEtsy.com: Approximately double\u00a0the percentage of\u00a0U.S. employees at Etsy.com who identify as Black, Latinx, or Native American by year\u00a0end 2023.For Mexico and Ireland-based Software Engineering teams, achieve approximately two\u00a0times country-level\u00a0gender representation benchmark for\u00a0women\u00a0and\u00a0marginalized genders by year end 2027.\u2022Mexico target: 13%\u2022Ireland target: 16%Reverb: Reach gender parity at\u00a0Reverb by year end 2026 (increasing women and marginalized genders to at least 50% by year end 2026).Approximately double\u00a0the percentage of\u00a0U.S. employees at Reverb who identify as\u00a0BIPOC by year end 2026.Enhance and expand accessibility efforts by defining a KPI and\u00a0establishing a\u00a0baseline for\u00a0accessibility in the employee experience at Etsy.com, Reverb, and Depop.

Achieve 27% of underrepresented gender identities in engineering & data by year end 2028 (baseline December 31, 2022: 20%) Employee DEI We made progress on the goal we set in 2018 to double the percentage of Black, Latinx, and Native American (collectively called \u201cunderrepresented communities\u201d or \u201cURC\u201d) employees at Etsy.com by year end 2023. In 2022, Black, Latinx and Native American people constituted 23.9% of U.S. Etsy.com hires. As a result, at December 31, 2022, Black, Latinx, and Native American people made up 15.3% of Etsy.com's U.S. workforce, up from 8.6% in 2018 and 12.9% in 2021.  In 2022, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (\u201cBIPOC\u201d) constituted 27.7% of Reverb\u2019s U.S. hires. At December 31, 2022, Reverb\u2019s U.S. workforce included 18.9% BIPOC representation, compared to 18.9% on December 31, 2021.  In 2022, Depop welcomed the integration within Etsy\u2019s \u201cHouse of Brands\u201d as an opportunity to build on prior efforts, and introduce refreshed employee DEI Goals which continue Depop\u2019s commitment to diversity while taking into account the wider economic context in which the business now operates, and more conservative hiring expected in 2023. Gender Diversity Etsy proudly maintains approximate gender parity in the overall employee population, among Leadership and at the Board of Directors level. We\u2019ve identified Software Engineering as an area for focus on improving gender diversity. In the U.S., the percentage of women and marginalized gender software engineers at Etsy.com is 37.9%. Globally across all functions, at Etsy.com, the representation of women and marginalized gender employees was 51% at year end 2022. We have identified an opportunity and set goals to increase representation of women and marginalized genders on Software Engineering teams in Mexico and Ireland by the end of 2027. As of December 31, 2022, in Mexico, we have achieved 14.4% representation of women and marginalized gender employees, and, in Ireland, we have achieved 16.2% representation of women and marginalized gender employees. At Reverb, the representation of women and marginalized gender employees grew from 33.9% at December 31, 2021 to 36.4% at December 31, 2022. 28 28  28 Table of Contents Table of Contents At Depop, the representation of women and marginalized gender employees was 46% of their global workforce at year end 2022. Although Depop\u2019s total workforce is broadly balanced between men and women/other gender identities, we\u2019ve identified that the engineering and data teams present an opportunity for improving gender diversity.  Depop has expanded the scope of their previously committed target for increasing the number of women in engineering and data positions to include women and other marginalized genders (referred to as underrepresented gender identities or,\u201dURGs\u201d). Attracting and Retaining Diverse Talent at the Leadership Level Etsy is committed to building a workplace where all people, regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or veteran status, can come, stay and thrive.  In 2022, Etsy formalized the Executive Diversity Council, bringing together senior stakeholders in order to support current and future DEI efforts and embed inclusive practices throughout Etsy.com, and holding leaders accountable for results. Members of this council are the Executive Team, who are responsible for Etsy\u2019s principal business units, and Etsy\u2019s DEI leaders. Etsy\u2019s Executive Diversity Council is working to support strategic initiatives, partnerships, advocacy, and programs that contribute to Etsy\u2019s DEI mission and Etsy\u2019s employee experience, and whose results can be measured against an established DEI scorecard.  As of December 31, 2022, Black, Latinx, and Native American people comprised 9.8% of Etsy and Reverb\u2019s combined leadership-level workforce. Our recruiting efforts include auditing each job description for inclusive language, proactively offering\u00a0disability accommodations, sourcing from wide talent pools, strict adherence to a structured interview process, diversity training for all interviewers, applying the Mansfield rule (requiring that at least two qualified candidates from underrepresented communities are included at the hiring manager screening or \u201consite\u201d stage (requirement varies by department) for all job openings to ensure candidates from underrepresented communities are included at the hiring manager screening or \u201consite\u201d stage (requirement varies by department)). To retain our employees, we\u2019re investing in refreshed management training through\u00a0Etsy\u2019s \u201cManaging in the Moment\u201d program, inclusion training for all employees, creating multiple avenues for connection and feedback between our Employee Resource Groups and our executive leaders; and we are seriously committed to\u00a0building trust and transparency with employees. For example, career development conversations generally take place quarterly at\u00a0Etsy and managers receive special training to facilitate annual review conversations and to mitigate potential biases in the\u00a0process. Focus on Inclusion At Etsy.com, we\u2019ve continued our mentorship programs and our employee resource group (\u201cERG\u201d) program. Our goal is to create a positive and inclusive workplace culture where employees from all backgrounds, ages, and abilities have access to programs that foster a sense of community, contribute to professional development, and amplify diverse voices within the organization. In 2022, Etsy.com grew our ERG program to ten communities by adding a resource group dedicated to Accessibility & Disability, created a series of roundtables where the ERGs held dialogs with executive leaders, and hosted a robust program of ERG-produced events focused on advocacy and equity. Etsy also continues to ensure our ERGs have a voice in Etsy.com\u2019s benefits offerings and responses to global concerns. In addition to our expanded ERG and mentorship offerings, in 2022 we launched identity-based peer cohorts, called \u2018dens\u2019 internally, for Black, Latinx, Native American and Asian identifying employees. In order to bolster equity and inclusion across Etsy\u2019s \u201cHouse of Brands,\u201d in 2022, Reverb hired a dedicated DEI leader, launched a DEI Leadership Council responsible for promoting collaboration, transparency, and accountability for achieving our DEI roadmap goals, and launched its first internal DEI mentorship program and ERG program. Our dedication to robust DEI training In addition to our annual anti-discrimination and anti-harassment trainings, Etsy.com and Reverb continued partnering with Praxis Labs to conclude a virtual reality based DEI course for all employees. This seven month long, self-paced learning journey was supported by monthly discussion sessions facilitated by the DEI team. Etsy.com and Reverb expect to continue to partner with third-party DEI consultants in 2023 as we continue to push our teams to \"walk the talk\" of our DEI commitments, and go beyond standard anti-discrimination trainings. In addition, we\u2019ll be embedding inclusion education into employee lifecycle moments, including new hire orientation and manager training. Our DEI development goals include advancing individual\u2019s ability to build empathy, identify inequity and, most importantly, take action. Depop is committed to launching inclusion training in 2023 for all employees, including managers.  Pay Equity Etsy takes proactive measures at each step of the employee journey in order to ensure fair pay practices. At the recruiting stage, we determine compensation packages within our existing frameworks by comparing outgoing offers to internal roles with comparable experience. During compensation reviews, we use guideposts when determining the size of merit and promotion increases and bonuses based on performance outcomes. Additionally, all compensation recommendations are reviewed by the appropriate Human Resources Business Partner and Executive team to ensure equity. Etsy also periodically makes market-based adjustments to compensation that we apply consistently within and across teams, to ensure pay for internal employees is aligned with that of new hires. 29 29  29 Table of Contents Table of Contents As part of our commitment to fair pay practices, we completed our 2022 Pay Equity analysis, conducted by a third-party consulting firm. The purpose of this analysis is to look at pay across jobs and levels to ensure our practices are fair and consistent and that compensation is not influenced by gender, or race/ethnicity. The analysis found no unexplained pay gaps adverse to women or employees from other marginalized genders, or non-white employees. Additionally, there were no unexplained pay gaps based on intersectionality (i.e., based on the combination of race and gender/ethnicity). We plan to continue to comprehensively audit pay equity biennially with an external consultant, and conduct internal reviews several times a year in conjunction with events such as rating and promotion decisions and market adjustments. Equity in Promotions Etsy\u2019s People Managers have the opportunity to recognize a direct report\u2019s significant contributions and readiness for the next level by nominating them for a promotion. We offer two promotion cycles per year, one in the fall and one in the spring. Each of these cycles includes a calibration step where senior leaders in the relevant internal organization meet to review all promotion nominations in that organization to ensure fairness in decision-making practices.  To help ensure fairness and to mitigate bias in assessing promotion readiness, we provide Managers with tools and training to reflect on their own implicit biases, and we solicit nominations through a structured nomination form that has been audited to incorporate DEI best practices.  In addition to our rigorous promotion nomination practices, we perform detailed pre- and post-calibration analyses to assess equity in each promotion cycle. Equity in Performance Ratings We reward and recognize employees for their performance at Etsy with an overall performance rating that is decided once per year in the Annual Review process and informs pay and talent decisions, including salary increases, bonuses, and promotion decisions.  We work hard to ensure the performance review process is as consistent and fair as possible. A number of components play key roles in minimizing bias including clearly established and accessible behavioral competencies that outline performance expectations for each role and level, performance ratings that weight impact (50%) and competencies (50%) equally, and calibration that is conducted annually following submission of a Self-Review and Manager Review. In calibration, senior leaders in the applicable internal organization meet to review all rating decisions to ensure fairness in how ratings are applied to individuals in similar levels and roles. We review data pre- and post-calibration to assess equity in performance rating decisions. We plan to continue conducting this analysis annually. Accessibility Ensuring our employees are supported by policies, tools, and benefits that fit their needs remains a top priority. We take a generous approach to providing employees with accommodations and leaves of absence when needed, and we work hard to reduce stigma related to discussing matters of disability and mental health. In 2022, Etsy.com launched the Accessibility & Disability ERG to foster community and provide a safe space for disabled and/or neurodivergent employees. In addition, we created an accommodations resource guide and trained our recruiters, as part of our efforts to ensure our interviewing process is as accessible as possible. We also are developing disability inclusion training, to be launched in 2023. In 2022, Etsy.com partnered with Disability:IN and participated in their Disability Equality Index, a comprehensive benchmarking tool that helps companies achieve disability inclusion and equity. Using Etsy\u2019s Disability Equality Index results, we built and began implementing a comprehensive disability inclusion roadmap.

In the final year of our work towards this target, we collected impact data through our supplier vetting program from 77.7% of Etsy\u2019s suppliers, representing 89.7% of Etsy\u2019s supplier spend in 2022. Of suppliers who have provided information, we found that 44.1% of Etsy\u2019s small- and medium-sized suppliers are owned by women, URCs*, or veterans, down from achieving our target of 50.1% in 2021. We hoped to sustain and build on this progress in 2022; however, in response to Etsy\u2019s rapid growth in scale, we saw two trends emerge that contributed to us missing the target.  1.In order to meet the demands of our larger scale, our business teams sought out efficiencies within their supply chains. Several business units planned and executed consolidation strategies across key spend categories (primarily professional services and in-office food). We focused our supplier diversity efforts on these planned areas of consolidation and encouraged the use of diverse small businesses wherever possible. We also engaged directly with our Tier 1 suppliers to support an expansion of data collection efforts to Tier 2 suppliers in our food program, where our purchasing power could have a more direct impact. Despite these efforts, the broader consolidation strategies in professional services contributed to the net reduction in supplier diversity. 2.At the same time, we also experienced accelerated growth in our overall small- and medium-sized supplier pool. While we are proud to have continued to grow our support of small- and medium-sized suppliers as our business scaled, we saw our overall small- and medium-sized supplier rate grow faster than our growth rate of diverse small- and medium-sized suppliers. *URC for supplier diversity is defined in the Supplier DEI 2023 Goals chart above. Launching a \u201cHouse of Brands\u201d Supplier Diversity Program and New Short-term Goal Since 2019, Etsy has scaled our corporate supply chain operations to support four brands and we\u2019ve learned that our supplier management and impact strategies have to evolve alongside our business. We began the crucial work of improving our end-to-end supplier management infrastructure in 2022 \u2013 adding people and centralizing processes; evolving our policies and processes to enable scale and efficiency; and introducing new technology. In 2023, we plan to continue these efforts and lay the foundation to launch Etsy\u2019s first ever \u201cHouse of Brands\u201d Supplier Diversity Program. In the coming years, we expect this program will allow us to add Depop to our supplier Impact vetting process (joining Etsy.com and Reverb suppliers), release a public-facing supplier diversity policy and invest in technology to support automated reporting and dashboards. As part of this program, we are introducing a new short-term target to achieve $120 million of cumulative spend with diverse suppliers from January 1, 2022 through the end of 2025, across Etsy.com, Reverb and Depop. As of the end of 2022, we had $27 million in diverse supplier spend toward our new target. Employment Practice Priorities  Etsy utilizes a number of vendors, contractors, and consultants, collectively our vendor partners, in the ordinary course of its business. These vendor partners are typically engaged to (a) enable Etsy to access otherwise unavailable expertise; (b) to fill short term staffing requirements (for example, temporary leave replacements); or (c) support our operations, including to deliver 24-hour multilingual customer support and trust and safety support coverage.  In 2022, we continued the meaningful work to educate our vendor partners who employ contractors on Etsy\u2019s aspirational guidelines for employment practices. We continued a process to survey and evaluate our third-party partners across key practices. Where we identify gaps, we open dialogues with our vendors, using these guidelines as a north star: \u2022Ensuring our contractors receive a progressive living wage, adjusted for market conditions, based on location.  \u2022Using our leverage with vendor partners to achieve a progressive and flexible paid leave policy for all full-time contractors, including vacation time, sick time, and gender-neutral parental leave.  \u2022Ensuring all full-time contractors have access to quality medical care for themselves and their dependents.  31 31  31 Table of Contents Table of Contents Creative Community Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Build Marketplaces that are Diverse, Welcoming and Inclusive Places to Sell and Shop, and Drive Equity within Creative Communities. 2022 Goals2023 GoalsMarketplace DEIEtsy.com: Build a welcoming marketplace that is diverse, inclusive, and broadly representative of the communities it\u00a0serves.Include at least\u00a045% Black and Brown skin tones in marketing assets in the United States and highlight historically marginalized groups.Social InnovationLeverage our marketplaces\u2019 platforms to drive equitable accessto creative pursuits and economic opportunity.

Depop: Aim to invest in programs or initiatives that drive equity for underrepresented communities on Depop.  In 2022, we consolidated our Marketplace DEI and Social Innovation goals under a single Creative Community DEI goal. We recognize that our efforts to create a welcoming and diverse marketplace for our buyers and sellers while supporting economically disenfranchised creative entrepreneurs must work in concert to drive our ultimate aim of equitable access to creative pursuits and economic opportunity. Marketplace DEI  In 2022, we worked to ensure that the images we proactively created and shared in our Etsy.com marketplace were broadly representative of the communities in which we live. In 2022, 47.9% of the people in marketing assets on Etsy.com-owned and Etsy.com-managed channels in the United States had black or brown skin tone representation or were identified as people of color. Social Innovation  This year represented another major expansion of Etsy\u2019s investments to increase pathways to creative entrepreneurship, especially for those from economically disenfranchised communities. Etsy understands the critical role creative entrepreneurship can play in building economic independence and freedom for communities and has long been committed to utilizing our marketplace to help anyone with a creative idea build a business online. This commitment was supported by Etsy.com\u2019s Uplift Initiative, a diverse set of programs focused on supporting creative entrepreneurs facing challenges such as lack of access to an internet connection or limited digital skills and capital to grow their businesses. Our Uplift Fund continued to support organizations helping creative entrepreneurs. In 2022, the fund received over 6.4 million contributions from U.S. buyers on the Etsy marketplace who elected to round-up their order price and donate their change. From these donations, the Uplift Fund distributed approximately $2.5 million in grants to organizations driving resources to creative entrepreneurs. The Uplift Makers program onboarded two new cohorts, enabling a growing number of heritage artisan communities to build pathways to economic independence by bringing their products online. Over $340,000 in sales was generated in 2022 by Uplift Maker shops.  And we supported our communities across the \u201cHouse of Brands:\u201d Reverb continues to drive resources to under-resourced communities globally through Reverb Gives and has provided access to musical equipment through over $250,000 in credits. Depop facilitated a new edition of the Now/Next program with six Black Sellers, each receiving a grant of $2,000. The program was focused on developing and curating a curriculum aimed at delivering tangible support for Black Sellers, providing them with the inspiration, knowledge, tools and access to accelerate their success on Depop. 32 32  32  Table of Contents Table of Contents Workforce Metrics Our mission is to \u201cKeep Commerce Human.\u201d Our DEI goals are integral to who we are as a company: namely, marketplaces and workplaces that are made stronger by the unique and special qualities of our communities.

Thoughtful Corporate Governance Our corporate governance practices include an independent Board Chair, a fully independent Board of Directors (except for our CEO), independent Committee members, sophisticated and fully engaged directors with different areas of relative expertise and additional dimensions of diversity, and a balanced distribution of director tenure. For a more complete description of our corporate governance practices, please refer to our Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (\u201cProxy Statement\u201d) to be filed with the SEC within 120 days of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. More information on our governance policies and guidelines is available at the Investor Relations section of our website. In 2022, we continued to evolve our corporate governance practices, amending our bylaws to provide that a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least three percent of the voting power of Etsy's outstanding capital stock continuously for at least three years, may nominate and include director nominees in Etsy\u2019s annual meeting proxy materials (commonly referred to as a \u201cproxy access bylaw\u201d), subject to certain limitations and requirements specified in the Bylaws.  We also strengthened our commitment to diversity on our Board of Directors, updating our Policies and Procedures for Director Candidates to require any initial list of director candidates considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to include at least two qualified candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity or gender. Integrated ESG Reporting We strive to continue to innovate and evolve our ESG disclosures to hold ourselves accountable and transparently engage with all of our stakeholders. Since 2018, we\u2019ve shared our ESG metrics alongside our financial results in our Integrated Annual Report. This practice is intended to ensure that we\u2019re transparent about and accountable for progress against our environmental and social goals. In 2022, we expanded the scope of our integrated ESG reporting to include Depop more broadly and to include Elo7 in our Gender and Age metrics for the first\u00a0time. We are also taking steps to improve our analysis and disclosure of human rights concerns, including publishing our Modern Slavery Statement and engaging with a human rights consultant to develop a roadmap to further improve our internal policies and processes to identify and address potential human rights risks. Risk Oversight and Management One of the key functions of our Board of Directors is to provide informed oversight of our risk management processes. While management is responsible for day-to-day management of the material risks we face, our Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight. Since 2019, Etsy has had a Risk Steering Committee, which consists of a cross-functional management team that meets regularly to review and discuss the significant risks facing Etsy. Periodic reports on material risk are provided to the full Board of Directors. The Risk Steering Committee also periodically considers areas of new or evolving risks and works to understand risk analyses and establish appropriate mitigation plans. For more information on risk oversight generally, please see \u201cBoard Oversight of Risk\u201d in Etsy\u2019s Proxy Statement.

In 2020, we expanded our inventory to account for the Scope 3 GHG emissions from: (1) the packaging our sellers use to ship products to buyers, (2) the use of our platforms on consumers\u2019 personal devices, and (3) our corporate supply chain. As part of our continued commitment to maintain accountability for our GHG emissions, in 2021, we further expanded the scope of our measured and reported GHG emissions inventory and refined the methodologies used to calculate our Scope 3 GHG emissions: (1) in Scope 3 - Category 3, we captured GHG emissions from fuel and energy related activities not already included in Scope 1 and 2, (2) we updated the supplier spend data, emission factors, and categorizations included in our Scope 3 - Category 1 emissions calculations, resulting in higher emissions year-over-year. (3) we reclassified emissions generated from Google Cloud computing from Scope 3 - Category 8 to Scope 3 - Category 1. As part of the recategorization of cloud computing, we now include an estimate of our supplier\u2019s Scope 3 emissions, resulting in higher emissions.

As part of our deepening management of climate impacts, since 2020, we have reported enhanced climate-related disclosures for Etsy.com in line with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d). The following section reflects our climate-specific reporting aligned with the TCFD. While we have identified and disclosed a number of relevant climate-related risks, we have determined that at this time none of these risks represent a material short-term risk to our business. For a discussion of certain risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities, see Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d TCFD provides a framework with four thematic areas \u2014 Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets \u2014 and eleven recommended disclosures. The following disclosures provide information intended to address each recommendation, including references to other publicly available sources for related information. Information in this section is limited to Etsy.com.  Governance Board of Directors oversight of climate-related risks & opportunities Etsy\u2019s full Board of Directors has overall responsibility for oversight of risk management at Etsy, including management of climate risk. The charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the \u201cN&CGC\u201d) of our Board of Directors provides that the N&CGC has responsibility for periodic review of our environmental and social Impact goals and our progress towards those goals. We typically report on our progress towards our Impact goals to the N&CGC or the full Board of Directors two times a year. The full Board of Directors also receives briefings, generally quarterly, on risk management-related topics, and the work of the Risk Steering Committee helps inform which risks are reported to the Board of Directors. (For a description of the Risk Steering Committee\u2019s activities, see below.) The full Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing significant acquisitions and other large scale capital expenditures. One of the criteria we use when evaluating acquisition opportunities is whether the transaction aligns with our mission, strategy, and values, including our Impact focus. In addition, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the disclosure in our Annual Report, which includes Impact disclosures, and our auditor\u2019s review of our Impact disclosures, and our Compensation Committee oversees our talent and employee development programs including our policies and strategies regarding diversity and inclusion. One member of our Board of Directors is experienced in sustainability accounting practices and is a Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\u201cSASB\u201d) FSA Credential Holder.

Management\u2019s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities Our Executive Team, including our CEO and CFO, review our environmental goals annually. Our CFO approves material capital expenditures, including those related to climate-related issues, such as renewable energy projects, and investments in verified emissions reductions. Oversight of climate risk at Etsy.com is supported by the Risk Steering Committee, a cross-functional management team which includes our CEO and CFO. This Committee meets at least quarterly to review and discuss the significant risks facing Etsy.com and its deliberations inform the risk management-related topics elevated to the Board of Directors.  Etsy, Inc.\u2019s Sustainability team, led by the Senior Director of Impact and Sustainability (the \u201cI&S Sr. Director\u201d), oversees Etsy\u2019s sustainability strategy and implementation, which includes climate impacts. The I&S Sr. Director reports to the VP, Strategic Sourcing and Marketplace Initiatives, who reports to the Chief Operations Officer, who is the Executive Sponsor for Etsy\u2019s Impact strategy. The I&S Sr. Director presents progress on environmental metrics each quarter to the Senior Leadership Team, including the CEO and CFO. The Impact Strategy Coordination Group, a cross-functional working group led by the I&S Sr. Director, coordinates ESG strategy and initiatives and meets bi-weekly. Etsy also has three cross-functional Impact Working Groups that all meet at least quarterly to manage the implementation of Impact projects and reporting.  40 40  40 Table of Contents Table of Contents Strategy Climate-related risks and opportunities identified & impact on strategy Etsy\u2019s climate strategy is informed by periodic identification and prioritization of climate-related risks and opportunities. In 2022, we deepened our analysis of climate impacts identified as part of our 2021 climate scenario analysis while continuing to strengthen internal engagement. To understand the degree to which a climate risk or opportunity could impact Etsy, the Impact team works with both external climate consultants and internal stakeholders to assess our current exposure and sensitivity, review existing controls, and analyze projected trends. To date, we have not identified any climate-related risks which are reasonably expected to have a material short-term impact on financial or strategic business operations. We believe that this is largely due to Etsy.com\u2019s marketplace model, the wide geographic distribution of our seller and buyer base, and our long-standing work to mitigate climate risks. However, due to the systemic nature of climate change and its intensifying global impacts, we are continuing to monitor and manage both climate-related risks and opportunities. The following disclosures highlight the identified climate-related impacts, as well as the ways in which our ESG strategy seeks to mitigate risks and leverage opportunities. We define short-term impacts as those expected to occur within 0-2 years, medium-term impacts as those expected to occur within 2-5 years, and long-term impacts as those expected to occur after 5 or more years. Etsy\u2019s ESG goal-setting process considers these climate-related impacts.

Long-TermCommodity MarketsOur analysis has indicated that the availability of commodities used by sellers, such as cotton, may face risks due to extreme weather. While we intend to analyze this risk in greater detail, because our marketplace features a broad assortment of items, we do not anticipate disproportionate short-term impacts on our business.We purchase carbon offsets to cover 100% of Etsy.com\u2019s measured annual emissions as part of our carbon neutrality commitment. Our research shows that under lower emissions scenarios, the price of carbon offsets is expected to increase dramatically. We mitigate this risk through multi-year off-take agreements while focusing on emissions reduction in line with our Net Zero target.ReputationCustomer and investor expectations of the role of corporations in society may grow beyond our current Impact efforts.Failure to meet employee expectations on Impact could affect recruitment, retention, and engagement of top talent.Medium-TermCustomer and Investor PerceptionsWe have already achieved or are on track to achieve many of our ambitious sustainability goals, including 100% renewable electricity and emissions reductions.

While we intend to analyze this risk in greater detail, because our marketplace features a broad assortment of items, we do not anticipate disproportionate short-term impacts on our business. We purchase carbon offsets to cover 100% of Etsy.com\u2019s measured annual emissions as part of our carbon neutrality commitment. Our research shows that under lower emissions scenarios, the price of carbon offsets is expected to increase dramatically. We mitigate this risk through multi-year off-take agreements while focusing on emissions reduction in line with our Net Zero target. Customer and Investor Perceptions We have already achieved or are on track to achieve many of our ambitious sustainability goals, including 100% renewable electricity and emissions reductions. We believe our continued efforts to reduce our environmental impact, improve ESG reporting, and engage our marketplace in sustainable shopping initiatives give us a competitive advantage.  Employee Perceptions We track how employees view Etsy\u2019s role in driving Impact and whether they believe Etsy is meeting expectations. Through our aforementioned efforts, we aim to ensure the gap between expectations and reality remains narrow.   \u2020 ISSB is the International Sustainability Standards Board and CSRD is the European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive Resilience of strategy across different climate-related scenarios Over the past few years, we have worked with two external vendors to assess current climate-related impacts and understand how they might change under different temperature pathways over time. In 2021, we conducted a qualitative scenario analysis in key markets across both our physical operations and marketplaces. As part of this process, exposure pathways were mapped to prioritized climate-related issues based on Etsy.com\u2019s business model, data availability, and internal stakeholder input. We used a range of representative concentration pathway (\u201cRCP\u201d) scenarios, with the lowest emissions scenario being RCP2.6 and the highest emission scenario being RCP8.5, as well as models and reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\u201cIPCC\u201d). Available climate scenario inputs and results were then collated and overlaid with Etsy.com\u2019s seller and buyer information in key geographies, allowing the analysis to pinpoint areas of concern. 42 42  42 Table of Contents Table of Contents Through this analysis we found that all key geographies are expected to face some degree of climate risk under different scenarios. However, because Etsy.com\u2019s buyer and seller base is distributed globally, we do not expect physical climate risks in any one geography to disproportionately impact the business under any scenario in the short-term. In addition, we believe our strategy, articulated above, will help us reduce transition risks associated with a 2 degree or lower scenario. We aim to continue improving our data collection and analysis on these topics to improve our understanding of long-term climate-related risks, quantify opportunities and, if necessary, update our strategic planning.  Risk Management Processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks Our climate risk identification and assessment process is integrated into our company-wide risk management. Our Sustainability Team, including the I&S Sr. Director and the Sustainability Manager, engages with key business functions to identify and evaluate climate risks that could have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the organization at least annually. The Sustainability Team and internal subject matter experts analyze risks in the context of our business, develop recommendations as appropriate, and escalate them for oversight by senior management through Etsy, Inc.\u2019s Risk Steering Committee (see Governance in this section above for more detail). For example, the Sustainability Team collaborates with the Advocacy Team to review climate policy proposals at the U.S. federal and state level and in key non-U.S. jurisdictions that might impact Etsy, the Analytics Team to monitor natural disaster impacts on buyers and sellers, and the Sourcing Team to review climate-related risks within our supplier\u00a0base.  Processes for managing climate-related risks The Sustainability Team works cross-functionally to develop management plans to address potential climate-related impacts. They develop and propose updates to environmental goals on an annual basis, including goals designed to mitigate climate risks, which are reviewed and approved by our Executive Team. For example, our goal to source 100% renewable electricity for office operations and computing load, which was achieved for 2020 through 2022, reduces our exposure to carbon pricing and increased fossil fuel costs. The Sustainability Team developed the goal, proposed short-term targets and strategies to measure and reach those targets, and solicited approval from the Executive Team, who ensured resources were provisioned and lines of accountability were appropriately set.  Processes for integrating climate-related risks into the overall risk management At Etsy.com, climate-related risks are managed as part of ESG risk and are seen as both underlying drivers of other types of risks as well as standalone risks. These risks, as well as their drivers, are monitored by the Sustainability Team. The I&S Sr. Director provides a written status update on potential ESG risks to Etsy\u2019s Risk Steering Committee typically quarterly. The work of the Risk Steering Committee helps inform which risks are reported to the Board of Directors.  Metrics and Targets Metrics used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with strategy and risk management\u00a0process We monitor metrics related to our public environmental targets including total energy consumed, renewable energy percent, grid electricity percent, Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions including product shipments, packaging, end-user energy use, water, and outgoing waste material streams. For a historical view of our metrics, please view pages 36-39 of this Annual Report.  Internally, we track a number of additional climate-related metrics. For example, since 2019, Etsy.com has been a carbon neutral business, offsetting 100% of our unabated carbon emissions across all measured Scope 1, 2, and 3 categories each year, which effectively acts as an internal price on our emissions. To this end, we track the annual carbon offset costs, offset cost savings from specific emissions reduction activities, and price projections for the voluntary carbon market. Related to natural disasters, we track GMS impacts from FEMA designated natural disasters as well as the percentage of our sellers and buyers in regions exposed to extreme weather events.  For all of our employees, compensation is tied to our financial performance, as well as individual contributions. While responsibility for delivering on our Impact goals is distributed across the Company, each goal owner is responsible for incorporating work associated with advancing their goal into team members\u2019 individual goals, which are considered when making compensation decisions. Members of our Executive Team also serve as executive sponsors for specific Impact goals to help ensure teams stay on track and have the value of executive leadership as plans are executed. Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions, and the related risks Please view pages 24-25 and 36-39 of this Annual Report for our GHG Emissions Summary. Targets used to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets Etsy has five climate-related targets: science-based emissions reduction, carbon neutrality, renewable energy, total energy use, and waste. Details of these targets including actions taken to achieve them and performance against each can be found on pages 25-27 of this Annual Report.  43 43  43  Table of Contents Table of Contents Available Information  We are subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and file or furnish reports, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC.
