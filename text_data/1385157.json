Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are usually the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets.Certain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases.Customer orders and demand may fluctuate as a result of economic and market conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows:\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bFiscal\u00a0Year\u00a0End\u00a0\u200b\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02023\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u200b\u00a0(in\u00a0millions)\u200bTransportation Solutions\u200b$ 2,981\u200b$ 3,179\u200bIndustrial Solutions\u200b\u00a0 2,448\u200b\u00a0 2,432\u200bCommunications Solutions\u200b\u00a0 617\u200b\u00a0 885\u200bTotal\u200b$ 6,046\u200b$ 6,496\u200bWe expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2023 will be filled during fiscal 2024. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods.CompetitionThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, downward pressure on prices. However, as a result of increased costs, certain of our businesses implemented price increases in fiscal 2023 and 2022.Raw MaterialsWe use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding; precious metals such as gold, silver, and palladium for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand. In recent years, raw material prices and\u00a0availability have been\u00a0affected by worldwide economic conditions,\u00a0including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures.Intellectual PropertyPatents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.We own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.4 Table of Contents Table of Contents Seasonality and BacklogTypically, we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are usually the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets.Certain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases.Customer orders and demand may fluctuate as a result of economic and market conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures.

Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods.CompetitionThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, downward pressure on prices. However, as a result of increased costs, certain of our businesses implemented price increases in fiscal 2023 and 2022.Raw MaterialsWe use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding; precious metals such as gold, silver, and palladium for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand. In recent years, raw material prices and\u00a0availability have been\u00a0affected by worldwide economic conditions,\u00a0including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures.Intellectual PropertyPatents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.We own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks.

As of fiscal year end 2023, we employed approximately 90,000 people worldwide, including contract employees. Approximately 38,000 were in the EMEA region, 25,000 were in the Asia\u2013Pacific region, and 27,000 were in the Americas region. Of our total employees, approximately 54,000 were employed in manufacturing. Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company\u2019s success. Our core values\u2014integrity, accountability, inclusion, teamwork, and innovation\u2014govern us. They guide our decisions and our actions, both individually and as an organization. Additionally, our employees are responsible for upholding our purpose\u2014to create a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. We track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, critical role pipeline data, diversity data, and engagement and inclusion indices. We aspire to have 30% of leadership roles filled by women by fiscal 2026 and are committed to increasing the total number of women across all levels of the organization. As part of its charter, the management development and compensation committee of our board of directors oversees our policies and practices related to the management of human capital resources including talent management, culture, diversity, and inclusion. We embrace diversity and inclusion. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences. We are committed to a work environment where all employees are engaged, feel differences are valued and mutually-respected, and believe that all opinions count. To drive our business outcomes globally, we believe we must build a workforce and supplier network that represents our global markets and the customers we serve. As such, our people reflect our customers and markets. Our employees are in over 50 countries representing approximately 135 nationalities, and our total employee population is over 40% women. Our employee resource groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) are company-sponsored, voluntary, employee-led groups that focus on diverse talent segments or shared experiences of employees. These groups apply those perspectives to create value for our company as a whole. The ERGs provide a space where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. As of fiscal year end 2023, we had eight ERGs\u2014ALIGN (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer employees (LGBTQ+) and their allies), Women in Networking, TE Young Professionals, African Heritage, Asian Heritage, Latin Heritage, THRIVE (employees with mental, emotional, and physical disabilities and their allies), and TE Veterans. Our ERGs have a total of approximately 9,500 members. During fiscal 2023, we conducted our fourth annual employee engagement survey, which was a fully digital, enterprise-wide survey available in 20 languages and focused on measuring engagement, inclusion, and leadership effectiveness. We had a participation rate of over 85% in fiscal 2023. Our inclusion and leadership effectiveness scores were consistent with fiscal 2022 results; however, our engagement score decreased slightly. Our engagement and inclusion scores were once again favorable when compared to Glint Inc.\u2019s external global manufacturing benchmark. By fiscal 2025, we aspire to be in the top tier of this benchmark on engagement and inclusion. We continue to emphasize employee development and training to support engagement and retention. To empower employees to unleash their potential, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources they need to be successful. Our LEARN@TE platform supplements our talent development strategies. It is an online portal that enables employees to access instructor-led classroom or virtual courses and self-directed web-based courses. Strategy, execution, and talent (\u201cSET\u201d) leadership expectations, which focus on how we drive strategy, effectively execute, and build talent, have been rolled out to all employees and are embedded in all of our leadership programs. We integrate these behavioral expectations into the way we assess and select talent, manage performance, and develop and reward our people. We are committed to identifying and developing our next generation of leaders. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in general management, engineering, and operations, as well as the diversity of our talent. We are focused on both the recruitment of diverse candidates and the development of our diverse employees to provide the opportunity to advance their careers and move into leadership positions within the company. On an annual basis, we conduct an organization and leadership review process with our chief executive officer and all segment, business unit, and function leaders focusing on our high-performing and high-potential talent, diverse talent, and the succession for our most critical roles. Also, our board of directors reviews and assesses management development plans for senior executives and the succession plans relating to those positions.5 Table of Contents Table of Contents While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents.Human Capital ManagementWe have employees located throughout the world.

For example, laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating GHG emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, available information, and applicable laws, as of fiscal year end 2023, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $17 million to $45 million, and we accrued $20 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range.

We remain focused on the protection of global human rights and have instituted several policies to guide us including our global human rights policy and our human trafficking and modern slavery policy. During fiscal 2023, we undertook a human rights risk assessment to identify areas of strength and risk for our operations and value chain, and we have developed a roadmap to strengthen our human rights approach. We apply high standards of human rights and require that our suppliers do the same. We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see \u201cPart 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Government Regulation and Supervision The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding trade compliance matters. Also, see \u201cPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with trade regulations. Environmental Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Restriction of Hazardous Substances (\u201cRoHS\u201d) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cWEEE\u201d) Directives; the China Administrative Measures for the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products (\u201cChina RoHS\u201d) regulation; the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) regulation; and similar laws. Compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating GHG emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, available information, and applicable laws, as of fiscal year end 2023, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $17 million to $45 million, and we accrued $20 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2024 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to GHG emissions. Sustainability We look to build on our strong foundation of environmental sustainability in our operations. Our One Connected World strategy guides how we balance investor and customer expectations and drive improved environmental sustainability.  Our sustainability initiatives began several years ago and have continued to evolve. From fiscal 2020 to 2023, we achieved more than a 20% reduction in energy use intensity, more than a 15% reduction in total water withdrawal, and more than a 60% reduction in absolute GHG emissions for Scopes 1 and 2. We have challenged ourselves to find new ways to  6 6 6  Table of Contentscontinue to drive sustainability improvements. We have also committed to near-term, company-wide emissions reductions in line with climate science and Science Based Targets initiative (\u201cSBTi\u201d) objectives. We have established a number of mid-term goals and long-term ambitions including the following:\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bTargeted Fiscal Year\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u200b\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Baseline Fiscal Year\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of Achievement\u200b70%+ reduction in absolute GHG emissions for Scopes 1 and 2\u200b2020\u200b2030\u200b15% reduction in water withdrawals at target sites with extremely high and high water stress\u200b2021\u200b2025\u200b15% reduction in hazardous waste disposed\u200b2021\u200b2025\u200b80% renewable electricity use in our operations\u200bn/a\u200b2025\u200bWhile sustainability is embedded in our operations, we are exploring opportunities with our direct suppliers and logistics service providers to strengthen the environmental sustainability of our supply chain. The majority of our GHG emissions are from the goods and services we use in our operations. In addition to improving the sustainability of our operations and working with our suppliers to reduce their GHG emissions, we help our customers produce smaller, lighter, and more energy-efficient products, reducing the environmental impact of the products our customers make through the life of their products.
