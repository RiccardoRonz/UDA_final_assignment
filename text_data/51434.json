BUSINESS   GENERAL  International Paper Company (the \"Company\" or \"International Paper\", which may also be referred to as \"we\" or \"us\") is a global producer of renewable fiber-based packaging and pulp products with manufacturing operations in North America, Latin America, Europe and North Africa. We are a New York corporation, incorporated in 1941 as the successor to the New York corporation of the same name organized in 1898. You can learn more about us by visiting our website at www.internationalpaper.com.  In the United States, at December\u00a031, 2022, the Company operated 24 pulp and packaging mills, 164 converting and packaging plants, 16 recycling plants and three bag facilities. Production facilities at December\u00a031, 2022 in Canada, Europe, North Africa and Latin America included four pulp and packaging mills, 37 converting and packaging plants, and two recycling plants. We operate a printing and packaging products distribution business principally through six branches in Asia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions.  For management and financial reporting purposes, our businesses are separated into two segments: Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers.

Of our U.S. employees, approximately 22,700 are hourly, with unions representing approximately 14,000 employees. Approximately 10,600 of this number are represented by the United Steelworkers union (\"USW\").International Paper, the USW, and several other unions have entered into four master agreements covering various U.S. mills and converting facilities. These master agreements cover several specific items, including wages, select benefit programs, successorship, employment security, and health and safety.  Individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other subjects not covered by the master agreements. If local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration, under the terms of the master agreements the local contracts will automatically renew with the same terms in effect. The master agreements cover the majority of our union represented mills and converting facilities. In addition, International Paper is party to a master agreement with District Council 2, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, covering additional converting facilities. SAFETYThe safety of our employees remains the primary focus of our leaders. Our goal is to create a 100% injury-free workplace for our employees and contractors. To accomplish this goal, we focus on the IP Way of doing things -  we do the right things, in the right ways, for the right reasons, all of the time. Our stated Vision 2030 Goal is to achieve zero serious injuries for employees and contractors.  We regularly conduct safety leadership training at all levels of the Company. In 2022, 93% of our sites operated without a serious injury, which we define as a life-altering specific injury, to our employees.  HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe attraction, retention and development of our employees is critical to our success. We accomplish this, in part, by developing the capabilities of our team members through our continuous learning, development and performance management programs. One such program is our REACH (Recruit, Engage, Align College Hires) program through which we recruit and develop early-career engineers and safety professionals for our U.S. mills, preparing them to become future leaders. We invest in the growth and development of our employees by providing a multi-dimensional approach to learning that empowers, intellectually grows, and professionally develops our employees. Our HR Talent Management Team hosts online Global New Employee Orientation for employees and each business conducts onsite new hire integration training unique to its business and/or facility. We provide continuing education courses that are relevant to our industry and job functions within the Company, including both instructor lead and online training through our MyLearning platform. In addition, we have created learning paths for specific positions that are designed to encourage an employee\u2019s advancement and growth within our organization, such as our Global Manufacturing Training Initiative, which provides training services to hourly operations and maintenance employees in our mills in a standardized and structured manner.  On the converting side of our business, approximately 200 front line and future leaders participated in our multi-day in-person Leadership Application and Professional Development and Manufacturing Management Associate Programs. Across the enterprise in 2022, employees completed 3.4 million learning activities through our Learning Management Service (LMS) system. The IP Leadership Institute offers both LMS and other courses for individual contributors, people leaders and teams. We also offer a peer mentor program and leadership and customer service training to support and develop our employees. Moreover, we offer tuition reimbursement programs for employees who desire to receive additional outside education to prepare for other positions at the Company, as well as student loan assistance to help employees repay qualified student loans. These resources provide employees with the skills and support they need to achieve their career goals, build management skills and become leaders within our Company.The labor market for both hourly and salaried workers has recently been increasingly competitive.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONAs responsible stewards of people and communities, natural resources and capital, stewardship is one of the Company's core values. Our Vision 2030 Goals provide a framework to build a better future for people, the planet and the Company in the areas of healthy and abundant forests, thriving people and communities, sustainable operations and renewable solutions. Through these efforts and more, the Company tackles the toughest issues in the value chain to improve its environmental footprint and promote the long-term sustainability of natural capital. As part of its business, the Company is subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal, state local, and international laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. For example, Company manufacturing processes involve discharges to water, air emissions, water intake and waste handling and disposal activities, all of which are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, along with requirements of environmental permits or analogous authorizations issued by various governmental authorities. In addition, new environmental laws or regulations impacting our facilities around the world are routinely passed or proposed. Our continuing objectives include: (1) controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities to avoid adverse impacts on the environment, and (2) maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company spent approximately $30 million in 2022 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water, and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste. We expect to spend approximately $39 million in 2023 for environmental capital projects. Capital expenditures on environmental projects for 2024 and 2025, respectively, are anticipated to be approximately $35 million and $26 million. It is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions, estimates and project completion dates may change, and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering projects, varying costs or changes in environmental laws and regulations.  The Company has completed capital projects to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA\") maximum achievable control technology (\"MACT\") and risk and technology review (\"RTR\") regulations that require owners of specified pulp and paper process equipment and boilers to meet new air emissions standards for certain substances.

Many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA and equivalent state laws, as a practical matter, liability for CERCLA cleanups is typically allocated among the many PRPs. There are other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the Company\u2019s current, closed or formerly-owned facilities, and recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet. For additional information regarding certain remediation actions, see Note 14 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data on pages 71 through 75.

Risk Factors \u2013 WE ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY CHANGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS, AND THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CLIMATE CHANGEThe Company recognizes the impacts of climate change on people and our planet. In order to manage climate-related risks, we are taking actions throughout our value chain to help advance a low-carbon economy.  We aligned our annual sustainability reporting with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in the 2022 reporting cycle (based upon data from 2021). We identify and evaluate physical and transition climate-related risks through our enterprise risk management process.We transform renewable resources into recyclable products that people depend on every day. This cycle begins with sourcing renewable fiber from responsibly managed forests and recycled raw materials to create our products.  We then use a circular manufacturing process that makes the most of resources and byproducts, while reducing the environmental impacts of our operations. At the end of use, the majority ofour low-carbon products are recycled into new products at a higher rate than any other base material. We work to advance the shift to a low-carbon, circular economy by designing products that are 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable.  Through improvements in operations, equipment, energy efficiency and fuel diversity, we have achieved company-wide reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, we reduced our GHG emissions by approximately 20% between 2010 and 2020. Moreover, as part of our Vision 2030 goals, we have targeted incremental reductions of 35% in our Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions in comparison to 2019 levels. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approved these targets as consistent with levels required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, an agreement signed among over 170 countries, which became effective in November 2016. We intend to continue to evaluate and implement projects as we pursue this Vision 2030 GHG goal. This includes ongoing energy efficiency efforts and capital projects to phase out our most carbon intensive fuel sources (Scope 1) as well as developing GHG reduction strategies for our energy sourcing (Scope 2) and broader supply chain footprint (Scope 3).  We use carbon-neutral biomass and manufacturing residuals (rather than fossil fuels) to generate a majority of the manufacturing energy at our mills. We believe our efforts to advance sustainable forest management and restore forest landscapes are an important lever for mitigating climate change through carbon storage in forests. INTERNATIONAL EFFORTSThe Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016 and compels international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing the emissions of GHGs. Consistent with this objective, participating countries aim to balance GHG emissions generation and sequestration in the second half of this century or, in effect, achieve net-zero global GHG emissions.  To assist member countries in meeting GHG reduction obligations, the EU operates an Emissions Trading System (\"EU ETS\"). Our operations in the EU experience indirect impacts of the EU ETS through purchased power pricing. Neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the EU ETS have been material to the Company, but they could be material to the Company in the future depending on how the Paris Agreement's non-binding commitments or allocation of, and market prices for, GHG credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years. been remanded to EPA for further consideration it is not clear at this time what, if any, additional capital project expenditures might result from resolution of the open issues.The Company has been named as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\").

The EPA manages regulations to: (i) control GHGs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards; (ii) control GHG emissions from new Electric Generating Units (\"EGUs\"); (iii) control emissions from new oil and gas processing operations; and (iv) require reporting of GHGs from sources of GHGs greater than 25,000 tons per year.  Several U.S. states, including states in which we operate facilities, have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction and reporting of emissions of GHGs by companies and public utilities. California, New York and Virginia have already enacted such programs, although these regulations have not had, and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. We monitor proposed programs in other states as well; however, it is unclear what impacts, if any, future state-level or local GHG rules will have on the Company\u2019s operations.  SUMMARYRegulation related to GHGs and climate change continues to evolve in the areas of the world in which we do business. However, while it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding GHGs and climate change in the future, it is unclear what actions will be taken and when such actions will occur and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate the Company\u2019s costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future. In addition to possible direct impacts, future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on the Company, such as higher prices for transportation, energy and other inputs, as well as more protracted air permitting processes, causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects. The Company has controls and procedures in place to track GHG emissions from our facilities, as well as to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate-related laws, regulations, accords, and policies in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions where we operate. We regularly assess whether such developments may have a material effect on the Company, its operations or financial condition, and whether we have any related disclosure obligations under applicable rules and regulations.Moreover, compliance with legal requirements related to GHGs and/or climate change which are currently in effect or may be enacted in the future may require future expenditures to meet GHG emission reduction obligations. These obligations may include carbon taxes, the requirement to purchase GHG credits or the need to acquire carbon offsets.  We may also incur significant expenditures in relation to our efforts to meet our internal targets or goals with respect to GHGs and climate change, including our Vision 2030 goal on GHGs as set forth above.  Furthermore, in connection with complying with legal requirements and/or our efforts to meet our internal targets and goals, we have made and expect to continue to make capital and other investments to displace traditional fossil fuels, such as fuel oil and coal, with lower carbon alternatives, such as biomass and natural gas.  Currently, these efforts and obligations have not materially impacted the Company but such efforts and obligations may have a material impact on the Company in the future.  We believe global citizenship is a key element of corporate governance promoted by our Board of Directors and senior management. The Public Policy and Environment Committee of the Board has overall oversight responsibility for global citizenship at the Company.  This Committee reviews and oversees environmental sustainability (including climate change), public policy, legal, health and safety and technology issues.

If any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures.RISKS RELATING TO MARKET AND ECONOMICFACTORSADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. General economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  We may also be adversely affected by catastrophic or other unforeseen events, including future health epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters, geopolitical events, terrorism, political, financial or social instability, or civil or social unrest.  Moreover, negative economic conditions or other adverse developments with respect to our business have resulted in, and may in the future result in impairment charges which could be material. Volatility or uncertainty in the financial, capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations. Macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and globally continue to be challenging in various respects, including as the result of slow or negative GDP growth in recent quarters, significant inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates, challenging labor market conditions, and disruptions to supply networks. Our operations have been adversely affected by, and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by, these negative macroeconomic conditions, including as the result of higher raw material and labor costs, supply chain constraints and disruptions, and a constrained transportation environment. Moreover, any significant deterioration in current negative macroeconomic conditions, or any recovery therefrom that is significantly slower than anticipated, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further if current negative macroeconomic conditions result in significant disruptions to capital and financial markets, our cost of borrowing, our ability to access capital on favorable terms, and our overall liquidity could be adversely affected.CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS OR OTHER RISKS ARISING FROM CONDUCTING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the U.S. in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. These risks, which can vary substantially by country, may include economic or political instability, geopolitical events (such as between Ukraine and Russia and/or increasing tensions between China and Taiwan), corruption, anti-American sentiment, social and ethnic unrest, the regulatory environment (including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements), fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, repatriating cash from foreign countries to the U.S., downturns or changes in economic conditions (including in relation to commodity inflation), adverse tax consequences or rulings, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries  statements can be found in our press releases and SEC filings. In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that we currently believe to be immaterial could affect the accuracy of any forward-looking statements.
