{"cik": 1289490, "item_1A": "Item\u00a01. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business General Extra Space Storage\u00a0Inc. (\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) formed as a Maryland corporation on April\u00a030, 2004. We closed our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) on August\u00a017, 2004. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cEXR.\u201d We were formed to continue the business of Extra Space Storage\u00a0LLC and its subsidiaries, which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. These companies were reorganized after the consummation of our IPO and various formation transactions. Our executive management team and board of directors have extensive experience and ownership positions in the Company.  Substantially all of our business is conducted through Extra Space Storage LP (the \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d). Our primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d). To the extent we continue to qualify as a REIT we will not be subject to U.S. federal tax, with certain exceptions, on our REIT taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders. Our principal offices are located at 2795 East Cottonwood Parkway, Suite 300, Salt Lake City, Utah 84121, telephone number (801) 365-4600. Our internet address is www.extraspace.com. We file our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). You may obtain copies of these documents by visiting the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are furnished to the SEC, we make copies of these documents available to the public free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website.  Self-Storage Operations We own, operate, manage, provide lending to, acquire, develop and redevelop self-storage properties (\u201cstores\u201d). We operate and manage our business by evaluating the operating performance of the properties for our entire portfolio which includes wholly-owned stores, stores in which we have a partial ownership interest and managed stores. Stores offer month-to-month rental of storage space for personal or business use. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we owned and/or operated 2,338 stores in 41 states, and Washington, D.C., comprising approximately 176.1 million square feet of net rentable space in approximately 1.6 million units. Other Operations Our tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores.  Our customers have the option of purchasing insurance from a non-affiliated insurance company to cover certain losses to their goods stored at our facilities, as well as those we manage for third parties. A wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary fully reinsures such policies and thereby assumes all risk of losses under these policies and receives reinsurance premiums substantially equal to the premiums collected from our tenants, from the non-affiliated insurance company. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we managed 887 stores for third party owners. Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees as well as expand our geographic footprint, data sophistication and scale with little capital investment. We believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a potential future acquisition pipeline. We have a bridge lending program, under which we provide financing to third party self storage owners for operating properties that we manage.  This program helps us increase our management business, create additional potential future acquisition opportunities, and strengthen our relationships with partners, all while generating interest and fee income. We generally originate mortgage loans and mezzanine loans, with the intent to sell many of the mortgage loans to third parties, while retaining our interests in the mezzanine loans. As of December\u00a031, 2022, the total principal balance of bridge loans receivable was $491.9 million. 4 4 4    We have made investments in preferred stock of other self-storage companies. These investments benefit us by providing dividend income, increasing our management business, and creating additional potential future acquisition opportunities through relationships with the companies in which we invest. Operating Segments We operate in two distinct segments: (1)\u00a0self-storage operations; and (2)\u00a0tenant reinsurance. Our self-storage operations activities include rental operations of wholly-owned stores.  Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores.  For more information and comparative financial and other information on our reportable business segments, refer to the segment information footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Long-Term Growth and Investment Strategies Our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable long-term growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term stockholder value both at acceptable levels of risk. We continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities.  Our primary strategies include the following: Maximize the performance of our stores through strategic, efficient and proactive management We pursue revenue-generating and expense-minimizing opportunities in our operations. We seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems' ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management. Our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more dynamic online marketing programs, which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost. We continually analyze our portfolio to look for long-term value-enhancing opportunities.  We proactively redevelop properties to add units or modify existing unit mix to better meet the demand in a given market and to maximize revenue.  We also redevelop properties to reduce their effective useful age, increase visual appeal, enhance security and to improve brand consistency across the portfolio. Acquire self-storage stores Our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multi-store portfolios and single stores which can range from fully occupied to various stages of lease-up that we believe can provide stockholder value. We have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. In addition, we believe our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals.  We remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value. In addition to the pursuit of operating stores, from time to time we develop stores from the ground up and provide the construction capital.  We also purchase stores at the completion of construction from third party developers, who build to our specifications.  These stores purchased at completion of construction (a \"Certificate of Occupancy store\"), create additional long-term value for our stockholders.  We are typically able to acquire these assets at a lower price than a stabilized store, and expect greater long term returns on these stores on average. However, in the short term, these acquisitions cause dilution to our earnings during the two-to-four year period required to lease up the Certificate of Occupancy stores.  We expect that this trend will continue as we continue to acquire Certificate of Occupancy stores. Financing of Our Long-Term Growth Strategies As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90%of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders.  Consequently, we require access to additional sources of capital to fund our growth. We expect to maintain a flexible approach to financing growth. We plan to finance future acquisitions, store development and our bridge loan program through a diverse capital optimization strategy which includes but is not limited to: cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving lines of credit (the \"Credit Lines\"), secured and unsecured financing, equity offerings, joint ventures and the sale of stores. Credit Lines - We have two credit lines which we primarily use as short-term bridge financing until we obtain longer-term financing through either debt or equity.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, our Credit Lines had available capacity of $1.4 billion, of which $445.0 million was undrawn. 5 5 5    Secured and Unsecured Debt - We primarily use public bonds, unsecured private placement bonds and unsecured bank term loans to finance store acquisitions and development efforts. We will continue to utilize a combination of secured and unsecured financing for future store acquisitions and development.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had $1.3 billion of secured notes payable and $5.1 billion of unsecured notes payable outstanding. Equity - We have an active \"at the market\" (\"ATM\") program for selling stock.  We sell stock under the ATM program from time to time to raise capital when we believe conditions are advantageous. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, we didn't issue or sell any shares of common stock. We view equity interests in our Operating Partnership as another source of capital that can provide an attractive tax planning opportunity to sellers of real estate.  We issue common and preferred Operating Partnership units to sellers in certain acquisitions.  Common Operating Partnership units receive distributions equal to the dividends on common stock, while Preferred Operating Partnership units receive distributions at various negotiated rates.  We may issue additional units in the future when circumstances are favorable. Joint Ventures - As of December\u00a031, 2022, we owned 319 of our stores through joint ventures with third parties.  Our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the acquisition of stores owned in these joint ventures.  Most joint venture agreements include buy-sell rights, as well as rights of first offer in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture.  We manage the day-to-day operations of the stores owned in these joint ventures and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture, but do not control the joint ventures. Sale of Properties - We have not historically sold a high volume of stores, as we generally believe we are able to optimize the cash flow from stores through continued operations.  However, we may sell more stores or interests in stores in the future in response to changing economic, financial or investment conditions.  For the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, we sold two stores for $38.7 million. Industry & Competition We are the second largest self-storage operator in the United States. Our four primary competitors who are public self-storage REITs are CubeSmart, Life Storage, National Storage Affiliates and Public Storage. Stores offer month-to-month rental of storage space for personal or business use.  Tenants typically rent fully enclosed spaces that vary in size and typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet, with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet.  Tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units.  Stores generally have on-site managers who supervise and run the day-to-day operations, providing tenants with assistance as needed. Self-storage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes, or simply because of a need for storage space. The mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store\u2019s local demographics and often includes people who are experiencing life changes such as downsizing their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence. Items that tenants place in self-storage are typically furniture, household items and appliances.  Commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods, records, inventory or storage for seasonal goods. Our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business, making high-density, high-traffic population centers ideal locations for stores. A store\u2019s visibility on the internet, price, perceived security, cleanliness, and the general professionalism of the store managers and staff are also contributing factors to a store\u2019s ability to successfully secure rentals. Although most stores are leased to tenants on a month-to-month basis, tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time. The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are typically realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. The self-storage industry is a mature industry that has seen the average occupancy continue to increase.  According to the Self-Storage Almanac (the \u201cAlmanac\u201d), the national average physical occupancy rate was 90.2% of net rentable square feet in 2015, compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 93.4% in 2022.  Our average occupancy for wholly-owned stores for 2022 was 93.3%. The industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership. According to the Almanac, as of the end of 2022, the top ten self-storage companies in the United States operated approximately 24.2% of the total U.S. stores, and the top 50 self-storage  6 6 6    companies operated approximately 31.9% of the total U.S. stores. We believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future. We believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions.  We have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire existing operating stores, especially for brokered portfolios. Competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities, and this will likely continue.   Regulation Generally, stores are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Changes in any of these laws or regulations, as well as changes in laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act, which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores, or laws affecting development, construction, operation, limitations on rent increases due to state of emergency or similar orders, upkeep, safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of stores or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In addition, noncompliance with any of these laws, ordinances or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could require substantial capital expenditures to ensure compliance. Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.  Store management activities may be subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.  Our collection and processing of personal information may be subject to various data privacy and security laws, which govern the collection, use, disclosure of personal information and are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts and can results in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. Changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Human Capital  At Extra Space, our culture is driven by our belief that our people are a key driver in our success. We believe that if we focus on attracting, developing, and retaining diverse top talent at all levels of the organization, our employees will take care of our customers and drive growth for our shareholders.  As of December\u00a031, 2022, we had 4,781 employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement. In 2022, we invited our employees to participate in an employee satisfaction survey. We achieved an overall satisfaction score of 79% with over 91% of our employees participating in our survey.   Compensation, Health and Well Being  We offer competitive health benefits and encourage our employees to participate in employee health and wellness programs. Over 58% of our employees who are enrolled in our health plan participate in these programs. We offer individualized counseling to our employees to assist them with their journey towards better health. We also offer other health-oriented benefits such as smoking cessation programs and a fitness program that allows for reimbursements to employees for expenses incurred relating to fit-friendly activities, sports or exercise equipment.   Training and Development  In order to attract and retain diverse top talent, we offer training and development opportunities for our employees. In 2022, we invested in training and development for our employees, which included leadership training, communication training, individual learning plans, site manager training and mentorship programs. Our field employees received an average of eight hours of training and each new hire received an average of 82 hours of training in 2022. Additionally, we provide our employees with an education assistance program through Western Governors University that allows our employees a path to an undergraduate degree in business or information technology through scholarships and other assistance.    7 7 7    Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  We value diversity, equity and inclusion and undertake a wide spectrum of initiatives to attract and retain a diverse workforce. During 2022, we expanded participation in our employee resource groups that provide our employees a space to build community by celebrating their culture, providing mentoring opportunities and developing educational content for Extra Space. We will continue to implement and pursue diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and tracking that allow us to attract and retain diverse top talent, improve employee engagement, increase innovation and customer insight and enhance the quality of our decision making. We also launched a formal internship program with Project Destined to support a more diverse talent pipeline into real estate professions. Utah Business Magazine recently recognized us as one of the top 100 Companies Championing Women.  Our employee population is approximately 47% female and approximately 44% have self-identified as people of color: Black or African American (16%), Hispanic or Latino (20%), Asian (2.4%), of two or more races (4.2%), Native American (0.6%), and Pacific Islander (0.5%).  We believe that our emphasis on training and development, employee safety, employee health and well-being, and a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion leads to an increase in employee productivity and positions us to attract and retain top diverse talent.
